| 0:05:24| but as you approach the podium, Director Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| will you please read us Planning Commission's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Planning Commission recommends approve the sector plan amendment to CC community commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=330)|

| 0:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Mr. Graham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| How long do I have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| A decent amount of time, at least five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Oh, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| I'm glad I wasn't late, this fastest I've ever got in front of you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| So this is a small part of expansion of Crown Point Plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=355)|
| 0:06:00| which is on the first page of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Bottom right-hand corner, we're building two retail buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Started off as one, 8,000 to 10,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| With the growth of Knoxville and the demand from retail tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| we moved the camper top place across the street and have added another building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| So we pushed the pause button last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| and I think we're almost through to get our permit with this guy over here on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| but for the phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| But we are asking for, I respectfully ask for CA zoning for what we're requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=396)|
| 0:06:43| 85%, if you look on the back page, I believe, 85% of the center is already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=403)|
| 0:06:53| The only thing we have is the front part, which some of it's in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| and then the anchor pad back beside Hobby Lobby on your front sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| We're not accessing, there's two entrances to this property now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| and we're shifting them just barely to meet TDOT requirements, city requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| but we're not accessing from Cherry Brook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| so we're not increasing any traffic into the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| The second page is our landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| and I've never done a landscape plan this extensive, I must confess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| I've done buffers, which is the green part, which buffers Cherry Brook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| but we're going to have a beautiful center here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| It's going to be, if you go to the third page, it's going to be Turkey Creek level architectural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| You can see we'll have a little courtyard there in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| It'll be a beautiful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| You know, this has become the third largest retail area in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| behind West Town and Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| This Clinton Highway, Callahan Road is really popping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| and, you know, you go to the sector plan, it's all commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| Additional buffer, if you want to look at the aerial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| goes all along the back of the houses that border Cherry Brook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| and we've also relocated and built a new detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=497)|
| 0:08:23| That's what will address drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| The pond's probably twice as big as it was when it was built in the 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| and it was relocated to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| That next picture is a Google photo from Cherry Brook Drive that looks at the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=513)|
| 0:08:42| You can see it's well buffered there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| The last page with the blue and green, I like coloring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| I got an A in coloring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| But the last page is the green is basically the new detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| and the blue are my neighbors that have all signed a letter or sent me an e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| that they're not opposed to my requested zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=543)|
| 0:09:08| And then the very last page, again, is a zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| So with that said, I don't need any more practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| I'm 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| I don't need any more practice going through a use-own-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| and there's really not much to plan with my existing site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| and what's already built out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| So I'd really like to have, instead of four zones in the county, just one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=567)|
| 0:09:32| That would be CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=573)|
| 0:09:36| Thank you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Shawna Brooks, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Shawna Brooks, 1707 Cherry Brook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| Oh, thanks for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| I'm a property owner who lives in the neighborhood that he's referring to as buffered in his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=591)|
| 0:10:03| I do want to clarify, it sounds like you've been talking about both of the agenda items together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| You're not talking about the first one separately from the second one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| I see them as one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| That's my purpose, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| I think it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| I speak on behalf of myself because I've already had to spend more than $9,000 correcting damage to my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| that has been done because the retention pond he built, the trees that took down to make that retention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| and whatever grading happened to get in there has dramatically increased the volume of flow behind our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| And it is literally, it's ripped soil away from my fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| It's ripped the soil underneath a tree that all you can see is the roots on like a half of the tree now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=647)|
| 0:10:55| because the soil has been flushed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| And I am only one, and there are a number of neighbors who've had other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| And the biggest concern I have is that while there is accountability if things don't go the way he plans for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=663)|
| 0:11:12| or intends for them to, that is after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| And we are aware that there are at least some issues with the current plan that are being addressed with notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=677)|
| 0:11:27| And we want to get ahead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| So if this project, as an entire project, is zoned for planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=690)|
| 0:11:38| and we have the ability to intervene and provide stakeholder feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| to whatever the part of the county government that will approve that plan is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=705)|
| 0:11:53| then I, as an individual, feel much more comfortable than if either by way of the sector plan change or some other method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=713)|
| 0:12:05| this entire project is not zoned for planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=725)|
| 0:12:11| Again, I would like for our neighborhood to definitely have the opportunity to participate in the design review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=731)|
| 0:12:21| so that our concerns can be addressed as part of that design before any of the development is authorized to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=741)|
| 0:12:31| That's all I have, but we have other people that might want to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| 1707 Cherrybrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Is there anyone else here to speak in opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| Ma'am, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| Hi, I'm Lisa Wallace. I live at 1603 Cherrybrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| I've been there close to 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| My husband has been there his entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| It was my husband's family's peach farm from 1900 on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| The barn that stands there, his grandfather built, so we know very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| We can't hear you. We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| I would say my husband's family's been there since 1900, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| It was his family's peach farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| His grandfather built the barn that stands there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| There's bubbling springs under all kinds of property there in the neighborhood people don't even know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| That being said, I do know the habits of the water flow in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| First, let me say I'm not against progress whatsoever or building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| I know that that has to happen for continued growth and revenue for the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| That's not the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| We're just requesting that a pause button be set or the planned commercial be, you know, taken seriously here today to protect all of our neighborhood from potentially just being deteriorated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=815)|
| 0:13:50| Foremost, what we're asking for is this body's help in determining the true safety of our neighborhood in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| It would give us the opportunity to get some environmental studies to check on how we can keep the water flow from washing away our yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=835)|
| 0:14:06| We have had 12 trees we've lost in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| We have two trees that have fallen today in that creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| The violation that she was speaking about was just issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| It's behind my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| The creek bed behind my house is full of crushing run construction debris, concrete, and I don't know what that has like a rainbow glow and foam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| Now we've lost a pet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| Our yard stays full for three to four days after rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| I can't have my grandson out there and I can't let my dogs in my yard anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| And this is all happened since the additional construction since the additional stuff has been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| When all that first started, our whole yard was orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| We have a collection at the back of my fence I've left so anybody can come see it of debris that is this thick now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| And it just, when the water runs off, it remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| We're experiencing, like I said, all the grass in the back of our yard has died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| We spent over $1,000 hiring a landscape company to come in to try to fix the problem, and they said they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| There's something wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Something's poisoning our soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| And like she was stating, we just want the opportunity for a pause button to be set or something to be done to give us the opportunity to make sure that, as taxpayers and citizens, we have a right to say, please help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=912)|
| 0:15:24| You all are the last place we have to go, and we need your help as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| As far as the landscape plan, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| I'm very hesitant about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Like I said, I've been there for years and years, and I've seen promises made that never came to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| And that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| I would want more than just a handshake guarantee or an assurance, but this gentleman assured me there would be a bond today, and that did make me feel a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| But just please consider the damage that's being done to people's homes that we have spent a lifetime paying for, that we want to be an inheritance to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=950)|
| 0:16:00| And we want to stay ahead of this, like she was saying, because there's nothing worse than being on the rear end of it and trying to fix a problem that's already happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=960)|
| 0:16:09| We just want the opportunity to stay ahead of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| My husband's a combat veteran, and we're experiencing now that inability to stay ahead of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| We just found out all the things he was exposed to 20 years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| I don't want my grandson 20 years from now to find out he was exposed to toxins in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| So that's all I have to say tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| But please, please respectfully consider that and help our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=991)|
| 0:16:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=997)|
| 0:16:48| Commissioner Jay, would you like to go ahead, or would you like to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| I'll defer to the district commissioner first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| I do have some questions, but in respect to the district commissioner, I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Mr. Graham, first of all, thank you for spending a considerable amount of time with me to go over this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| We met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| We talked on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I've read the letters, a number of the people in the neighborhood that approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| And then I appreciate the people coming out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| We did discuss with Mr. Snowden some of their concerns that are ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| Mr. Snowden, could you come up to the podium so I could ask you a few questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| Could you explain to the commission about some of this is city, some of it is TDEC, and all that, how it applies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1049)|
| 0:17:39| Yeah, it's a little bit of a mess out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| You've got TDEC that oversees, obviously, some of the issues related to waters of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1061)|
| 0:17:49| You've got the city that has a jurisdiction out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| You've got Knox County that's got a jurisdiction out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| And as Tim mentioned, you've got TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| So you've got a lot of jurisdictions out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| The site, I think TDEC, the city has issued the grading permit for the work that's currently going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1080)|
| 0:18:08| We have a concurrent grading permit also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| And then he's got a TDOT entrance permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| So it is ‑‑ there's a lot of different jurisdictions out there that are working to make sure that Mr. Graham, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1094)|
| 0:18:23| is doing per his plan, which ‑‑ so does that kind of help you give some context there, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| Yes, and I wanted to reassure the citizens too that the enforcement of what would be required of Mr. Graham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| about how his permit and the bond, if you could explain that, that would hold him up if he doesn't do everything he's supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Mr. Graham, when he submits his design plans, as we approve those, we give him a bond amount that he is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1127)|
| 0:18:56| before we give him a grading permit to ensure that we can stabilize the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| that we can enforce any conditions such as landscaping to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| that everything that is on that plan is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| We require Mr. Graham to put in, to submit an as‑built to ensure that all the drainage features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| that, you know, the pond volumes and all those drainage hydrology features are done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| so that the downstream owners can be made whole again in the sense of that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| there's no additional water or any, you know, effects that would negatively impact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| Mr. Graham, if I could ask you to come back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| could you explain a little bit about what you're going to do about the flooding and the storm water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| a little bit better to the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| So most of the, right now, all the drainage goes into the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| It's a wet weather conveyance that, now I don't know what it does on past my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| but the section that I join is a wet weather conveyance as determined by TDAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| but all the water presently goes into that ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| When we're through with our, you know, we push the pause button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| we haven't put in all our storm pipes that will redirect most of the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| into and through our detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| I'll just say, you know, we've had a lot of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| I live on, I live in Carnes on a bunch of acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| I've had a lot of trees that have fallen or, you know, it, but I can't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| I haven't done analysis of how much rain and how bad it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| I was made aware of a couple of these things just this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| We'll certainly address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| I've lived here my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Everybody knows where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| I'm not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| We'll do the right thing, and as Mr. Stoughton said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| we put a bond up that can be drawn on if we don't do what we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| and I think I have a pretty good track record, and it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| if you make me go through a planned commercial, fine, I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| I've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| It's just, as you see, there's five different zones, and we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| and these issues that are brought up aren't a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| They're an engineer issue, a construction issue, a performance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| They're not whether this should be CA or PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| and I think, you know, the CA zone is a reasonable zone in light of all the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| and all the CB that's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| The area in the front is CH2, which is in the city, and that's more like a CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| So we're, you know, it's a challenge to get permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| and to build things in this day and time, and so if you can indulge me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| and I think that, you know, our track record speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| Did you have other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| That's all I have for now, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| About three or four of my questions already got answered, but I did have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| Mr. Welch, the applicant has asked for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| Does the sector plan being changed to community commercial allow for CA without all the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1333)|
| 0:22:23| Yeah, it would allow for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| as the sector plan, but right now community commercial is what the sector plan is being asked to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1346)|
| 0:22:35| The property that he's asking to be added, changed is to community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| I mean, we have two different actions, but if the first one were to be approved on community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| would it allow for CA in the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| I'm sorry, for the second neighbor who, I'm sorry, I couldn't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1371)|
| 0:22:58| I couldn't hear your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| I'm trying to look at a map and I can see where Ms. Brooks lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| It's Lisa Wallace at 1603 Cherrybrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| Mr. Graham, and this is kind of following Larson Jay's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1403)|
| 0:23:29| and I just want to make sure I've got this clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| On the sector plan, Knox Planning wants you to do community commercial, but you want to do CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1413)|
| 0:23:43| Is that a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| Again, it's two actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| One is to amend the sector plan, which predominantly most of this property is already community commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| There's just a couple of parcels of it that are not community commercial at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| I thought that was reversed when I was looking at the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| That's the same thing as general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| Well, this is the plan, sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1445)|
| 0:24:07| That's just the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| We have not, the next item is on whether it should be CRPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| So it could be any commercial zone in the, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| I'm requesting CA for all the reasons I've mentioned to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| Versus PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| And like I said, at the end of the day, you know, we just, if I have planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| then I have to go reapply to MPC and to do anything further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| If Lowe's wants to expand, if Hobby Lobby wants to expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| I got to go through the plan, plan, use our view and, and, you know, it's effectively built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| That's, that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| Mr. Graham, thank you for calling me and going over this, explaining it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| Sometimes when things aren't in our district and we're not over there all the time, it's hard to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| but it makes complete sense what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| My issue is, and you made a great statement, that this is stormwater issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| This is some engineering issues and this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| However, for these people that have property that they've been paying property taxes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| and it's their property, we need to make sure we can see what we can do for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| So now that you've just found this out from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| that's something that you'd be willing to work with them and Director Snowden and his office on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| of seeing what we can look at and kind of what's going on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| Absolutely, and I did have my construction guy walk the site at 5 o'clock today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1542)|
| 0:25:50| and most of our, most all of our set fits is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| We have a couple of leaners, and we're the bypass pipe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| and a lot of this is coming from the Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| and through Chick-fil-A there's a main pipe that goes through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| but we've got riprap and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| but I've instructed him to go get truckload of hay bales and slow that water down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| until we can get the rest of the stormwater put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| So that's our intent, and again, I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| We've had a ton of rain, and I really think it will improve after we finish the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1585)|
| 0:26:34| or I know it will, or Jim will be all over me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| I don't think that you're trying to be a bad neighbor either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| but I definitely want the people that spoke, the two ladies, to know that we hear them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| and that is a major concern, and especially to me because we're dealing with some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| as Director Snowden knows, in my district with some flooding and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| So is that something, Director Snowden, that you and your office can start looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| and get the contact information for the two ladies that spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| Sure, and actually before the meeting I got a couple of their business cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| and certainly assured them that we're going to make sure that the design plans are reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| such that the flow rates aren't increased, that there's not erosive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| One of the things that we do in our ordinance is called downstream channel protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| which is above and beyond what some jurisdictions require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| which we make developers hold the one-year 24-hour storm in their pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| and release it over a 24-hour period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| That way you don't get that real erosive effect downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| So yeah, I've got a couple of their cards, and we'll work with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| to make sure that their concerns are taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you. I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you, girls, for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| I think you'll be very happy with Director Snowden and his offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| They're very, very attentive to what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| I just want to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| If they are planned commercial, they have to go through that process with your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| Please speak into the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Oh, I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| If they are planned commercial, there's the opportunity to do that, to get in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| If they're not, we are at the mercy of what they agree to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| And as a person who has suffered the consequences of what was unforeseen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1701)|
| 0:28:30| I would much rather we have the assurances that we can get ahead of those problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1710)|
| 0:28:36| before construction continues and our issues are exacerbated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| in ways that perhaps are not intended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| but if we have the opportunity for somebody who is an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| who can advocate for our needs in ways that we don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| I don't know about cubic feet per whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| I trust you all to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I will mention that you pointed out there are a number of jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| that are all piled up over here together, and it is complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| We are Knox County property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| We are Knox County taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| I do not pay taxes to this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| You are my people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| I rely on you to advocate for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| So please keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| And I'm pretty sure that's true about all of my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| And to some of my fellow commissioners' questions about community commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| the sector plan, what zonings are allowed in the urban growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| you've got PCE, SCCA, and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| And to that point, I guess my question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| why are you wanting to move away specifically from planned commercial to CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| Because you can do everything that you want to do with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| under the planned commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I know we're talking about sector plan right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| but then I have some additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I have been talking with Director Snowden because this is an area where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| flooding and stormwater issues have been prevalent since the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| We all know that I think Cherry Brook was built in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| At the time, there were no stormwater management standards in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| We've come a long, long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| Unfortunately and sadly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| you're still seeing the effect of not having any standards when your houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| There are also several blue line streams on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| And I'm just wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| does the county have any history of concerns or issues or complaints that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| were filed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| What records do we have that show any notice of violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| either before, during, or after construction of the existing area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| Have any violations or issues been found by county inspectors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Can we require an environmental impact study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| Is that something that potentially the applicant would be willing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| And property owners, do you have any proof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| any pictures of damaged property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Have you submitted those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| So those are really my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| And then also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| we've got one lot that is a part of the original covenant of Cherry Brook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| And I had reached out to our law department and asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| you know, do those covenants still stand despite what we decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| that's another layer that you would actually have to go back to the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| And I think by majority vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| they would have to rule on that number 15 lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| So I know that was a lot just kind of thrown out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| But if Director Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| if you'd like to start and ask those questions, Director Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| if you could tell me the benefits and the disadvantages of a PC versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1912)|
| 0:31:58| general, is there really a need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| is there one that we can substantiate with proof that would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| support a rezoning if it's not really necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| if the project can be done under planned commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| So I'm going to turn it over to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| And Mr. Graham, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| This is a really good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| I just, you have to understand too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| we really have to look at the issues that have been created by existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| how it's impacting residents who have lived and paid into our tax revenue for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| And we want to make this project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| We just want to do it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I can start a little bit there, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Yeah, we've in my tenure at the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| we went back and looked at our records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| We've never had any issues related to drainage concerns coming from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| Graham's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| We have had some notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1975)|
| 0:32:57| There's a car lot that's up on Clinton highway that we did have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| enforcement action against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| And subsequently us and them work together to install some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| piping to mitigate some of that downstream effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| To your point, Cherrybrook was developed before stormwater standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| So there's spillways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| There's not really detention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| but we've never had any issues with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Graham in related to the hydrology aspect of his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| We've never issued any of these to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| We did receive a complaint about some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| some sediment that had got off site upon review in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| his development, we didn't see any major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| There was something I think in that in the city section of his development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| that we did talk to let the city know that they could look into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| as far as the environmental impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| that's something that I don't think we have the purview necessarily to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| require. I think, you know, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Graham could do that if he wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| but as far as us being able to require that with our codes or ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| I'm not aware of any way in which we could, we could require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| But as commission, we could require it as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| I believe so. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| Director Welch, if you could speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| Currently the property is zoned substantially planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| It has developed successfully over the years as planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| My understanding from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Graham is that he's, he's been there and done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| he would prefer not to continue his development or the plans zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| As I think you're all aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| the plan zone allows for additional view by planning and engineering staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| TDOT to take a look at the proposed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| And it's consistent again with his already developed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| So it gives us to look at his landscaping plan, look at his access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| drainage, transportation, that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| So if those things that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| he's already gone through to build his successful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| So if that was not the case, it was under commercial just CA, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| and when it gets to that point, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| planning commission or the residents would not have another bite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| i.e. bite at the apple, another chance to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| So that's why staff felt it was important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| at least to be recommend approval of the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| And when it comes to the zoning rezoning application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| we recommended planned commercial again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| to try to adjust the concerns of the neighbors in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| as well as other other opportunities that we have to continue with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| successful development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Mr. Graham, would you like to speak to those questions, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| I don't know that that was a lot, but again, I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| I think the CA is warranted here for simplification. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| I just think we need, we we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| we've got a permit from the city of Knoxville, which is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| a challenge to get permits from the city. So we've got those permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| We've got our permit from the county, uh, T dot, et cetera. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| this is a zoning issue. This isn't a drainage issue. I, you know, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| here with some of the neighbors that live further back in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| not adjoining the property. Uh, and, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| certainly we'll address those. If, if we're responsible for anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| we'll address it. And we have to, whether it's CA or PC or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| anybody that grades their property is responsible for their water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| we have a licensed engineer that's been an engineer for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| It's been through the county. It's been through city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| So all those issues and drainage, it's not necessarily rocket science. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| the only thing I can think of is that we haven't finished the stormwater on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| the specific site up front. And once that's in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| it will be going through the detention pond. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| but as it sits now, as it was before we, uh, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| began our work, it was all going through the ditch that they're referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| So, um, we're not going to do anything that's in inappropriate. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| like I said, if y'all want me to go through playing commercial fun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| but I don't think it's really necessary in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| I think I've earned the right after 40 years of developing in this, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| uh, city and county. And, uh, uh, but you know, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| uh, whatever the, you know, commissioners want to do on this, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| I just, I just respectfully ask for CA zoning and, and, uh, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| the drainage is, we'll be taking care of whatever it may be. And we'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| you know, walk out there with Mr. Snowden if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| And I appreciate those comments and your commitment to, to quality, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| development. I really, really do. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2297)|
| 0:38:21| there's so many perspectives that we have to consider and one is precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Um, and you know, it was, I bring this up to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2305)|
| 0:38:31| Sometimes we've, we've had an applicant before talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| getting a sector plan amendment or approval for rezoning in a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| It's kind of like a marriage. And I jokingly said, yeah, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| and you've cheated on us before. Um, so I'm kind of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| I've now postured myself in that I want a prenup with anyone I go into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| relationship with, not because of, um, any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| anything that you have or have not done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| but just the nature of development and growth and all of the things that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| that we tend to be more reactive to versus proactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| And I hear you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| that you will do all the things that these residents have concerns about and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| you're willing to do PC. I just think that that safeguards us a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2359)|
| 0:39:25| Yes, sir. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| director will see director Welch. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| Do y'all look at drainage plans? Do we? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| Does MPC look at drainage as part of the development plan? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| You look at the drain, you look at, you actually dig into the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| Drainage is part of the review by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| It's part of the engineering though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Majority of it's done by either city or County engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| but it's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| I understand, but your staff or they're not, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2393)|
| 0:39:58| they're not drainage engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| I don't think that's the point, but correct. You're not saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| but I'm not sure where you're going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| I'm just, my point is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I don't think there's any difference in the submission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| whether you're in the city or County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| you're going to go through city or County engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| And from a plan standpoint, there's not going to be, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| any different that the planning staff will have about drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| They're going to yield to the respective city or County engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| departments. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| I don't think they do storm calculations or tell you how big your pipe should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| be or all that stuff. I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| Is that correct? You're correct in that comment. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| So the point is we're down to, should it be zone CA or PC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| That's, that's what you're down to. Should it be PC or CA? It's, it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| it's not, I'm not going to die one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Commissioner Jay. Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| I do think we ought to deal with the first thing first and the second thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| second. So right now we're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| all we're going to do is vote on the sector plan change and let's just focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| focus, focus. Cause otherwise we're going to be in the weeds and be here all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| night. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| I do want to ask one clarifying question of Ms. Brooks and Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| Wallace. Um, Ms. Wallace, Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| I see you live about halfway down Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| Oh, you live about halfway down Cherrybrook. Yes. And Ms. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| Wallace, you live all the way at the end of Cherrybrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| pretty close to Crossgate. We are at the culvert. It ends at our house. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| So you're at that ending zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| And is it your position that all things related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| trees, mud, you know, is you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| you believe it's coming from down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| New development, not because right behind you in this Valley is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| a fairly large pond and lots of other, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| there's lots of stuff that drains into this area. Are you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| are you sort of saying that all this new issue is from the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| The, the pace with which I won't say volume because that's like a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| the, the rapidity of the movement dramatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| dramatically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| I don't know if you can see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| but it's like a, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| the rapidity of the movement dramatically increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Ms. Brooks, please use the microphone. I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| You've got to sort of like get right in on it here. There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Okay. So, oh yeah, I hear a difference now. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| The rapidity with which the water is moving behind my property has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| dramatically increased since the changes that were made at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| neighborhood. Now, I don't know, again, I'm not an engineer, so I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| but one of the things that happened is a whole slot of trees were taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| down. I don't know if that has to do with the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| I don't know if you pulled the trees down to make the retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| I don't know how to solve these problems. I just know that if we put something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| in the, you know what, nevermind, that's the second thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| No, no, I, I understand. I guess I'm, I'm just looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| as I look into 3d maps, I look in online. I mean, there's, there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| there's lots of water that come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| You've got a fairly large pond just to what I believe is the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| You've got stuff coming down the other end of the Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| I mean, it's not just the one little spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| It's the whole Ridge comes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| That's why I was speaking to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| That's why I was speaking to you guys about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| I've grown up here and I've seen the progression with years of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| in unimaginable rain. I've seen it grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| I've, I've, I know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| that we are describing to you has only happened since this new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| started. Not prior to, it's not coming from Clinton highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| It's not coming from that off Chick-fil-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| It has nothing to do with the other ponds. This is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| It only started as that time. And with several of the elderly residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| in the neighborhood spoke with me today and they would love to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| but a lot of them are in their eighties and nineties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| And they wanted me to say that for them too. This is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| This is not something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| And I think you've heard the applicant say there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2647)|
| 0:44:10| like in every construction process, there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| you got to move a bunch of stuff and fix a bunch of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| And it's a process and he hasn't yet sort of directed everything into this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| part that whatever. So I get that there's a immediate action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| and there's a future fix. Obviously that's what stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| our stormwater team is, is awesome about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Even in existing issues that are totally not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| Sometimes a culvert blocks up or sometimes water just decides to go this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2675)|
| 0:44:39| versus that way. We've, we've been working on this at all. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| I don't understand what the different, why, if it's okay, that's why we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I think that's what she was trying to say is the PC would allow us more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| guarantee. It would just give us more assurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| And it's almost like, I guess, and I, you know, excuse my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| I guess, stupidity for lack of a better word on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| I don't understand the harm it would cause. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I think what the app, if I'm trying to interpret what I'm hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| just like I'm trying to interpret from you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| what I'm hearing is the applicant saying, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| I have to go through all of that stormwater stuff anyway to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| He's going to have to go work with engineering and stormwater and they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| going to hold him accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| He has to put real money into a pot and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| I'm going to do everything I'm supposed to do to make sure that it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| affect my neighbors per law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| I'm going to put my money up against it and I'm going to guarantee that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| going to do all that work. If you, I would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| because I've developed everything else in this area successfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| I'd like to go through a process that's a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| since I got to do it anyway, I'd like to go through door number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| which is a more streamlined approach to get it done faster in a really tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| economic and construction environment versus door two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| which is going to end up doing the exact same three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| but it requires two, three, four extra steps. Is that a fair act?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| Mr. Graham, is that a fair sort of recap of what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| So I think it's, you're going to all end up in the exact same spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| It's about, do you go through this process of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| And, and I would say like, again, I want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| I want to vote on the sector plan, which I do think is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2777)|
| 0:46:22| And then I want to get to the zoning, but I also have been here five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| and I've worked very closely with stormwater and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| And I disagree a little bit that like the penalties of some don't warrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2791)|
| 0:46:38| the punishment of others. And in five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| I've never once heard engineering say anything about stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| when it comes to the Graham Corporation, never in all the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| and all the permits and all the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| So I think you have a good partner at your, trust me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| we know the ones that are not good partners to communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| but I'm, I'm hesitant to sort of go down that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| of because some people don't do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| That means that nobody's going to do it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| And we've got to sort of add a bunch of layer of extra stuff to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| So let's worry about that second. I want to, I want to vote on the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| and then we'll kind of get back to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| But I just wanted to make sure I clarified both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| I completely understand your issue and I completely understand your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| So I appreciate the time to just explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you, Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| You made the statement that 85% of the property was already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| Could you clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| You said 80 to 85% is already developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| so if you look at the next to the last page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2875)|
| 0:48:01| I've outlined Lowe's Hobby Lobby and the future anchor pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| None of that's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| The,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| the drive is already around the anchor pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| and goes to the back of Lowe's and Hobby Lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| The only thing really we're doing in the center is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| where it's kind of a sharp angle on the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| This, we've never been able to get a third anchor here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| because the angle on the parking is very sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| and we can't get full depth parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| In front of the anchor store like a Dick's or an Academy or Kohl's or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| so that's really the only thing we're doing in the back is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| laying the curb back so we can get full depth parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| And then in the front, which is all, the buildings are all in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| They're in CH2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| There's not a plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| The buildings aren't going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| The only thing we have is a little bit of parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| and a drive to the back of the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| and that's really it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| And then behind where the green is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| that's where the new detention is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| So I have a little bit to the left of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| but it's behind the center and it's certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| very well buffered from Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| that's what, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| not to oversimplify it, but that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| but Lowe's, Hobby Lobby and the future anchor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| you know, that might be 90% of the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| It may be more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| And I know that you had a packet of letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| the neighbors, the immediate neighbors in blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| And weren't they the Cherrybrook neighbors that actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2992)|
| 0:49:57| backed up to all of your property here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| Yes, I've known some of those since we built Lowe's back in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| I just say that to say you have done your homework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| with the neighbors and tried to let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| not only what did happen, but what, what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| We met with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| after MPC met with Michelle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| and went over some of their,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| their main concerns that I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| and you correct me if I'm wrong, Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| was traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| a buffer, and drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| We spent a lot of time talking about drainage today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| But traffic, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| you can look back at the landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| and see there's no access from Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| And buffer, you can see the landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| and it'll be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| It has to be built for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And then, like I said, I don't want to rehash the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| I'm, you know, we've talked plenty about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| And again, it's not a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| drainage is an engineering stormwater issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| I will say this plan goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| especially in the landscape escaping part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| goes well beyond anything that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| That's the no city rent code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| ...ever, ever be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| So in some ways the county's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| at least getting the benefit of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| of, of that since that property is adjoined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3082)|
| 0:51:28| And I hear what you're saying, Mr. J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| about keeping, you know, the, the two separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| I'll just say this and, and I'll, I'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| But whoever said this is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| Mr. Graham is not one of the developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| that we typically have issues with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| And he has been in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| almost 40 years building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| And I do think his reputation should mean something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| He is a staple in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| He's, he's, he doesn't, he doesn't hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| He's very, he's very out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| and generous in his giving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| giving back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| And I think if you put that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| which to me addresses character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| on top of what we already know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| that he has been a very reputable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| commercial developer for years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| to, to try to give him a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| a little bit of relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| and not have to go through quite so many steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| especially given the fact that the whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| the whole thing is virtually developed anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I mean, there's, it's, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| There's almost nothing left there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| And this is going to be nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| but an improvement to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| I mean, it's pretty hodgepodgey looking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| We get this, this nice looking front in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| with that landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| I mean, that, that's a win for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| So I, I don't, I don't have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| supporting the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| or the, his request for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| Is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| Can you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| We've, we're just on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Can we get to the, the rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| and then you can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3203)|

| 0:53:39| but also if we could make it for the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| as he's requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3222)|

| 0:55:34| Yes, I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| My name is Michelle Guerin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| I live at 1613 Cherrybrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Ms. Guerin, can you hold on one second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| I'm going to have our planning director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| read us the Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| The Planning Commission recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| is approve the PC plan commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| because it is an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| of the zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| and requires development plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| and the highest quality site design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| by a vote of 12 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| Now, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Again, Michelle Guerin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| I live at 1613 Cherrybrook Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| So I actually live in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Ms. Brooks and Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| And like Mr. Graham had stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| I have met with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3380)|
| 0:56:22| and spoken with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3382)|
| 0:56:24| prior to this meeting, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| That doesn't mean that I don't have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| and I am requesting also PC for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| I know the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| has already been voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| but for this next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| And the reason why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| is because it is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| I also have four trees that died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| These are trees that have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| I've lived here for over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| in my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| I've known all my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| I've got neighbors that live next to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| that are in their 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| that couldn't make it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| because of their age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| And I see this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| It's a beautiful community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| And I think Tim has the greatest intentions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| but we have to be protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| because we do have issues now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| We have water that is rushing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| And what has surprised me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| is I just heard him say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| that most of the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| is going into the ditch right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| because I was assured that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| the water was being diverted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| to his detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| by Shane and Sane today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| And apparently that's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| And when he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| when all of the excavation was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| back in 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| that's when the water started flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Not just normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Like just Ms. Wallace stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| she's been here over 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| been here 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| and I've never seen it get to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| You can't even stand in your yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| It's rushing so fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| I have videos of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| even on Mr. Graham's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3473)|
| 0:57:55| that he recently bought in Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| I also own a condo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| in the Cherrybrook condos in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| So this is a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| mixed with not just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| you've got about 62 homes in Cherrybrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| and then there's another 57 condos in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| I manage them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| and I also own another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| So I have two properties in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| that the entrance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| and water that runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| in the stream in the back of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| that runs all the way through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| crosses under a cross gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| and goes to the back of the property of the condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| I have to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| That's a private community back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| has private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| So I'm dealing with a detention pond back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| a builder who did not do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| what they needed to do at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| Now, because it's private,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| I was told they couldn't handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| I want to make sure that that doesn't happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| with this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| and it's not anything personal against Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| I think he's been very great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| he's been very courteous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| and I'm sure he has every intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| But we have owners who are going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| 57 owners right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| just in the condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| who are going through the same drainage issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| and promises for these detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| and landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| and it's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| And so now you've got fears and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| about Mr. Graham's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| I think it would be a great addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| I really do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| because it doesn't look great now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| But the biggest thing that I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| is when they raised all of the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| and it was nothing but mud and guck there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| that's when the water started flowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| There's not grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| there's not foliage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| there's not trees to grab all that water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| And that's why I'm seeing that come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| I've never had it come up to my pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| It covered two feet above my pump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| and my pool is close to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| So it's very concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| I had four trees die last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| These are trees that have been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| before I moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Trees that are well over 40 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| My neighbors have been there since the 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| both of them, on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| And they've told me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| you know, they're upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| because all the trees that are bordering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| this little creek that runs behind my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| are dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| And I don't know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| We've tried to plant plants back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Something is causing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| all this water is causing them to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| And I know people say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| well, we've had a lot of rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| We've had flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| major flooding in Powell years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| It did nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| It barely came into my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| And I really believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| when you take all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| when you take the foliage down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| when you remove these trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| and you've got nothing but mud and concrete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| it's gushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| You just have to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| I mean, now, any day when it rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| it really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I even sent Mr. Gramma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| the video of his backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| and the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| so he can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| And we want to work with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| but we want to make assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| that things get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| And that is a big concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| when we've already had 57 owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| back in the condos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| dealing with an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| because the detention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| was done prior to 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| you know, and because it's private roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| We don't want that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| So, I mean, that's, you know, that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3687)|
| 1:01:33| I mean, that's pretty much what I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Mr. Gramm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| When I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| If you look at the landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| what I was referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| is the storm pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| for the developed front part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| has not been installed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Nevertheless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| you know, there was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| When we got the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| I think it was family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| and then to the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| is a vacated...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| It's not been disturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| So, nevertheless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| all this has always been draining to the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| We've not increased anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| from what's going in the ditch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| before or after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| The Copeland tops over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| it's still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| We've not done any work there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| And so, to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| where the other building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| that was a family homes with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| But this will all be draining to the pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| once we get our storm water in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| once we get our final permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| on the drainage that goes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| And I don't have that plan with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| but again, that's reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| by the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| So, all the drainage will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| to our new pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| that's twice as big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| as the one that was there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| So, just a point of clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Mr. Gramm, so all the drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| from the new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| will be draining into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| the retention pond, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| For the two buildings up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| all that will go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| That actually will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| as it was before we started the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| all that's going to the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Now, because we're putting pavement in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| and new buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| it will go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| the detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| So, as a builder and developer myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| I've got a little more experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| working with my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| on these types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| It's not going to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| All your guys' concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| are very, very valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| But whether it's Zone CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| or CB or whatever the other one was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Yeah, PC, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| It's not going to change the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| It has absolutely zero to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| with the drainage at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| What's going to fix your drainage issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| is going to be that retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| It's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Actually, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| nothing's connected into that pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| Right now, everything is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| diverted at one drain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| If there's less vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| that water moves more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| During development, it's all moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| a little bit more quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| I'm sure the flow is even greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Also, we were having the wettest years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| on record the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| The best thing to have happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| to fix all these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| is to finish the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| to direct all that water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| Instead of going to that massive drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| it's going to go all into the retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| As engineering has said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| that retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| has a lot more restriction on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| How the retention pond functions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| has a lot more restrictions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| As we have these massive downpours of rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| he has to collect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| and he cannot release it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| It has to be released slower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| over a longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| It can't just all be diverted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| to what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| The thing that's going to solve the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| is going to be the retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3911)|
| 1:05:13| Completing that retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| and connecting all that together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| is what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| He's already working on the city stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| This is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| I know there's a lot of jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| and it gets very confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| but this isn't going to affect that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Mr. Graham keeps going back to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| where this is a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| and he's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| This is really a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| and really what we're going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| is what path to put him down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| is best for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| One of the things with this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I know Mr. Graham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| but we had a conversation about this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| in detail the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| and I appreciate you reaching out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| I'm sure you reached out to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| as you typically do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| but his track record over 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| I think, has been pretty outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| He doesn't ever screw anybody over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| or not do what he says he's going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| so as somebody with experience in this field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| the only solving of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| is going to be the drainage retention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| because if we give him CA or CB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| it's still going to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| It's the exact same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| and the only kind of restriction would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| with the greenery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| but the greenery falls in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| so he has to do the greenery anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| We came and touched that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| It's not going to mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| the water mitigation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| It's still going to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| so it's kind of a mute argument, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| but that is my personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| and Mr. Graham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| I appreciate the work you've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| and I'm sure you'll do right by these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| as you've done historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| Can I follow up with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Can I follow up with this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| I'm going to hear from the other commissioners first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Commissioner Ward made a lot of the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| that I was going to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| a lot better than I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| because of his expertise in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| and listen, I do want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| there's not a commissioner sitting up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| that does not care about the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| and the drainage and the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| stormwater issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| because we all have areas in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| developments in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| that deal with these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| But the point I want to emphasize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| and Commissioner Ward said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| but I want to hear Mr. Snowden say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Mr. Snowden, of the two zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| that are essentially being considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| the PC, which was recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| by the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| and the CA that's being requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| by the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| would which one of those zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| is ultimately determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| have any effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| on what your office would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| in terms of drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| and stormwater measures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| From the stormwater ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| what we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| is impervious surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| What's the pre and post flows off the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| So, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| I don't foresee any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| that I can think of in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| that the PC zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| would change the end result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| of the design calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| versus the PC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| the CA versus the PC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| That's a great segue into my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Staff recommended PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| and then Planning Commission recommended PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| to ensure the highest quality site design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| by a vote of 12 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| So, during those conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| why didn't the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| and Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| have discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| the general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| if that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| I mean, there was an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| for him to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| for that zone, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| And to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| The applicant did request it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| and he did make a presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| to the Planning Commission for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| I can't recall the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| but after the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| presentation by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| and the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| decided on PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4173)|

| 1:10:04| some of my colleagues feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4204)|

| 1:10:10| And yes, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| But had we upheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4213)|

| 1:10:18| for many of those other cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| that didn't turn out so well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| we wouldn't be having to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4223)|

| 1:11:36| and I've not heard one negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| across builders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4300)|

| 1:11:44| And he's not going anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| He's in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4306)|

| 1:11:51| that this commission should hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4311)|

| 1:12:10| an opportunity to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| once you brought to the next issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| So I'm just going to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| to please do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4335)|

| 1:12:25| was that it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| about the drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| We also have concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| because I know that see a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| there is not a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4352)|

| 1:13:23| to have that protection again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| This is a long standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| community that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4406)|

| 1:13:28| And that's all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| That's that's what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| asking is that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4410)|

| 1:13:36| And if he's OK with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| he even said it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| matter one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| I mean, it's already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| two years that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4421)|

| 1:14:42| what this is and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| just tell us about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| dimensions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| It's very small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| landscape plan that is now required by most of this in the city, and some of the lot is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4490)|
| 1:15:00| already zoned CA, and then a little bit in the back is the plant RB, I believe, RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4500)|
| 1:15:08| But the green is your land, as you can see, and there's trees all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4508)|
| 1:15:16| There weren't any trees along this, along either of these lot lines, along the Cherrybrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| Road or along the first house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| Trees mostly were along the ditch that's in the very back, but I don't believe we've removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| any trees along the second lot there or Cherrybrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| And so then the rest of it, I can't really tell you, Commissioner, all the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| There's so much in there that's required by recode that it's going to be a beautiful project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| and it's going to cost a lot of money, and I really believe that at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| you know, I've heard the concerns, and I will address every one of them as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4562)|
| 1:16:11| But did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| You can see the trees in the buffer behind, or under the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| It's all down the whole side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| And the retention pond is in the center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Is the retention pond in the center, or is the retention pond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| No, the retention pond's way back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| It's way in the back, and it has a water quality unit, also, that will filter the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| Okay, so this is, that circular thing is not an additional, like, indentional pond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| On this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4600)|

| 1:16:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4605)|

| 1:16:56| I would like to clarify one of the lady's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4616)|
| 1:17:11| The supplemental regulations of the Noss County Zoning Ordinance, Section 14, does give my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| department the ability to require landscape screening on any zone, as it abuts commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| So in the case of, like, the lot that I think the lady was talking about, which is 1825,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4645)|
| 1:17:32| the lot adjacent to it, 1829, which would, in this condition, be rezoned CA, if approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4652)|
| 1:17:39| as such, my department would require a type A landscape barrier along that front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4659)|
| 1:17:45| So even if it doesn't, you know, regardless of what this body chooses to do, there will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| be some landscape requirements, as defined in Section 4.10 of the Noss County Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=4670)|

| 1:28:55| We've got some of the folks here that are able to speak more to that, but I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| that's more appropriate to be discussed upon a use on review later on after we get past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5341)|

| 1:29:27| some ground maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5367)|

| 1:29:55| got this exact same zoning that we are requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| The planning commission determined that this is consistent with the area that the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5399)|

| 1:30:22| I'll defer to the district commissioner if he wants to start, but I'm happy to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5422)|
| 1:30:30| I'll yield to Commissioner Jay first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| I'll make my comments before my motion when I'm prepared to make one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| I just put my light on because I was thinking and I just wanted to get it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| Thank you for the information presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| I think maybe one commissioner, I'm looking at you Commissioner Schoonmaker, might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| been here when almost anything that had to do with Midway came before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5456)|
| 1:31:04| And so ten of us obviously have learned, whether it be six months or almost six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5464)|
| 1:31:14| all the things that went into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| So we're unfortunately at a little bit of a disadvantage in that we're trying to better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| understand it, but we weren't part of making decisions X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| With all due respect to any company that wants to build and bring commerce of any kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5485)|
| 1:31:34| I don't want to get into the type and the actual what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| I think that's a completely separate discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| I just got to say that I have virtually no appetite for anything in this area until Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5501)|
| 1:31:49| is figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Midway is, Midway will be full with something one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5511)|
| 1:31:58| It will be developed with something one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| I have sat on the development core board and understand it and understand kind of how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| got here and jobs and commerce and something will happen to fill that infrastructure and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| that investment that has been made in some way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| I don't know what that will look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| I don't know what will come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| I mean, if you'd asked us a year and a half or two years ago, it might have been a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| discussion, but the world changes so quickly and I'm not sure what that will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| But someday something will happen, but I just, when it comes to this, whether it's your company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| any other development, I just have very little appetite for adding anything else until there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| something that was there that was promised to the community that did put a lot of emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5561)|
| 1:32:48| into thought and plans and we can't, in my opinion, I'm not interested in improving anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5568)|
| 1:32:58| additional until we figure out the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| So I'm respectfully going to not support this and down the road, I think we have some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| things coming around that I just can't support either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| But I do hope we figure out what that looks like and what will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5591)|
| 1:33:16| It has been a major emphasis of infrastructure and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5596)|
| 1:33:22| However we got there, it is what it is and hopefully one day that will bring prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| jobs, housing, other opportunities, but we'll have to cross that bridge when it comes, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5608)|
| 1:33:37| I won't be supporting anything in that area just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| Thank you, Commissioner Jay, for remembering that I started in 2015, so yes, I was present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5627)|
| 1:33:53| for all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| Your predecessors that sat in each one of these chairs went through a very trying time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5637)|
| 1:34:03| back in 2015 to really figure out what we needed to do with the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5643)|
| 1:34:10| The public was against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| I have to give credit to County Mayor Tim Burchett because he expended a lot of political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5653)|
| 1:34:22| capital to make that Midway Business Park happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| He made commitments to the community and those commitments need to be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5668)|
| 1:34:35| Everybody that sat in your seat upheld the commitments that we made to that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5675)|
| 1:34:42| out there, and to say that this is some relevancy to a basketball tournament, that just really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| makes my blood boil because if everybody from the County Mayor, I mean, he could have just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| blown this off and gone on, but he made it part of his mission to see what he needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5695)|
| 1:35:02| to do to get the community and the county to come together to make Midway happen, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| so I'm going to definitely be voting no on both these items, and I hope you'll do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| I agree with Commissioner Larson and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| I'll put my legal hat on, and I say the commitments are a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| So I think the county has made a commitment to these people and they have a contract and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| they have a duty to fulfill that contract, so I will be voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5735)|
| 1:35:45| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| I guess I'm going to reiterate what my fellow Commissioner said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| I want to thank Ms. Cole for standing up and giving us a little bit of history also on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| When we go into a commitment as a legislative body, it's our responsibility, whether we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5756)|
| 1:36:03| still sitting here or whether we're not still sitting here, to uphold that, and I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| with Commissioner Schoonmaker, so this isn't something that I'll be able to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5767)|
| 1:36:15| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| Commissioner Buehler, would you remind me again, would you remind me again, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5779)|
| 1:36:25| Buehler, why, or do we even know why this outfit is not sitting in our industrial park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5785)|
| 1:36:35| out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| I might defer to their representative, Mr. McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| You may know the answer to that, but my understanding is that it was not deemed an appropriate tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5802)|
| 1:36:50| for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| I may be wrong, I apologize, if I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| The question was asked is why this applicant is not a tenant in the business park as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5817)|
| 1:37:03| exists now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| I know Commissioner Durrett and I, sorry, I'll yield to Commissioner Jay, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5827)|
| 1:37:14| We both sat on the Development Court Board, and I can tell you that my understanding was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| that the types of businesses that were intended to go into that area required a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5838)|
| 1:37:27| of jobs and a certain amount of income and a certain amount of type of business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| would have warranted the initial investment to begin with, and a company like this with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5852)|
| 1:37:39| so few employees would not fit that model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Is that accurate, Chairwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| Yes, from my recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| Yes, that's what I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Well, I think I can say that we actually approached the business park to acquire property there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| and there was absolutely no interest, so I'm not sure exactly what that was, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| that I've read that there may be investors or others that want to acquire the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| business park, and so that's probably one of the reasons that we were not able to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| any interest in selling us anything, and there is that they want to have the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| thing able to be sold later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| Perhaps there are in discussions that we're unaware of, but again, I don't think ceasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5904)|
| 1:38:34| any investment in the area is the answer to the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5914)|
| 1:38:43| With that large business park that sits there, I mean, we're talking about one piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5923)|
| 1:38:51| that once again, there is EC zone property right across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| This is not like that this would be the only EC zone property that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| It's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5943)|

| 1:39:06| We're talking about one particular piece of property, and there has been an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5951)|

| 1:39:25| that taxpayer dollars have made can begin to be repaid because right now, there's absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5965)|
| 1:39:31| nothing, and I don't know what starts that rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| I don't know what the initiative needs to be, but saying that we're doing absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5977)|
| 1:39:46| nothing, I do not think would be the responsible thing to do to try to get some return on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| investment, and so I would ask the commissioners to please consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=5992)|
| 1:40:00| This was approved 12-0 by the planning commission, and they looked at it long and hard, and like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6000)|
| 1:40:10| I said, we did talk to local leaders, we talked to the law department, we looked at a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6010)|
| 1:40:20| of places in this county, and this fits all of those needs including, as I said, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| got the accessibility for the TVA power, which is right there, and I'm happy to answer any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6027)|

| 1:40:42| We weren't really aware of the questions that we might be receiving, but if you have any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| then they will certainly make themselves available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I want to take the opportunity to thank my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| for all of your comments, and to really hit home what my fellow Commissioner Lee said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| that citizens of Knox County, they see these plans as contracts, even though they may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6066)|
| 1:41:16| advisory, they are promises made to communities, and it's our responsibility to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| we uphold those commitments, so I will not be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6083)|
| 1:41:35| My second point is I'm really not sure how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| I'm very perplexed by Planning Commission's action on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6100)|
| 1:41:48| I don't know how we got here, and that's a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6108)|
| 1:41:55| To the Attorney's point, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| This can't be solved here tonight, but this is something that Knox County is taking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| consideration with our Advanced Knox Initiative, and we will be looking at the allowed uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| in that Midway Business Park so that we can rectify this situation, because even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6130)|
| 1:42:17| it is EC, it does have conditions as well, and so I want to thank the community for coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6137)|
| 1:42:24| out too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6144)|

| 1:42:34| Commissions meetings that I attended, I was speaking on behalf of my community, and she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6154)|
| 1:42:42| came down from her seat and found me and thanked me as a citizen for coming and being prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6162)|
| 1:42:51| and being unemotional and keeping things very fact, and that's what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| These are just facts, so thank you all for standing up and being the voice of your community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6176)|
| 1:43:03| and I support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6183)|
| 1:43:11| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| Seeing none, I will refer to the District Commissioner, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| Thank you, Madam Chair, and I just want to give a huge shout out thanks to everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6198)|
| 1:43:25| who showed up tonight from East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Thank you, Mr. Finney, and thank you to Laura Cole for your words, and to my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6208)|
| 1:43:36| for really listening to the people of East Knox County, and, you know, this has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6216)|
| 1:43:44| a long, this was, was a really long fight over this business park, and as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6224)|
| 1:43:53| the community did not just lay down and give up once the park was approved and the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6233)|
| 1:43:58| put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| They've not just gone home and forgotten about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| They're still here, and I will say, you know, to Mr. McDonald's point that he made early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| on, I'm glad we didn't get down into the weeds of, you know, potential intended uses and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6249)|
| 1:44:16| is it going to be allowed or is it not going to be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| I think we're sticking to the issue at hand in the discussion, and, you know, as my colleague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6258)|
| 1:44:25| in seat 11 pointed out, the planning staff and the planning commission make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6265)|
| 1:44:33| to this body, but this body is charged with making a legislative act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| Mr. Moyers reminds us of that frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| This is a legislative act, zoning, and, you know, when you're making recommendations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6282)|
| 1:44:49| as planning staff, planning commission, you're following certain criteria and plans and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| forth, and then you're making a recommendation to this body, but when it comes down to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| legislative act, you have to consider all that, but you also have to consider about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| what's happening in real life on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| You know, it's kind of like the weatherman that looks at the computer models and tells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| you it's not going to rain versus the one that looks out the window and sees that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| raining, and I think it's raining in East Knox County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| We can look out the window and see an empty business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| And so the notion that I see here on the recommendation of the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| that it is a minor extension at an existing business park, I would say it is a proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6330)|
| 1:45:38| extension of a nonexistent business park that is sitting empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6338)|
| 1:45:45| And so for that reason alone, this just is not a logical zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| Yeah, however many years ago, eight years ago, this was zoned business park, it hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6352)|
| 1:46:00| worked. Maybe someday there'll be something there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| but to extend the thing before anything's even in it would be a violation of so many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6362)|
| 1:46:10| principles that we should use, I think, as a body charged with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| So my motion on this is to deny the sector plan amendment as it was recommended by planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6376)|
| 1:46:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6387)|
| 1:46:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6388)|
| 1:46:29| I'm going to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| Motion on the floor is to deny the sector plan amendment by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6394)|
| 1:46:46| With a second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| Seeing none, motion on the floor to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| Point of order, is the next item even possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6432)|
| 1:47:26| It is. I mean, yes, you could. It would be probably overturned if somebody challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| it in court, but I do think you need to read it into the record and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6453)|

| 1:48:31| Approve the E.C. Employment Center zone because it is a minor extension of existing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6511)|
| 1:48:35| park and is consistent with the sector plan by a vote of 12-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| Thank you, Madam Chair. Director Welch, would this rezoning request be appropriate in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| sector plan as it exists now, prior to having been denied what they requested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| The zoning they're requesting, E.C.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6539)|
| 1:49:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Is it appropriate in the sector plan as it exists now, since we denied their request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| for an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| I don't believe so. No, otherwise we wouldn't be having a sector plan amendment, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| Okay. Then I will make a motion to deny this rezoning to E.C. because it is inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| with the existing sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=6559)|

| 1:59:30| It needs to be delayed so that it can be a part of the review of advanced NOGs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7170)|
| 1:59:38| as they go about their business reviewing all these ordinances and all these zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| And it's, again, not because I have any major issue with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| but I just felt like, after hearing from people that knew a little more than I did about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7190)|
| 1:59:56| that we might be wise to defer this until Advanced NOGs has a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| to make it a part of their review of all of the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7202)|
| 2:00:09| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| I think that we ought to vote this in because I had the same discussion with Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| and between now and the time we do the Advanced NOGs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| there could be applications presented, and we have a guide to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| If anything changes in the Advanced NOGs, it can be handled at commission when we approve Advanced NOGs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7228)|
| 2:00:35| So I suggest that we go ahead and approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| This is part of the alcohol waste study, and it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7238)|
| 2:00:42| There's no harm in it approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| If there's any changes, it can be made at Advanced NOGs when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| So I will be voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7251)|
| 2:01:00| Is there any more discussion right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7264)|
| 2:01:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7266)|
| 2:01:10| Motion to approve by Commissioner Daly with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7275)|
| 2:01:17| I would like to delay it until we can have Ms. Brooks here to speak about it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| I don't see why waiting 30 days at least would harm anything personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7282)|
| 2:01:30| Because I had the same conversation, and I thought this was going to be postponed as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7290)|
| 2:01:35| because it wasn't ready the way it's packaged now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| Director Welch, you're looking a tad confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7298)|
| 2:01:46| I couldn't quite hear what Commissioner Warren indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| but besides postponing it for 30 days, I heard that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| From my understanding, this wasn't ironed out all the way and wasn't time-sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| I mean, it was vetted through the fall of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7319)|
| 2:02:05| We postponed it from Planning Commission one time for further review by Engineering and Codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7325)|
| 2:02:12| and then it came through Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| There's no public comment that was given at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7335)|
| 2:02:23| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| It just seems like a really late request for delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7347)|
| 2:02:32| I've not heard anything about this, any reason not to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7352)|
| 2:02:38| And it seems like Director Welch is unaware of anything as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7358)|
| 2:02:44| I mean, I understand that 30 days is maybe not the end of the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| but I agree with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7369)|
| 2:02:53| I mean, the ordinance can be amended if it needs to down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7373)|
| 2:02:57| I'll yield if Commissioner Hill has more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7377)|
| 2:03:01| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| I, too, felt that same way initially when I was approached with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| And I think there, not that it hasn't been noticed and everything that it should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| but I think that there's just some overall concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7393)|
| 2:03:20| we just want to make sure everything fits and works correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7400)|
| 2:03:26| And I'm not certain of the sense of urgency, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7406)|
| 2:03:32| I know I spoke, and Jim, I hate to put you on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| but I know I spoke briefly with you about this and would appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7415)|
| 2:03:39| if you wouldn't mind sharing your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7419)|
| 2:03:42| Sure. Yeah, there was some of the folks that had approached, I guess, myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| and I think maybe some of this body, about some of the, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7426)|
| 2:03:51| some of the things that this ordinance codifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7431)|
| 2:03:54| that we consider uses by right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7434)|
| 2:03:57| they will become uses on review and may not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7437)|
| 2:04:00| I can't remember, I think there are uses on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7440)|
| 2:04:03| I don't believe there's any restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| but that individual or those individuals felt like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| there could be some, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| the diminishing of value of their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| if you've got a CA zone or CB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| So I think that was the concern that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| So in reference to that, I'd reached out to Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| which at the time of this ordinance had departed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7466)|
| 2:04:30| and Jeff, I can't remember exactly where Jeff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| if Jeff had been appointed the executive director or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| So there was a general thought that if this body wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| pause that process and do it as part of the overall zoning code update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7479)|
| 2:04:44| we could do, but certainly we'll defer to this body's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7484)|
| 2:04:48| It's just that we just wanted to provide options based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| some of the concerns that we had heard from some of the landowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7491)|
| 2:04:55| And thank you for that, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7495)|
| 2:05:00| And a lot of it did actually, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| have having to do with not recognizing how many pieces of spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7504)|
| 2:05:12| almost CA zoning that we have from one end of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| to the other that could, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7516)|
| 2:05:20| be financially impacted if this were to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| So when I heard that, I thought it might, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| be worth another look-see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| So that's why I'm bringing it to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7541)|
| 2:05:43| Mr. Murphy's in the audience, and he's followed this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| including going to the NOx planning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7548)|
| 2:05:50| So I'd like to give him two minutes to give his opinion if we should move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| Mr. Murphy, if you would please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7562)|
| 2:06:06| I'm not familiar with what the objection was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| but I think what I'm hearing is that some landowners are seeing that a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| uses, in some cases you may, I think in the CA zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7574)|
| 2:06:18| particularly for drive-throughs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| you may lose the ability to do a drive-through by right or even as a use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| on review if you're on a really small street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| And then in other cases it will become a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| And my take here is you're probably encountering what happens when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| county starts to examine what happens in those zones and decides that we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| to raise our bar for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7598)|
| 2:06:40| We want to have a little bit higher standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7600)|
| 2:06:42| So I'm going to suspect that that's the conversation that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| I do know it was on the agenda for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| It was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| I know that Michelle Portier spent a really long time on the crafting of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7613)|
| 2:06:58| standards in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| And one thing this does is it also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| while it maybe takes a little bit of drive-through away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| it also adds a lot of multifamily residential uses as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| So it might be taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| if you're on a small street in a CA zone and you want a drive-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| that might not be allowed if you're on like a minor collector or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7635)|
| 2:07:20| But you get the addition now, some new multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7640)|
| 2:07:23| So there's a little bit of maybe there's some give and take in some cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| But for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| I think most of the CA zone stuff sits on streets that would be allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7648)|
| 2:07:34| do a drive-through as a use by not use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| Thank you, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| Just quickly, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7664)|
| 2:07:46| And I certainly do not mean to indicate that I have objection overall with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7672)|
| 2:07:54| I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7674)|
| 2:07:55| I'm just thinking since we have invested so much time and energy in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7675)|
| 2:08:00| and this new advanced knocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| and this is exactly what will be happening this summer anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7683)|
| 2:08:08| that it might be a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| And they may look at it and think it looks absolutely fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| But I just think with our changes that are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7695)|
| 2:08:17| there might be some wisdom in just delaying so that it all kind of can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7697)|
| 2:08:22| happen altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| But my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| Thank you, Madam chair, commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| So you're, you're just unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| You're, you're not asking for like, we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| somebody has very specific changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| We'd like to make those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7724)|
| 2:08:46| Here's a red line copy, but we need 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| You're saying we don't know what the specificity of the changes may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| You just want to punt it down until advanced knocks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| which still could be six, eight, 10 months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7739)|
| 2:09:10| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| I don't, I'm not sure I have a strong opinion either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| I think we've noticed it and gone through it and we've been working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| since September and to stop it at the zero hour when it could be tweaked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| I agree with commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| but I also understand we're right in the middle of a big process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| So I don't, I don't know if I have a strong opinion either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| I just wish there was some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| I wish it was presented of here are some things that are concerning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7773)|
| 2:09:37| here's a red line version that we want you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| So you have something to take an action on versus six months of work is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| sort of, eh, we're not really sure that that's the hard part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| I wish I had something concrete to take an action on when it comes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| actual ordinance to what problem are we trying to solve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| That isn't solved in the ordinance right now. So I think that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| that's why I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| And actually Mr. Stone did hit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| Someone had talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| The CA is that we have all throughout this County places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| You'd never even dream of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| In fact, a pinch potentially could impact the value of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| I'm looking at my colleagues straight across here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7818)|
| 2:10:20| I'm willing to make a substitute motion to postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7820)|
| 2:10:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| My, the biggest thing that I was hearing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| is the property value thing. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| And the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| I don't think there's an obvious answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| I think that the appropriate way to do it would be to roll it in with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| all the rezoning that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| And that's got a lot more higher view because we do our Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7846)|
| 2:10:50| planning rezone stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| It's going to be all over the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| It's going to all come down at once instead of doing it now where people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7854)|
| 2:10:57| aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7857)|
| 2:10:58| Everybody knows their property is going to change value at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7858)|
| 2:11:00| The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7860)|
| 2:11:03| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7866)|
| 2:11:09| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| The change value at that point to do it at this point was kind of the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| And I had probably 10 people call me about devaluing their land that now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7876)|
| 2:11:24| they can't sell for certain purposes. So that was the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7884)|
| 2:11:28| so the conversations I had were, yeah, we can, we should push this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| It's not, it should be rolled in with everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7891)|
| 2:11:33| was getting from all this. Okay. Okay, so you, a specific postponement you don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7893)|
| 2:11:40| would be? I would think to give it, I would roll it into the big rollout of everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7900)|
| 2:11:48| so we could postpone it 90 days or 30 days and see if we can have more conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7908)|
| 2:11:54| with everybody, but at the same time it's, you know. I mean, I guess I'm just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| how extensively is it going to need to be changed? I mean, I can't imagine that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| going to be, need to be completely overhauled. Surely we can identify the things that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| harm a property owner in 60 days. Sure, we can do 60 days then, that's fine. I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| be here next month, so if we can do 60 days, I'd appreciate it. You said 30 and 90, I figured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7934)|
| 2:12:20| I'd hit right in the middle. Perfect. Hey, for what it's worth, I'll offer a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230327-zoning?start=7940)|
