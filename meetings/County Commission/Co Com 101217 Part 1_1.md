| 2:14:07| they complete the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| I mean if they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8049)|
| 2:14:11| renovate I mean right now they're drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| zero on the ground floor for rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| they're going to be drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| $50,000 a year in rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| that'll really get your surplus back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| if we're worried about surplus funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| as much as I support drug court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| I'm bothered that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| giving somebody money on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| provisional overages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| and that bothers me I think that we should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:39| they should have got a contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| with a solid plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8085)|
| 2:14:47| it's just a bad way to do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| it's giving away the government's money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| to a private organization when we're going to be giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8091)|
| 2:14:53| $50,000 a year when they're getting zero for it anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| so I'm going to support it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| I think it's the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| but I think that next time we enter negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| I don't think we ought to do it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Commissioner Burroughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| Judge Bumgarner I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| say how impressed and how proud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| I am to have this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| this program in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| it is successful and it saves lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| and it saves families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| excited that you have an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| upgrade your space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| to more space which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| I think necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| I do share Brad's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8131)|
| 2:15:33| do they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| bids already from contractors for this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8137)|
| 2:15:39| a contractor I have met with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| I can't call his name today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| as we sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8143)|

| 2:15:47| Bob Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| this is Mr. McNish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| who is the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| of Midway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8153)|
| 2:15:55| and this is Ms. McCarthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8155)|
| 2:15:57| who is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| the director of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:01| East Tennessee Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8161)|
| 2:16:03| Probation and Parole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8163)|
| 2:16:05| she sits on both their board and our board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8165)|
| 2:16:07| and that was another mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| another item that Mr. Jarrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| mentioned that there was a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| conflict of interest there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| this is what Ms. McCarthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:17| does for her life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8177)|
| 2:16:19| with people who are out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| on probation there is full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| disclosure to both boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| that she is on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| and I don't believe that anybody feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8187)|
| 2:16:29| there is any conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8189)|
| 2:16:31| regarding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8191)|
| 2:16:33| we have met with Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8193)|
| 2:16:35| Lambert we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8195)|
| 2:16:37| architectural plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| has been completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| Mr. Lambert to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| is a very impressive fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| he works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| with ex-prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| puts up with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| nonsense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| he has looked at this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| he has given this bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| he has an excellent reputation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| like anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| you can't guarantee it but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| I am very comfortable with the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| we have dealt with so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8231)|
| 2:17:13| Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8233)|
| 2:17:15| if I accurately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| describe the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8241)|
| 2:17:23| to the two of you also for your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| would there be any benefit to postponing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| this for 30 days so that we could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| at a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8251)|
| 2:17:33| to satisfy everyone's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8253)|
| 2:17:35| and still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| make this happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:39| at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| favor of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| I know you would like to get started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| as soon as possible but do you have an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| date for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| we can provide these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| funds we can't move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| I am just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| reminded about what happened with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| senior homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| I can't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:09| the name now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| when we had the contract with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8293)|
| 2:18:15| we just sold them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| Hillcrest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| we had said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| we would pay up to a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| amount and that is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| saying that is what we are going to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| because if they know you are going to pay up to that amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| they are not going to settle for anything less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| Mr. Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| from the 9th district pointed that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8315)|
| 2:18:37| and he was absolutely right about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| and I think this could be a similar situation where if the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| they know the money is available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| it would make it really easy to go over budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| not intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8325)|
| 2:18:47| but it is a safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| so I would like to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| that we postpone this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| and just see if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| work on an agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| satisfies everyone's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8339)|
| 2:19:01| but still makes it possible to put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| in a safe space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| substitute motion is to defer for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| is there a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| is there a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| I'll second just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8351)|
| 2:19:13| purpose of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8355)|
| 2:19:17| Commissioner Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| I was trying to get your attention Amy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8359)|
| 2:19:21| before you made the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| I would like to ask the question of Judge Bumgarner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| maybe it might negate having to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| Judge is it possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| you say they are going to spend their 90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| well what they've come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| to us with is saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| we will go forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:39| if you can contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| to us 20,000 dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8383)|
| 2:19:45| after months and months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| and months of negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| that's what it's come down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| and the reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| for it is that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| concerned and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8395)|
| 2:19:57| they're going to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8397)|
| 2:19:59| all their funds and literally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8399)|
| 2:20:01| not have anything left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| this 90,000 dollars that they got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| for the sale of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8409)|
| 2:20:11| that Commissioner Andrews brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8411)|
| 2:20:13| a couple good points very candidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| I felt it very reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8419)|
| 2:20:21| in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:23| what we were receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8423)|
| 2:20:25| for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| for the amount that we were going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| for them to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8431)|
| 2:20:33| for that essentially 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| by us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8437)|
| 2:20:39| and it just it makes their board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:41| more comfortable with going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8441)|
| 2:20:43| forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:45| I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| and in normal economic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| times it might not be such a stretch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| for us but right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| even though you've said that the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| and all are behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| my idea is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| and I kind of got this from the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| but then I'm beginning to get something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| that this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| just fallback money in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| they ran over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8471)|
| 2:21:13| well it happens if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| it's not a contingency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| in other words to enter into the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8477)|
| 2:21:21| we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8483)|
| 2:21:25| but now like I say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:27| we can include language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| in the contract that would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| that the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| or we get our $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:37| back or not paid until that time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8497)|
| 2:21:39| or something that guarantees us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8499)|
| 2:21:41| that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| what we're anticipating to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| I think that we can work that language out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| they have $10,000 left over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| can we get that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| that is not something that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| ever discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8517)|

| 2:23:09| that is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8589)|
| 2:23:11| well it's close to Pellissippi State right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| it's right it's where the old unemployment office used to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8593)|
| 2:23:15| next to Morita| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8595)|
| 2:23:17| next to the old Kearns Bakery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| it's closer to our town from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:21| it's right next to the regions bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| and next to the PBS station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| the contract that is signed right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| is the contract for 90,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| have you got a signed contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8609)|
| 2:23:31| no we don't have a signed contract because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8611)|
| 2:23:33| the estimate that was given to us is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8613)|
| 2:23:35| over a year old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| and everything has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:39| now as far as cost of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8619)|
| 2:23:41| and that's what has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| given the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| a little bit of apprehension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| 90,000 dollar build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| fee that is over a year old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| well then don't you think you need to get a current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| bid and come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| maybe you can get it cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| I just feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| I'm like Brad Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| I'm for your project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| but I'm very uncomfortable just saying hey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8645)|
| 2:24:07| we need 20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8647)|
| 2:24:09| somebody else is going to come up to us next month and say we need 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| we're starting a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:13| that unless we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8653)|
| 2:24:15| hard figures that we can take to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| bank and we've got signed documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8657)|
| 2:24:19| we're into this like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| building a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| tell us what it's going to cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| bottom line and they'll stand behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| if you can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8667)|
| 2:24:29| because I'm not going to vote for this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8669)|
| 2:24:31| somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| talked about it's tax payers money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:35| it's tax payers money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8675)|
| 2:24:37| that we're giving away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8677)|
| 2:24:39| and I'm not for giving it away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| people work hard for their taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| and they don't want to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| what they pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:47| they want to keep as much in their pocket as they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8687)|
| 2:24:49| and what we're doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8689)|
| 2:24:51| let's all throw in some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| and also you've got a board of directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| where's the board of directors coming on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8695)|
| 2:24:57| 20,000 dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8697)|

| 2:25:03| are you doing a fundraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| to raise that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| well we're taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| on all the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| of the build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| the drug court's doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8713)|
| 2:25:15| nothing in fact they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:17| the provision if it doesn't meet their standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8717)|
| 2:25:19| of not even occupying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:21| the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8721)|
| 2:25:23| that's been built out or let's say we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8723)|
| 2:25:25| fall short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8725)|
| 2:25:27| then they don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| they can opt out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| not to even occupy the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| therefore the agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| would be stuck with a built out floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| meeting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| specifications of the drug court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:41| and we would have to go find another tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| in all due respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| I just don't think you guys are ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| you're not ready to come before us today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:49| because you don't have hard facts and figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| and I'm not going to vote for something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| we don't have hard facts and figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8753)|
| 2:25:55| you get a signed contract or a bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| and it will be good for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| you could tell them you want a 30 day bid, 60 or 90 day bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8759)|
| 2:26:01| to hold it until you get with your board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8761)|
| 2:26:03| and see what you come up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| and if you need to come back to us, come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| or is your board going to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| non-profit event and try to raise that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| I just don't think you guys are ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8773)|
| 2:26:15| and all due respect Judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| Commissioner Burroughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| May I address one point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8783)|
| 2:26:25| I don't take issue with what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| we can't come back with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| signed contract until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:31| have approval of this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8791)|
| 2:26:33| we can come in here and tell you what the hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| facts are, we can get a re-bid and tell you what the hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| facts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| but I think one thing that you need to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8799)|
| 2:26:41| in sight on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8801)|
| 2:26:43| is that you say, and I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| that we're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| taxpayer dollars, we're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| $20,000 in taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| we save the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8811)|
| 2:26:53| millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8813)|
| 2:26:55| by doing this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| so when you look at what you're investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8817)|
| 2:26:59| what you get for what you're investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| it's an incredible investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| that's a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| so I just wanted to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| Commissioner Burroughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| yes, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8829)|
| 2:27:11| I agree with you completely that this is an excellent investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8831)|
| 2:27:13| of taxpayer dollars because it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8833)|
| 2:27:15| generate so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8835)|
| 2:27:17| of a savings for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| and you said that the current bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| that you have is a year old or over a year old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8843)|
| 2:27:25| well, construction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:27| have actually dropped over the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| year so there's a very excellent chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| that if you do a re-bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| that it's going to come in even lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8853)|
| 2:27:35| than your original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| and that's another reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| I think it would be good to postpone this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8859)|
| 2:27:41| to give you the opportunity to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8861)|
| 2:27:43| can you tell me who owns the building right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| I believe Midway owns it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| you own it? Midway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| Mr. Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| my point was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8877)|
| 2:27:59| I don't want this to be the difference in a marble countertop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| versus a linoleum countertop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8881)|
| 2:28:03| and I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:07| are you going to be serving more clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8887)|
| 2:28:09| with expanded space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| I certainly hope to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8891)|
| 2:28:13| what it provides us is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| right now in this 3200 square feet that we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| a significant portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| I don't know the exact square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| is a storage room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| that when we were at our high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| we were using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8905)|
| 2:28:27| high in terms of number of clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| we were using as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8909)|
| 2:28:31| meeting room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8911)|
| 2:28:33| counseling room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8913)|
| 2:28:35| this provides us with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:39| space to handle the clients we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| and hopefully we can increase the clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8921)|
| 2:28:43| and what we would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| to do eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| 3000 square feet that we'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8929)|
| 2:28:51| that will not be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| is if we can get grant money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| put that into a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8939)|
| 2:29:01| because there is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| lack of halfway houses in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| and we have people who are sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8945)|
| 2:29:07| out there at the penal farm right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:09| because we can't get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| into a halfway house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| and if they have to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| we think if they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| successful on the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| so again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:21| I hope I've answered your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| I just personally I don't want this to be the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| between luxury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:27| and necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| the integrity of the drug court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| is on this in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| because if you're planning on putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8973)|
| 2:29:35| residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| you're going to come back and ask for more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8979)|
| 2:29:41| I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8981)|
| 2:29:43| I'm not stupid enough to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| any promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:47| but it's not our intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:49| to come to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8989)|
| 2:29:51| to ask them for residential space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:53| now I'm not telling you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8993)|
| 2:29:55| that will never happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:57| but it's probably not going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| in my tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=8999)|
| 2:30:01| I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| the only way that we see that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| do that is by getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9007)|
| 2:30:09| a specific grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:11| that will allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| this grant that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9015)|
| 2:30:17| specifies what it can be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| and it cannot be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9019)|
| 2:30:21| improvements like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| or residential facilities or other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9023)|
| 2:30:25| it's specified what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| can use it for and that's what we use it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| Mr. Jarrett you wanted to address the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:33| I just wanted to make it clear to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9033)|
| 2:30:35| and to Judge Baumgartner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| we tried to confer on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:39| if I thought this request was per se| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9039)|
| 2:30:41| illegal I would have told the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| and the judge and I would have told this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9043)|
| 2:30:45| just immediately that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9045)|
| 2:30:47| you can't do this period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9047)|
| 2:30:49| the problem is this came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9049)|
| 2:30:51| as a contract negotiation and normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| that's what we do but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| fell into the policy arena for two reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| consistently the grant documents read that there would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| not be any county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:03| matching funds and secondly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9063)|
| 2:31:05| it is for a private entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| so that's why it now becomes a policy issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:09| if the commission ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| feels that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| in accordance with public policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| and they base that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| on the information received that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| but again that's the reason this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9079)|
| 2:31:21| before you this went from being just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9081)|
| 2:31:23| purely legal contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| negotiation to a policy decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| that the commission has to make I think openly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| Mr. Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| thank you Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| from going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:37| the clock's messed up that I just looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| I think going from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| where we were going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| for an hour we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| about beat this horse to death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9105)|
| 2:31:49| I hear lots of good issues being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9109)|
| 2:31:51| raised I don't think it helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| to surround the issue of the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| that the judge is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9115)|
| 2:31:57| wanting to work to do something for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9117)|
| 2:31:59| Knox County that's going to save the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| several more dollars than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9123)|
| 2:32:05| what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9125)|
| 2:32:07| $20,000 is insignificant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| on the landscape of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| and I don't even know that I heard where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9135)|
| 2:32:17| $20,000 is going to come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9137)|
| 2:32:19| is the mayor of Knox County involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| he is not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9141)|
| 2:32:23| it took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| I saw Mr. Rice as I was coming in the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| he was going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9147)|
| 2:32:31| as I said I approached Mr. Troyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:33| first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| he consulted with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:37| I then went up and met with the mayor and Mr. Rice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| two or three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9159)|
| 2:32:43| you know one of those meetings Mr. Troyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| was in and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9165)|
| 2:32:47| they told me that they believed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| that they could find and did find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| that $20,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9171)|
| 2:32:53| now where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9173)|
| 2:32:55| public improvement fund John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| is that what you're telling the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| yeah I mean we build into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9179)|
| 2:33:01| budget a certain amount of money for building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| maintenance and building improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9183)|
| 2:33:05| and it's available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:07| this purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:11| and if the judge is wanting to hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| Midway or whoever's feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9193)|
| 2:33:15| to the fire and make sure we get our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| best dollar our best bang for the buck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| I'm in favor of us doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:21| this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:23| Mr. McKenzie I guess I'd just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:25| to kind of hear the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9207)|
| 2:33:29| substitute motion is to defer for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9209)|
| 2:33:31| well defer for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:33| days with the purpose of all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| affected involved entities will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:37| meet and hammer out an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| that meets everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:41| or satisfies everyone's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:43| about they will spend their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9223)|
| 2:33:45| first before they get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9225)|
| 2:33:47| our $20,000 that they will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9227)|
| 2:33:49| go and get a fresh bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9229)|
| 2:33:51| those are the things that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:53| want to happen before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| before I commit the county to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9235)|
| 2:33:57| and that's no reflection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| on judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9239)|
| 2:34:01| or Midway or the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| I think it's excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| but I do feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9245)|
| 2:34:07| it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9249)|
| 2:34:11| due diligence to postpone it for 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:13| days and see if we can't hammer out those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9253)|
| 2:34:15| details and rather than saying yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| go ahead or no absolutely not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| I think that's a good compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| Mr. Norman the chair might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| want to explain to the people that just walked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| in which Midway we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9265)|
| 2:34:28| yes we have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| Midway coming up at 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| I'm not going to express my opinion on that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| my wife will be here to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| Commissioner Wright did you have something else to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9276)|
| 2:34:38| yes thank you Mr. Chairman and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9278)|
| 2:34:40| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9280)|
| 2:34:42| what I stated there a moment ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9282)|
| 2:34:44| all of those concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9284)|
| 2:34:46| we as commissioners have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9286)|
| 2:34:48| whether it be Commissioner Broyles or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| Commissioner Smith I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| holding all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:54| the statements that have been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9294)|
| 2:34:57| and deferring them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9297)|
| 2:34:59| to the judge and expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9299)|
| 2:35:01| him to take care of all those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9301)|
| 2:35:03| of commission and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:05| my estimate of the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9305)|
| 2:35:07| and how we'll be voting right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9307)|
| 2:35:09| so the substitute motion is deferred for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9309)|
| 2:35:11| with the caveats that Commissioner Broyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9311)|
| 2:35:13| had talked about all those in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| of deferring 30 days say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| all those opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9317)|

| 2:36:13| concerns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9373)|
| 2:36:15| I might talk to a few of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| during that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| to get any questions answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| Chairman each of the commissioners needs to see me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| before they leave the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| yes if you would see Commissioner Brown on a very important item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| has nothing to do now with Knox County business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| we're not violating anything but anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101217part1?start=9389)|
