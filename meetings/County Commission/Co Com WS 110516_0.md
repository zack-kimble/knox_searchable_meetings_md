| 0:00:21| Commissioner Shouse. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=21)|
| 0:00:23| Mr. Shouse is here and I believe Commissioner Brown is here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=23)|
| 0:00:26| Do we have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=26)|
| 0:00:31| Yes, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=33)|
| 0:00:36| I'd like to add a contract with the East Tennessee Design Center for planning for improvements for the mascot park to $3,290.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=36)|
| 0:00:46| It will be all Robert Wood Johnson grant funds used for that, no county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| We will add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=50)|
| 0:00:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| Subject to commission approval, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=53)|
| 0:00:57| Commissioner Briggs is not here, but they've asked that the issue with regards to the fee offices be deferred for 30 days or until our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=57)|
| 0:01:05| So we will add that as an amendment that that be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=65)|
| 0:01:08| Mr. Chairman. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| In discussion items, could we pause at the end of the meeting here and talk about redistricting for a moment so that I might know what's going on on redistricting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=69)|
| 0:01:20| Also, June 7th and 8th in Gatlinburg is the Tennessee Counties Association or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| Are there people attending that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| I'd like to have a discussion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| And also, we've had something on our agenda in the past couple of months about the payment of legal fees for elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=93)|
| 0:01:45| And I've heard that that's come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=105)|
| 0:01:48| I'd like a discussion item about paying legal fees of county commissioners of previous commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=108)|
| 0:01:56| We'll discuss it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=116)|
| 0:01:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| These are just discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| And Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| The trustee's department here today, Chad Tindall, wants to withdraw 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| Yes, Mr. Chairman, Commissioner Smith, fellow commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| I just want to make a brief announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| I do want to withdraw number 30 out of number 30 on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| Just briefly, when I am speaking with Trustee Duncan, we've looked at a lot of things in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| one of which was the fact that we've not had a surplus sale of Knox County-owned property in about three to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| In that regard, I filed this resolution to have a surplus sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| We were ready to have a surplus sale of property purchased at the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| But subsequent to that, I've had a chance to have a conversation with Grant Rosenberg, with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| also some brief emails with our law director, Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| What we want to do is withdraw this for now because Knox County does own additional properties that were not purchased at the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| There's other inventory of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=174)|
| 0:02:56| We want to come back to commission with a very comprehensive proposal to market Knox County-owned property in order to get the best price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=176)|
| 0:03:04| and also to get this property back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| We need to have, I think, a systematic approach in selling this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| and we want to come back with not just a surplus sale, which we're ready to do in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| but a better way of maybe disposing of some of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| But we hope to have that back to you within 30 to 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| But for now, I think it's best that we not proceed with the surplus sale, and that's the reason I asked to withdraw that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| Item number 31, which we deferred from April, we need to defer that again until after the next audit committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=215)|
| 0:03:50| Defer until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| You said defer until the next meeting or the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Actually, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| We probably need to defer it 60 days because I don't think the audit committee is going to meet before our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| So let's defer it 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Mr. Rosenberg?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| I respectfully ask that item number 15 be deferred 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| Item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=251)|
| 0:04:28| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| Commissioner Burroughs, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| So do I hear a motion that we add what needs to be added, defer what needs to be deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=278)|

| 0:04:47| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=287)|

| 0:06:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| There's a blank there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| Yes, was that the reappointing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| Is that just because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| I mean, is it okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| It's not our appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Is it okay to leave a blank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Maybe I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| Could we go up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=382)|

| 0:06:27| If I could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| That is the one appointment on the board where the nominating group gave three names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=388)|
| 0:06:40| So the commission just needs to choose one of those three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| And you have the resumes in your packets, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=405)|

| 0:06:53| And I'll just ask that we defer it or not defer it but move it on to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Since we've got Lynn here, I would like to take 25 off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=421)|

| 0:08:40| I was just wondering if you would give us a summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| sort of if there's anything of particular interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| as regards drainage issues and erosion, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| Commissioner, these go straight on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| and I normally don't see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| So if I could, I'll just bring the file with me on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| If you wanted to send it along with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| I would have the records with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| You want us to change our motion, Tony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| I'd like to change my motion to assume without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=551)|

| 0:09:26| Item 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| It's approving a three-year contract between the Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| and Knox County Air Quality Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=571)|

| 0:09:47| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| Lynn, I just wanted you to update us a bit on how are we doing in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| non-attainment status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=599)|
| 0:10:01| Could you give us somewhat of an outline of your perception of how we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| with air quality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Lynn Lidington, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| As many of you know, we have now achieved the ozone national ambient air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| quality standard that was set back in 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| We have officially been recognized by EPA as an attainment for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=624)|
| 0:10:31| Not to get too excited too fast, there is a new standard coming out this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| that will probably put us back into non-attainment within about a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| after it comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| That's not a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| This is something that EPA has to set the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| There's still a lot of discussion and debate going on at what level that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| standard will be set at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| You know, it's kind of like we high-jumped five feet and got to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| and now the bar just got raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| You know, the air quality itself is getting cleaner all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| But from a health-based standard, the studies are showing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| maybe we need to make it even cleaner than it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| On PM 2.5, which is particulate matter, in a two-and-a-half micron size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=671)|
| 0:11:17| which is actually one-thirteenth the width of a human hair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=677)|
| 0:11:20| something you never see, but it is easily inhaled, cilia in the nose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=680)|
| 0:11:26| and that do not keep it out, so it gets down into the lungs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| We are presently meeting that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| We have started the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| It's approximately a two-year procedure for EPA to declare us attainment for that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=695)|
| 0:11:41| We have to go through a period where all of the data for past three years has to be verified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| as to its accuracy, quality assured, quality controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| After that, EPA will issue a certification that the data is clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=713)|
| 0:12:00| It's called a clean air determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And then after that, we will start the procedure to be named as attainment for PM 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=724)|
| 0:12:12| So the new standard that's more stringent, is it also in reference to 2.5, or is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| The new one, there's actually one coming out for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| The PM 2.5 standard, if it doesn't go extremely low, we will still be meeting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=744)|
| 0:12:32| The ozone, however, at the range that they are proposing to set it at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| will plunge most of the south into non-attainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| It's a very, very big jump for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| The next item is on page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| It's item number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| It's a resolution ratifying private chapter number 9, House Bill number 2127,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| private acts of the Tennessee Legislature relative to the Tennessee Technology Quarter Development Authority Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| and requesting the Knox County Law Director to ensure that notice of the Knox County Commission's ratification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| and said legislation is sent to the Tennessee Secretary of State, Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| I'm on the Technology Quarter Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| I was going to make sure that everybody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Well, I guess I'm, what was the point of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| It's cleaning up some of the enabling legislation to kind of how we do things now based on what we did back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| But there's nothing coming down the pike from the state that's going to do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| No, it's just asking the state to approve the changes we requested in enabling legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=828)|
| 0:13:54| It kind of streamlines it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| So are we going to hear anything back from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| Sir, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Are we slated with this passage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| Do we have words in there that we'll hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| It sounds like we're asking them to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| We're asking them to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| It gives us more local control on some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Mark wants to, it gives us more control on some reviews and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| It makes the building permit process a little smoother, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| So, and my question is, while you're answering this, are they now on, if we pass this, they owe us some information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| Actually, the state legislature has adopted the private act and, in doing so, require Knox County to ratify that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=867)|
| 0:14:38| So this is literally the second step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Then we follow that along with item number 36 on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| which is the changes to our ordinances to reflect the changes in state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Item 28 is a resolution requesting that the Metropolitan Planning Commission recommend amendments to those sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| in the Knox County Zoning Ordinance prohibiting the sale of beer for consumption on premises of establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| located within 500 feet of a residential or agricultural zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| to provide that any such provision shall not apply to any establishment licensed by the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| to sell liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I guess is this better as an ordinance or as a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| Remember, I'm looking at the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| I mean, is this substantial, I guess, or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| Are we talking number 28?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| At this point, what we're doing is asking the, essentially, MPC to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| Ultimately, if we're going to amend the code, then we'll do it by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| But because this process encompasses multiple sections of the zoning ordinance, we're asking them to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=960)|
| 0:16:11| But this also will put us more in line with what the city is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| Is that right, Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Yeah, I mean, I think this will be good in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| I just want to make sure that we're doing it the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Dance to the same drummer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| The next item is number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| It's a resolution approving the Fourth Amendment to the lease agreement between Westminster Regency, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| and the Knox County Drug Court for space located at 900 East Hill Avenue, Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| Before I ask for a motion on this, does someone here from drug court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| I had some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Given the future of the drug court, I'm hesitant to bring up a lease arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1014)|

| 0:17:00| I'm right lockstep with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| I mean, we got some information early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Then that went into the vapors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I really would like to get them to give us a plan, what they're doing and what the process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1026)|
| 0:17:13| and where they want to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Commissioner Orlenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I would recommend that we defer this for 60 days until we can see what's going to happen with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Motion is deferred for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| Mr. Chairman, before we get to that, can we ask the director of the drug court to come Monday and explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1050)|
| 0:17:37| I know what I mean, just kind of explain where if another judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| not the new appointed judge takes over the drug court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| if another judge has already just kind of given them an opportunity Monday to talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| instead of just throwing it off for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| So maybe we probably should reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Because Bumgarner's replacement may not assume we may not take over the drug court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| It may be a current court member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| So if they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| It's nothing done now when we can change it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| I just ask if somebody would send somebody from the director of drug court to come here, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| I'll pull my motion and then we can always Monday and we can send it on without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| and then Monday we can defer it if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| We can still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| We can still do that Monday if he shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Who had the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| I had the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| Sam and I had the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| We had the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| So we're sending it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| And will you, Jolie, will you make sure that the director of the drug court can be here to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| Send him a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1124)|

| 0:19:12| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| a second? What this is, is the Greater Schools Partnership is in conjunction with the entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1155)|
| 0:19:25| mentioned are embarking upon a reading program to encourage people to read their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| 20 minutes a day. And so we're expressing the fact that we think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| All those in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposition? It passes. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| Item 34 is resolution requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission, MPC, to review for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1179)|

| 0:19:59| Commissioner Briggs met with Commissioner Burroughs and I Saturday morning at TRIO's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| It was a properly sunshine meeting and he has asked that this be sent on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| So is there a motion to that effect? Second. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1207)|
| 0:20:16| Item 35, it's an ordinance amending Section 26.2 of the Knox County Code entitled Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| Waste Prohibited at County Convenience Centers to permit the acceptance of green waste at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| Knox County Convenience Centers. This amends Ordinance O-01-5-101 adopted June 25, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1228)|
| 0:20:36| This is on first reading. Motion approved. Is there a second? Dwight, would you explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| this to us as to exactly what you'll be accepting? Yes sir. Thank you Mr. Chairman. This will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| be the same, the green waste operations will be the same across the county just as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| at halls. Take small loads of the sorts of things that might be generated in a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| setting. We obviously will not be equipped to take great big tree sections and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| like that, but anything that you might trim from your backyard, small trees, things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| that. There is an old provision in the code that prohibits that from I think 2000-2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1267)|
| 0:21:15| and this simply amends that to authorize the acceptance of green waste at convenience centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| Any other questions Commissioner Smith? Do you need to accept John Sevier from that since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| you don't have a place to put it there? No sir, I think we're okay. We've run it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| the law department and they've been comfortable with it. Commissioner Smith. Dwight, had you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1293)|
| 0:21:40| considered maybe some of the places putting some chippers in? Because I mean you cram| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| those things full and you're just sending it out, but we could chip it right there on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| the spot. Have you thought about that? No sir, we actually have not. Let us confer about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| it with the staff a little bit. Some of the centers don't have a footprint that's big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| enough to permit it, but some do. And it certainly could be an option. I mean you could shoot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| that right over the rail and have something there to pick it or sell it, you know, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| there like they do whatever. Have a traveling chipper. Commissioner Wright. Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| I don't think that Knox County needs to get into running chippers. I think that the green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| waste is going to be handled by a contractor, right? At halls it's handled by... Well, Goodwill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1341)|
| 0:22:29| supervises the collection. Actually, the disposition of the green waste currently is through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Solway facility. We will probably take it to Forks of the River and either ship it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| a contractor to grind or grind it ourselves at Forks of the River. Right, but not on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| No sir, we historically have not ground it on site. And I think it was stated earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| today that this might be expanded to just three other centers right now, right? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| what you're thinking of having four centers, halls, and three more. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| All those in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposition? It passes. Next item. Item, we're on page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1384)|

| 0:24:13| and discuss it with us? Yes, Hugh, could you tell us what this means? Hugh Holt, Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| of Purchasing, 1000 North Central. This change in our code basically is deferring to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1459)|
| 0:24:26| HUD regulations when we're accepting certain HUD funds. That's all it is. It just allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| us to defer to HUD so we can continue to be in compliance with HUD. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1472)|

| 0:25:54| discussion regarding the Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan. I have had discussion with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Vice Mayor Bailey with City Council. They are scheduled to take up this matter tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| There is a sense with the City Council that they would be receptive to the idea of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| a committee, if you will, of City Council and perhaps County Commission and others to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| come to the table to look at the items in the Hillside Protection Plan that might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| eligible for compromise. So, I told them that I would be happy to bring that up with Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| today to see if there was sentiment to perhaps take a look at forming this committee, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| take a look at some of those issues that we might be able to sit down with and bring all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| parties to the table to see if there were some of those items that could be discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| further. So, I bring it up for your consideration. I am prepared to go before City Council tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| night and express the wishes of the Commission. I think we need to do something. We had one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| choice. We had two choices last month, either up or down. But I think everybody sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| up here agrees with the fact that there are some things that need to be changed to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| us all. So, I would make a motion that you do that, if that is what it takes. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| discussion? Commissioner Norman. Last month, it was suggested, I guess, or implied, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1627)|
| 0:27:18| there was on the side of those of us that are in favor of the plan, we are not willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1638)|
| 0:27:25| to compromise. I would just like to inform the Commission that I made several attempts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1645)|
| 0:27:34| to reach Mr. Edwards the week before the vote, and I got a Dear John email. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1654)|
| 0:27:44| have anything to talk about. So, a week before that, I don't know where this effort of compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| is going to go. I am certainly hopeful that we could work something out, but it was readily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1670)|
| 0:28:02| apparent to me that they could count to six and they weren't talking. But I'll be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1682)|
| 0:28:10| I'll be at City Council tomorrow night, and I'll be glad to see what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1690)|
| 0:28:18| I'm still interested in the criticism of the plan, because I don't see it. It's not significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| The things that the Chamber bring up are still non-issues. But I'm still willing to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1705)|
| 0:28:37| We're still willing to talk and see where it goes. Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Two questions. One, as Commissioner Norman was speaking there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| it looks like, looking into the audience, it looks like they were shaking in the no direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| It looks like maybe they are willing to come to the table. I'm hopeful that, as Commissioner Brown said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| and I do think most commissioners struggled with their vote on most, on either side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| So I do think amongst the 11 of us, there is room for compromise, at least I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1745)|
| 0:29:13| What, I don't know how deeply you and Vice Mayor Bailey have been engaged as far as what the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1753)|
| 0:29:21| will look like. Are we talking about citizens? Are we talking about only council and commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| Are we talking about a mix? Again, I don't know how deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| We have not gotten into it that deeply. I had a conversation with Mayor Brown last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| and a conversation with Mr. Bailey this morning. And they both indicated that they felt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| and they don't know, but they indicated that council might be receptive to working with commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| to put together a committee which would be, I would envision, it would be citizens as well as elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| or maybe all citizens. We haven't gotten into that deeply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| And I told them that I would be happy to come tomorrow night and express the wishes of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| if that is the wishes of commission, to look at doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Well, you know, and with us, and I guess the city will be having budget type hearings as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| so I bet we'll be meeting a lot. It would be good, with all of these meetings, I guess I'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| I'd like to get this one right. I hate to use that word, right and wrong, you know, win, lose kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| But I'd like to get this composition right in everyone's eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| Everyone's eyes. I would hate for the chamber to show up and say, well, we didn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| Or the folks who are more environmentally sensitive say, oh, well, it was stacked this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| I would like to get this one right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| I would like to get a commitment to see it through the end from both everyone on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| so that we don't have some of the things that happened last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| So I guess what I'm saying is I would, with so many meetings in the next little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| it would be good if you and the vice mayor could come together on a skeleton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| and then let both of us take a look at it to where if we've got issues, no, it's weighted too heavily this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| or weighted too heavily that way, we can hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| We agree on the committee composition and we move forward because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| hopefully this will be the second time we'll get something that everyone can get their arms around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Mr. Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Okay, here's the problem I have is that three years ago this commission came together with city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| and put together a committee and said, go look at this and bring us something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| And they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| And we said, no, sorry, not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| All right, six of us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| Five of us thought that it was just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| So I have a real problem with forming yet another committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| and letting them go off for who knows how long and bring it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| and have, again, a significant number of us say, nope, sorry, not good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1914)|
| 0:32:03| My concern is not just trying to find a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| but making sure that the people who are voting on this actually understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| because comments that were made at our meeting last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| especially with regards to the 15% slope issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| indicate to me that there are still members of this body who don't sufficiently understand the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| From comments that Mike Edwards has made publicly with city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| indicates to me that he still does not sufficiently understand the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| So if we're going to have another committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| then I would like to see it be limited in number and limited in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| And I would also like to make sure that everyone going forward can demonstrate a thorough understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| of what the plan actually says and what it actually calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| because I don't feel like everyone has done their homework on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| and that's one of the reasons that it's become such a headache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1986)|
| 0:33:11| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| I think this is a good idea to get with city council and speak to all the involved parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| I started with what Amy Staudter, Commissioner Burrell, started to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| You know, she didn't want this to happen because we said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| unless somebody from the prevailing side puts it back on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| without this compromise, somebody from the prevailing side has to put it back on the agenda for it to even be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| So I think this is the right thing to do in the interest of all parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| So I think it's a good, I mean, there are things in the plan that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| There's a lot of things in the plan that I like, but there's some that I didn't like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| And I couldn't vote for the plan without, couldn't compromise the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| couldn't change the plan until we voted the plan down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| And if somebody from the prevailing side doesn't bring it back up, it doesn't go on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| So this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2037)|
| 0:33:59| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| I support what you have said, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| And I think there are too many good parts of the plan just to walk away from it and let it go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| There are a few people that would like for it to just go away, but there are very few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Most of the developers, the realtors, the element that barraged us with vote against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| the vast majority of them said there's good parts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| So I encourage you to do that, and I will support a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| Hopefully there will be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Let me make sure I'm understanding what you're wanting to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| You're wanting commissioners, county commission, and city council to get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| and just have a meeting of those individuals, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| No, this would be, I think the intent would be a committee would be formed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| with city council and county commission input, which would look at the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| And those areas, I mean, you have a document that I think everybody agrees is a good document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2090)|
| 0:34:57| There are just some of those, there are some issues that needed to be compromised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| or I won't use the word compromised, looked at in further detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| And so I think that this is what city council is interested in doing is forming this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| that would be, and we haven't talked about the makeup of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Right, but that's what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Is the makeup of this group that's going to get together and discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| just the first blush at what might take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Would that just be city council people and county commission people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| Yes, I think Commissioner McKenzie had said maybe put together a proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2126)|
| 0:35:31| which would go to both bodies and let both bodies look at it and tweak it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| I mean, we could certainly have a joint meeting and hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| So those things are up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| I just want, you know, I'm in favor of moving forward with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| I was just trying to get a feel for what it is that we're moving forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Somehow if this gets, I'm very, I'm feeling similar to Ms. Boyles in that it's been a huge, long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2156)|
| 0:36:07| and there's some kind of latent in this, an implication that there's some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| there's something that's not quite right about the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| And I would refer the body back to the MPC vote, which was very balanced in terms of its composition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2178)|
| 0:36:29| We approved the task force, so we considered it balanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| even though at the end there was considerable amount of noise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| from some of the more developer-oriented portions of the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| So anyway, I just thought, you know, we say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| We just keep saying the same thing about the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| The process is good, the plan is good, the task force is good, and we vote down the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| So it just doesn't seem to make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| So I'll come and we'll talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| I would like for Mr. Hill, he's been standing there, go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| and he's got a comment or two relative to this process also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Yes, Mr. Hill, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| My name is Robert Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| I'm on 504 Mountain View Road in Farragut, zip code 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2238)|
| 0:37:26| I would hope that any committee that's formed on this has at least a proper method for citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2246)|
| 0:37:37| other than realtors and the few realtors who are opposed to it and the homebuilders to have input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| There's a lot of people interested in this there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| and I personally in terms of my experience with these kinds of things in another planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| think it's a very good document as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| Any document can be improved by the wisdom of more people and another look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| But I would hope that just for my sake and other citizens in the town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2285)|
| 0:38:13| that the county commission set out a list of things that they consider wrong with the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2293)|
| 0:38:22| so that you don't discuss the whole plan but just discuss the list of things that are a minimum list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| hopefully, that you'd really like to work on and see if there's a compromise for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| And if there is a compromise, what's the effect of it in terms of the whole plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| So that's the criteria, it seems like to me, for any committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| a joint committee of city council and county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| to operate on the plan that you've got before you now or you did have before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| and you've essentially brought it up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| but without some specific items to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| the committee could wander around for months and not come to any conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| So I would urge the chairman and the rest of the commission to put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| those of you who would like to see things change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| put together the things that you want to change and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Yes, I'm sorry if I gave the wrong impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| I'm not opposed to this group being put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| I'm disappointed that we've already had a group that worked for three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| and we told them that their work wasn't good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Quite frankly, I don't like the idea that this needs to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| Like I said, and I do appreciate Mr. Hill's statements, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| In fact, I would like to make that part of the criteria for putting this group together is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| and as I said, one, that it be limited in number and in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| so that there's a definite deadline for when they're going to report back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| to the city council and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| and that it be composed or comprised of as small a group as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| The more people you start adding to a group, the more unwieldy it gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| the more difficult it gets to get anything accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| And I would like to also make it part of the criteria that the commissioners who are opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| and city council people who are opposed to this plan articulate their issues with the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2431)|
| 0:40:37| meaning write it down, what specifically is it that you have a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| so that we can determine is this something that is just a misunderstanding of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| or is it truly an issue that needs to go back and be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| I would like to ask that those be included in the criteria for putting this group together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| as you and Joe get together on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Well, tomorrow night will be the opportunity to come and discuss it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| It hasn't been discussed and I will report back to you at our Monday meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| on what happened and any discussions that the council people have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| and we can decide where we want to go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| So, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| It sounds like what will be forthcoming will be something like a true workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| which we never really had with city council where we don't have, it's not a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2484)|
| 0:41:35| it's just us talking about the plan and the issues here that are before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| and I think Mr. Hill makes a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| So, this would be not just about the composition of whatever group is that does an evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| of what's already been done, but also we lay out exactly what are the sticky points to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2507)|
| 0:41:55| and we offer that up and so those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| Those are good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| That would be a good format for a workshop for just us and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| I think that would be very productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| So, I want to make sure that I properly relay your sentiments to them tomorrow night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| and that is that we're very willing to meet with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| We think it's a great idea for the two bodies to get together to talk about the formation of a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| to look at the sticky points, but we want to articulate what those points are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| so that we don't have people just out there plus a timeline as to when this report would be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| and that it would be small but balanced so that it's not favoring one group or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| Then I will appear before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| I will come back on Monday and let you know what those discussions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Before we get to the next item, I want to have just a brief discussion here on the budget again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| At the chairman's lunch on Monday, we do not have beer board Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| so we're going to have a couple of hours that I thought we would devote to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| Are there any particular areas that you want me to have someone come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| because I was going to have other departments come that were not here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| like Parks and Recreation, for example, some of the constitutional offices come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| but is there anything in particular that you would like to focus on during that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| Because I don't think it's going to take very long for those budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| Well, I'm sure finance will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Just to kind of prepare you, I have a few questions about, and I've sent John some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Just let him know I'll be asking questions about those things that I had submitted to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| and he has given me a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| And then I'm guessing Monday is our time to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| deliberate on some of the other actions that the mayor took as it relates to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| We can, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| Also, depending on the agenda, I had thought after we were through with our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| that we could spend whatever time was remaining before zonings to discuss the budget again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| So I think that we're going to have about three hours or so to delve into it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| And we can meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| We can have more meetings if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| I'm just wanting to know the pleasure of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| I'd like to, I have questions for community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| I also have questions for human resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2653)|
| 0:44:20| I'll make sure that they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| To start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| I'd like to have a, and it doesn't have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I'd like to have a time in the evening to where people can come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| and express their opinions to the budget, to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| I think when we do it all during the daytime, I don't know that we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| the people that are involved in it or affected by it may not be able to get away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And so if you see fit, I'd like to have, and it can be here, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| nighttime is easier to park here, but I would like for us to always, every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| have an evening time of debate about the budget so that the people that are affected by it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| but work for a living can come and express their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| We'll have time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| I'm wondering if, I don't know if any of these zoning issues are contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| Is that enough time, you think, Brad, maybe after zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| We could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| I mean, I don't, I think it's just a couple of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| I don't see anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| I think it would be a good time to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| So could we just maybe set a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| 6.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| 6.30 and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Or after, yeah, and that gives people an evening to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and it doesn't bring us here another night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| So 6.30 next Monday will be public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2733)|
| 0:45:34| Budget, public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| Jolie, you've got all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| We'll get closer with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| We'll send out the agendas to everybody if that's kind of what we'll be working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| And the call meeting will be June 13th, which, again, gives us time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| If we need to, we can have additional meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Next up is item 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| Discussion regarding economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| We have folks in the chamber of partnership who have asked to address us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| and so you are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| I'm Rhonda Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| I'm the vice president of the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Doug Lawyer is handing you some information today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| and he is the vice president of economic development for the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| We are not here to ask for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| We are simply here to do kind of some catching up and reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| We've been trying to get this meeting for a while now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| but schedules have not allowed us to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| I want to talk with you just briefly this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Oftentimes when we're talking about the chamber or economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2794)|
| 0:46:40| it's large projects or large things that are discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| And what I want to do today is give you an opportunity to review all the many customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| that the Knoxville Chamber serves, including Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| The first document that you were handed says Knoxville Chamber customers at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| And if you will look at this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| you can see that the things that are fully funded and supported by the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| and its membership dues are in the dark gray color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| The things that are supported in addition to those membership dues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| in connection with Innovation Valley are in the orange type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| What I'd like to do is highlight just a couple of things in each of these categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| allow you the opportunity to look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| and then we will talk specifically about economic development from the recruitment standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2854)|
| 0:47:42| I'm going to start with the startup and small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| We work in conjunction with a number of agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| One of the things that the chamber believes in very strongly is to not duplicate any services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| And so if there are other agencies that we can support that we can work and partner with to provide services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| such as the Tennessee Small Business Development Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| which we provide space in our facility to counsel startup and small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| These are individuals who come in who want to learn how to write a business plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| who need tax financing information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| These type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| So in working with a lot of the small entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| we are able to reach a number of individuals through their counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| that would not be available if they were not one of our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| Another group that we work with are a lot of our entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| In working with other agencies and looking at ways that we can define basically a virtual one-stop shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2916)|
| 0:48:44| not more bricks and mortar, but as a lot of our entrepreneurial companies are working out of their house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| or their garage, they need resources, need to know where to go and to find those resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| So with InnovateKnoxville.com, a website that is under development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| we are working with a number of community groups, agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2940)|
| 0:49:05| and private sector individuals to come together to help grow this particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| We've seen quite a few successes with incubators in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| and some companies that have started and formed out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| And we want to continue to grow this segment of our market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| Small business area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| There's a number of things that the Chamber does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| The majority of our membership base, almost 80 percent, is made up of small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| And so we spend a lot of time making sure that we're providing services to our members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| and to those companies in a way that can help them basically to survive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| what helps them to get to their bottom line so that they can be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| Chamber MD and RX is a brand-new program that we initiated and have received patent remarks on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2987)|
| 0:49:54| so that we can enable companies to come in and do an assessment and an online analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=2994)|
| 0:50:01| And then we have that all in our database, and we can have reminders come to us to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| all right, is Company X, are you reviewing your financial model like you need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| so that you know that you're going to meet the objectives at the end of that year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| And we have within our staff and our computer resources triggers that come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| so we can call Company X up and say, hey, we noticed you guys are on deadline for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| What's happening with your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| Making sure that these companies are really being successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| And that takes a lot of time and initiative to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| but we know that those are things that we need to be working on at the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Working with them also to help grow their businesses, the Chamber sponsors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| and has more than 35 different events specifically for our small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| and members throughout the year, or we have had so far this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| We end our fiscal year June 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| Out of those 35 different events, we've had more than 4,300 individuals attend those events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| and they can be anything from how to use social media in your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| how to survive the new norm, which is in regards to the new normal economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| or how to network and how to get new customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| How do you work with procurement offices to advance your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| So a number of those things to help with our small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| One of the things that I'm very proud to stand here in front of you today and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| is our Mentor-Protege Program through our small business and minority development staff person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3093)|
| 0:51:40| We started out with 15 individuals, and there are now up to 25 individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| and 25 companies who are participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| The Mentor-Protege Program, we have asked 25 of our large industries here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3110)|
| 0:51:57| to mentor these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| They sign on for a three-year commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| They meet on a regular basis, and they have been very successful in what they are able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3123)|
| 0:52:08| It's starting in its second year now in what they are able to do in helping with some of these companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| We've had success where one company was able to obtain a $2 million contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| because of some of the mentoring and associations that they received through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| And so these companies are growing and, again, looking at ways to help a lot of different individuals in a lot of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3145)|
| 0:52:33| General public section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| One of the things that I think oftentimes we forget is the number of people who call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| or walk in the door at the Chamber of Commerce who need information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| We send out, on average, more than 120 relocation packets a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| and usually have around 1,400 or so every year where there are new residents looking to move to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| That information is we gather from community information, from members, from a variety of sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| and it can be everything from where do I go to get a building permit, how do I pay property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| what schools are in the area, what are the opportunities for employment, all types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| But, again, the number that just come in and who are interested in moving to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| Our existing industry is an area that we spend an awful lot of time on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| because it is our firm belief that if you can't support and grow your existing industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| then you're not going to do a good job selling your community to those who might want to move here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| Unfortunately, we do not have a full-time existing industry person on staff now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3215)|
| 0:53:40| and we have divided those responsibilities among the different members of our economic development team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| as well as other members of the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| But we are currently looking at more than over 100 visits annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3228)|
| 0:53:54| In the past, that was up to more than 200, 250 visits annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| And, again, that was when we had a full-time staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| and we're twice recognized nationally as having one of the top leading existing industry programs in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| So it's something that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| We work with those companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| We want to know if they're having issues, if they need referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Work with a lot of the county departments, whether it's air quality or engineering or public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| and make sure that they're getting the right contacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| so that folks from the county can go out and help them with their issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| and that they might be able to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| In the government section, as I stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| we do have a contract with Knox County for economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| We take that contract very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| and we believe that we're trying to do the best to spur regional growth in our economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3279)|
| 0:54:45| and looking at ways that we can continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| We're always open to new ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| We're looking at ways that we can improve job growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Without a doubt, it's been a tough 18 months for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| but we know that those things are getting better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| and hopefully we'll continue to see that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| Some of the things that we also work with in that area related back to both existing industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| small business, and government relations is our workforce development programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| making sure that not only our children are getting the skills that they need in grammar school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| and then in high school, but whether they're coming out of a two-year training program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| or Pellissippi State or the university, making sure that they have the job skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3323)|
| 0:55:29| and the set of qualifications needed so that they can be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| and so that they have an opportunity here in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| Now going on to new business recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| If you don't let people know where you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| if you're not actively looking and keeping the pipeline full with new projects, new opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| when things happen in your economy and businesses make decisions to go elsewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| or when you're looking at filling some opportunities that you need to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3357)|
| 0:56:02| you have to always make sure you're talking to the right people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| making sure that they understand what it is about Knox County that we're selling, that we're offering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| because they know it's a great place to live, they know it's a great place to do business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| but so is everywhere else in the country, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| But we believe we're more well-suited for the types of things that can grow jobs here in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| So we spend a lot of time with a very targeted approach in working with site consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| working with the State of Tennessee's Economic and Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| and with the Tennessee Valley Authority's Economic Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| to make sure that not only do they have the right information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| but they know the type of projects that could grow and prosper here in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3400)|
| 0:56:46| We do this through a variety of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| I will not go down through this entire list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| but it's a never-ending message that we're trying to get out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| to make sure that they know what opportunities there are here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3416)|
| 0:57:03| The second sheet that I have in front of you, I thought it would just be well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| we've shared this with the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| and I just wanted Knox County Commission to look and understand that we appreciate your investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3430)|
| 0:57:17| that you have given to Innovation Valley since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| On the second sheet, what we've described is basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| it's a small example of a return of investment for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| And if you go down there, you can see that since 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Knox County has invested $1 million in our economic development efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| For that return in these program areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| you can see that there's been a return on investment from $178 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| and a creation of more than 2,500 direct jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Again, this is not Rhonda Rice's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| This is numbers that came from a third-party analyst and looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| But some of the things in different categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| you can see where companies have moved into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| You know, sometimes somebody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| okay, you guys have talked about Green Mountain Coffee enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| We need something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| Well, I would agree that we need something new, and we're working very hard to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| But when Green Mountain Coffee came here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| they were going to have 250 jobs and made an investment of about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| I'm sorry, 350 jobs and an investment of $55 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3504)|
| 0:58:34| They have expanded twice since they have been here already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| And so when we talk about them again, it's not that we're talking about the initial investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| It's that they continue to invest in Knox County and that they continue to grow jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| and they have well exceeded what they needed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| So that is an existing industry now, but it was a company that was recruited to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| There are some other examples down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| Melaleuca is a project that I think Doug probably worked on for about four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| It was a company that was located in Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| They had additional property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| They had purchased an old carrier building back in the early 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| And they had this property, and they sat on it for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| But when they decided they needed to do a distribution facility and expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| they wanted to talk to Knox County, but they looked at other places as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| But we worked with them, and they now have just an incredible facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| I know some of you have been out there to see that since they opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| and have added more than 200 jobs in really growing their business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| And that's a testament to the type of companies and the growth that we can see here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| I'll quickly go just a little bit on the last part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| Technology, mining, and matching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| We have an individual who is retired from Y-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| He's a part-time employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| And his job is nothing other than to work with companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| and connect them to resources that are available either through Y-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| through other companies that his 40-something years of experience in working at Oak Ridge can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3610)|
| 1:00:17| and help them to define projects or problems that they might need assistance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| And in doing so, he's had more than 525 face-to-face meetings with different individuals and companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| That's the type of thing that doesn't get talked about a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| It's the big news that always gets the headlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| But these things, they're very important to what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| And then I touched on the small business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| You can see a couple of the companies that are involved in the Mentor-Protege Program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| And then last but certainly not least, our education and workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| The Chamber has been involved in a number of educators in the workplace programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| We've had 190 teachers hit either on an in-service day or during the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| We have businesses who offer their facilities for teachers to come in and spend the day with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3665)|
| 1:01:11| and learn how those businesses and what they do relate back to the skill sets that our students are needing here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3671)|
| 1:01:19| We were assisting in the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Our vice president of education was instrumental in helping to write the application for the Race to the Top funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| And obviously receiving $13 million of that funding for Knox County is going to be a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| On the back, the last thing I'll mention is on the back you can see just an example of a few of the companies that we have worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3698)|
| 1:01:47| And these are companies that we have been involved with in some way or the other to help them to either retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| and grow in Knox County or to have a new home in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| And I guess the thing that I'd just like to leave you with is that when you talk about the Knoxville Chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| or Innovation Valley or economic development, just think of all those things as being synonymous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| because, you know, it's what we're trying to do for Knox County and to grow not only this region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| but to make it a better place so that we all are happy to call it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3737)|
| 1:02:22| I'll be happy to entertain any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3745)|
| 1:02:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Thanks, Rhonda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| You know, when I came on commission, one of my campaigns promises that I would work hard in filling up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3749)|
| 1:02:38| trying to fill up or help fill up, pushing people to fill up Westbridge and the Pellissippi Corporate Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| And, you know, I've spoken with Doug and Rhonda and on some occasions Mike Edwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3764)|
| 1:02:52| but I've been in office visits with Doug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| and I've had lunch with some people that are considering moving here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3776)|
| 1:03:00| and they're not sitting on their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| And, you know, when someone takes and talks about the chamber as a group that don't work hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| or do not work hard or that they're wasting our time and our money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| you know, I know of some projects that I don't know the names of their companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| I don't know the types of industry, but I know that the request for information has been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3801)|
| 1:03:29| and I know that there are things moving in my district and it's because they work hard at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| You know, every one of us have our own passion as commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| and every one of us seem to have our own one topic that we really push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| And this one is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| But I tell you, I have seen them work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| I have had lunch with somebody that, you know, used to work for a Fortune 500 company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3825)|
| 1:03:52| that I'd never sit across the table with otherwise, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| And so, and just sit here and let him explain that technology to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| and the potential coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| And, you know, it may not work out, but they're working hard at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| And I think that one will work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I hope it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| It will make a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| But, you know, they're not sitting there just collecting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| They're working hard at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| And, you know, Rhonda shared with me the other day, there's a company that came and toured Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| but Knoxville didn't have the perfect site, but we got them regionally, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| And so, you know, not everybody is going to come to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| but if they don't come to Knox County because we don't have space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| or the perfect site for them, that was kind of a shot in the dark anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| but we put them in the contact with people locally that will affect local people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| And so those are the things that they do, and I thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3881)|
| 1:04:45| And she did note she's not asking for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| They have tightened up like the rest of everybody else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| So thank you, Rhonda and Doug and Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| The last part of what Commissioner Anders spoke of, what I wanted to ask you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| I mean, this significant cut is being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| so you all are okay with that or, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| I'd be lying if I said I was okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| You know, it will have to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| You know, there are certain things that we probably will not be able to do because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| One of the things that, you know, we're very proud of the fact that for our Innovation Valley funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| almost 53% of that funding is from the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| And so, you know, we work hard to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| we are very accountable to the Innovation Valley Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| Dr. Tom Mason, the director of the National Lab, is the chair of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| So, you know, he very diligently wants to know what we're doing with those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| But one example of something that we're probably not going to be able to do in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| is editorial placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| And this is not buying ads or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| This is where we have very specific, detailed stories that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| that we get placed in either industry-specific magazines or publications online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| Obviously, we do a lot of online publicity or publications now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| But those types of things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| where we may get something touting about the success of a company here in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| because of some technology that they used at the lab, North America LED lights, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| that was new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| That story hit and it just revibrated everything that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| of how a small company can grow, how you can use the resources here in this region, and then go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| But if we don't have that kind of placement, then you're not going to get some of the attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| and you're not going to get some of the accolades and rankings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| like the Forbes ranking that we received last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| Yeah, you know, and I guess that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| And it concerns me greatly that I think we'd be short-sighted if we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4023)|
| 1:07:12| I think in the press there was something said, well, they shouldn't take credit for all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| And maybe that's correct, but it's hard to prove that someone wouldn't have come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4037)|
| 1:07:24| or came directly because of an Innovation Valley fund or this money went into that arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| The thing that I keep harking on is, you know, things got really, really tough out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4051)|
| 1:07:39| But I think in most communities, things were terrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| And that doesn't happen just because we're nice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| It doesn't happen because we're just a, you know, great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| It happens because of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| It happens because of, you know, some funds that we understood that we have to invest in things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4074)|
| 1:08:02| So I guess it does concern me that these things will not continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| But if you all, I'm not going to get into the chamber's business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| but if you all feel that you can continue to do those type of activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| and bring these type of numbers in with the proposed funding, then okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| But if not, I would encourage you all to tell us the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| This is what's going to happen if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| Here's what I would say to that, Commissioner McKenzie, is the fact that we will adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4109)|
| 1:08:36| You know, there will be things that we will not be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Hopefully, as this pipeline, as I've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| hopefully the things that we've been doing for the last several years, because these things don't happen overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| but hopefully some of those things that we've been in the pipeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| and working on for a number of years will continue, you know, to come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| But then I would also ask that as the economy does turn, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| commission looks at reestablishing the funding to Innovation Valley that we had originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| And as the economy improves, so does our local economy and so does Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4144)|
| 1:09:14| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you. I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| We have a couple more discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| And, Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| Oh, we have a resolution, too, that we need to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4162)|
| 1:09:28| This is the one Dr. Buchanan gave to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| This is the one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Do we have a number assigned to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Why don't we move this on without recommendation and we can get all the proper paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4178)|

| 1:09:42| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Let's move to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4188)|
| 1:09:56| Commissioner Wright wanted to add a discussion item regarding redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| What's happening on redistricting right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| As a matter of fact, Ms. Kincannon and I had a conversation about that just this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| The committee for the schools, we had agreed that we would have kind of a joint situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| They were going to form a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| We were going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| A letter has been sent to Mr. Donaldson with the MPC asking them to give us three proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| or the committee three proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Then that committee will meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| There has not been an initial meeting yet because they don't have anything to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| But Mr. Donaldson has been sent the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| They have been asked to look at bringing the school board districts and the commission districts as closely in line as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4234)|
| 1:10:41| But we've asked for more than one proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| And so they're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| I don't think Mr. Donaldson is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| I was going to ask him to come up and give us an update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| But I'll have that for you on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| Rick Emmett is still working on it too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| The committee here is going to be a representative from the town of Farragut who is their city manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| Mr. Rick Emmett was the city of Knoxville representative that Mayor Brown had proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4256)|
| 1:11:02| I have asked Commissioner Smith, ONB, Broyles, and McKenzie to act on our behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| And, of course, any commissioner can go to any meetings and provide input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| But it all has to come back to us anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| I think that I wanted to reemphasize the fact that a couple of chairman's lunches ago we sat together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4275)|
| 1:11:23| and the school board people there seemed to be in agreement about the fact that the school board districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4283)|
| 1:11:31| and the commission districts should, as close as possible, not necessarily mirror images, reflect each other or correspond to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4291)|
| 1:11:41| The one thing that I'd like to ask, it's only on my behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| and it be considered that the 8th district be as small as at least average or smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4305)|
| 1:11:56| We may sort of, well, we did snicker at it, but you see what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| That's just a, I don't want to give up people, although I know that my fellow chair seatmate right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4321)|
| 1:12:12| will have to receive people because he's below average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| And right now the 8th district below the average number of voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| I resemble that remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| So I'd like to give him as many, no, I'm not, I just want that to be a consideration that the 8th district be as close to the average number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4343)|
| 1:12:32| or slightly under it as opposed to any of the other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| That's just, and then I do like, I would like to know whenever the committee might meet if it's a date that I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4357)|
| 1:12:45| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| As soon as, I'll let you know Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| I'll check with Mark Donaldson on where they are on the progress on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| And I will get back to you all on when those meetings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| School board's going to have a work session in 25 minutes for those that want to go to a school board work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| Joe Lee, would you write up a letter on behalf of Mr. Commissioner Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| and send it to India Kincannon, myself, and Mark Donaldson expressing those, his desires there about the 8th district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| There was another discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| Also, the second discussion item, we in the past have talked about paying the legal fees of commission members when in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4395)|
| 1:13:24| and not represented by the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| I believe there's been bills being sent out again in the last month or so, somewhere in the $150 to $200 range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4408)|
| 1:13:40| dividing up the cost of some court action that occurred before most of our times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| Is that something that we as commission can discuss about those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| That was the resolution last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| I'm researching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| Because there could be some legal impediments and some cumulative effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| that can go into an infinitely large number than those individual bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| The two that I remembered in particular, one resolution has already passed us for former Commissioner Paul Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4444)|
| 1:14:14| Then we discussed the second one is related to my seatmate here immediately to my right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| But now I'm hearing other names on a different action that was a result of Mr. Monsieur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4460)|
| 1:14:30| I'm getting calls from people I've never even heard of now wanting to know if they could submit bills for legal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| Mr. Pinkston was unique because under the Tennessee Code, it was an ouster suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| and there's actually a Tennessee Code section on point that legally provided you a vehicle by which to reimburse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4480)|
| 1:14:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| So we've gone this whole new spate of individuals seeking redress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| And, again, that's the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| This can get into a huge amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| Well, I'm not aware of a large amount of money being brought forward at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| I was only aware of $150 to $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| That was the impetus initially, that and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| I'm saying since that resolution came out, I'm getting calls from people I never heard of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| and asking what's the process of getting their legal fees paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| I only had one call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| I'm glad you're getting all of them and not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4525)|
| 1:15:27| I'm very popular these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| Statue of limitations is one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4529)|
| 1:15:37| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| Commissioner Wright, you had one other discussion item about a conference in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| I left out the one in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| Who may be attending the Tennessee State?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| Something is occurring on June the 7th and 8th in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| I haven't decided if I can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| If I can, I'm not going to spend the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| I'm just going to go over for the meetings because I can drive up there and back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| It's the Tennessee County Services Association, and they've posted an agenda on their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| The only agenda item that I was interested in was the second half of the second day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| Does that mean we have to pay a $70 fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| or whatever the registration fee is to go attend just that one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| Jody, can you research that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| We'll ask her to research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| The thing about it is if that's the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| then I'll get that particular subject some other place at some other time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| because CTAS does a lot of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| It just so happens that's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I don't even remember now the area of concern or expertise that they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4598)|
| 1:16:43| It's the second half of the second day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| and that was the only item that they had on their agenda that I liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| Jody, I'll find out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Thank you, Jody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Is there any other business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| If not, we are adjourned until next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110516?start=4622)|
