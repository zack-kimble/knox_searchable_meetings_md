| 2:16:10| Why should he be granted a free run simply because he's an illegal immigrant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8170)|
| 2:16:16| That's what I just, I didn't understand that, but I thought based on what you said, Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8176)|
| 2:16:23| that my research showed that on getting the rap sheet on this Omar that looked like he was being a victim of the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8183)|
| 2:16:32| Just as a point of clarification, Commissioner Durrett, I believe if you send an official request to the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| you can retain that, or I'm sure there's a FOIA request that's not obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8199)|
| 2:16:45| Is there additional discussion on item number 43?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8205)|
| 2:16:49| Okay. Seeing none, we'll move on. Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8209)|
| 2:16:54| This is item number 44, discussion item regarding Knox County Schools security and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8214)|
| 2:17:02| Thank you very much. I added this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| Certainly, the events of our community in the last few weeks have sparked a lot of additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8226)|
| 2:17:15| There's a lot of people that were probably here tonight if they had stayed in a civil manner and participated in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8235)|
| 2:17:23| might want to engage in this, but I reached out to our school system because soon after the events of last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| especially on the east side of our community, I got a lot of calls from constituents, some from educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8251)|
| 2:17:39| certainly concerned parents, citizens, and one of the big questions is, is my school safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8259)|
| 2:17:49| That's one I couldn't quite answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| So I invited our superintendent, Bob Thomas, our head of security and operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8272)|
| 2:17:59| to simply come to us tonight and talk to us because I think this warrants a much bigger discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8279)|
| 2:18:04| We've been down this road a couple of times, and we don't want to continue to, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8284)|
| 2:18:12| But I'd like to hear from our school system what their plan is for security for all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8292)|
| 2:18:21| I'm not singling out one school, but I'm trying to address the many communities that we have all over Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8301)|
| 2:18:28| and we have a massive school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| And so I'd really like to sort of dig into that and hear everybody's concerns and comments and thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| and hear from our school system about how can we assure our families, our parents, our educators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8317)|
| 2:18:43| our grandparents, that their children are safe inside the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8323)|
| 2:18:48| I know we have lots of layers outside the school to think about as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8328)|
| 2:18:52| but certainly when you're in an educational center of excellence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| that you ought to never, in my opinion, ever worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| And so I invited our team here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8342)|
| 2:19:05| I'd like to sort of turn the floor over to them and then open it up for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| and certainly talk about what we're doing now but what we hope to do better in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| And if you could certainly just introduce yourself, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8354)|
| 2:19:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| Bob Thomas, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street, Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| And members of the County Commission, we appreciate the opportunity to come this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8362)|
| 2:19:28| and talk about security in some very general terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Let me just say, too, if you would wish to speak more specifically about individual kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8371)|
| 2:19:36| we would be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| Mr. Oakes is with me and also Gus Peduce is our Chief of Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8378)|
| 2:19:42| We'd be glad to talk with you more specifically, but just to talk with you this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| about what we're doing just in general terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8386)|
| 2:19:50| And certainly there's an ongoing investigation regarding the very tragic incident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8390)|
| 2:19:57| that happened at Austin East last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| And again, our hearts go out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| Our thoughts and prayers are with the staff there, the administration, the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8403)|
| 2:20:08| that have been impacted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| And we know, looking back to January, this is the fifth student that's been lost to gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8412)|
| 2:20:18| Some specific things I can talk about in regard to Austin East is how is it going to look different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| Wednesday morning when students report to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8424)|
| 2:20:27| And we met with Austin East staff this morning and communicated with the families this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8427)|
| 2:20:33| late this afternoon, or this evening, about what Wednesday looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8433)|
| 2:20:37| And what we're doing is conducting a search of all students upon entry to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| beginning Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| And we plan to continue that for the remainder of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8444)|
| 2:20:48| We're using our wands and our school security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8448)|
| 2:20:52| All doors are locked down during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| One other thing we've done, in addition to locking down those doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8457)|
| 2:21:01| is alarming those doors so that if there's any exit out of or entry into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| that an alarm goes off in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8467)|
| 2:21:10| And certainly we monitor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| After that, we are putting additional personnel outside in appropriate areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8472)|
| 2:21:19| to help us watch the campus in the event that a door is alarmed during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| So those are three specific things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| We've got a couple other things in mind, too, that we are going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| But those are three specific things that will happen Wednesday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| beginning Wednesday morning, when students return, and for the remainder of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| So in terms of more generalities around security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| Russ, let me get Russ up here and talk about, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| the things that you mentioned in terms of school security for our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| and what we're doing, and maybe some thoughts about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8516)|
| 2:22:02| Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| I jotted down some notes when you invited us over to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8527)|
| 2:22:13| to sort of give some context to security and what we do with respect to security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8533)|
| 2:22:21| And I can tell you that it's one of the most important things that we do in the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8541)|
| 2:22:27| Over the last eight to ten years, we've invested tens of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| in untold man hours in enhancing our security and making sure that we're doing what we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8552)|
| 2:22:40| to provide a safe environment for our staff and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8560)|
| 2:22:44| Security is a task that's never complete, and it's never good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8564)|
| 2:22:50| There's a constant tension between how much is enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8570)|
| 2:22:53| and how much is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8573)|
| 2:22:57| Security is not convenient, and that point alone is an irritant to a lot of folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8577)|
| 2:23:06| It is a constant balancing act between protecting our students and our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8586)|
| 2:23:12| and not interfering with the learning process as we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8592)|
| 2:23:17| I can tell you that we review the security status and policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| I can tell you that we review the security status and posture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8600)|
| 2:23:24| our security status and posture every day, and we adjust it as conditions dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8604)|
| 2:23:29| And we review it at every site every day and adjust as conditions dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8609)|
| 2:23:35| Our security staff is constantly working with local law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| to respond to known threats, both credible and not credible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8619)|
| 2:23:44| This work takes place daily, and quite frequently it takes place 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8624)|
| 2:23:51| Particularly with the number of social media threats that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8631)|
| 2:23:59| every one of those that we get picked up on gets investigated by our security staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| in conjunction with the Knox County Sheriff's Office and the Knox County Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| And quite frequently, when we're all in bed, we've got security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8650)|
| 2:24:16| and deputies and police officers out making home visits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| following up on threats and concerns and then helping us adjust what our posture is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8660)|
| 2:24:26| at various locations around the county based on the results of those home visits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| and those investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| I can tell you some of the actions that we've taken over recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8673)|
| 2:24:40| I'm sorry. Some of the actions that we've taken in recent years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8680)|
| 2:24:45| in addition to creating what I think is the largest and best trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8685)|
| 2:24:53| school security division in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| Our school security division goes through a rigorous background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8696)|
| 2:25:03| Candidates receive a psychological evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| They get a 10-week academy that not everybody passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8707)|
| 2:25:13| and a lot of people decide they don't want to be there after a couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| So when we get finished, the folks know their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8717)|
| 2:25:24| and we spend additionally at least 40 hours a year continuing training with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8724)|
| 2:25:31| And we also have training for our leadership staff that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| I'll talk about that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| But speaking to what we have done in schools and what we do with facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8739)|
| 2:25:45| in addition to the 105 security officers, uniformed armed security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8745)|
| 2:25:51| that are bonded by the Knox County Sheriff's Office in our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8751)|
| 2:25:55| we also have in place digital video systems in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| We have over 6,000 cameras spread across our 88 campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| Some of our larger schools will have well over 100 cameras on their camera systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8767)|
| 2:26:14| Can I interrupt for just a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8774)|
| 2:26:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Are those camera systems archived on a database, and are all campuses have camera systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8778)|
| 2:26:22| They are archived in a database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| and we have a very specific security protocol for how those camera systems get designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8787)|
| 2:26:33| the types of cameras that we use, and how long we'll archive that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8793)|
| 2:26:38| And that's stuff I can talk with you about one-on-one if you need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8798)|
| 2:26:45| Do all of our schools have cameras?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| And this goes, too, to what I was talking about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8810)|
| 2:26:54| that we constantly reassess what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8814)|
| 2:26:57| When we go back, we will reassess and we'll put cameras in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| and we're in the point now where it's when we look at different schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8821)|
| 2:27:05| and talk to administration, and every year we have to do a security assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8825)|
| 2:27:11| on all of our facilities and provide that information to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| We will identify things that may not have been considered a problem five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8834)|
| 2:27:22| when there was an assessment made, but we're looking at it now and we'll upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| So we're constantly adding cameras or moving cameras or adjusting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8846)|
| 2:27:33| so that's just one piece of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| We also have motion detection intrusion systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| in all of our schools, so if somebody comes in, we'll know you're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| and that way we know which cameras to look at to see what you're up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| All of our schools are locked during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8873)|
| 2:27:58| and visitors have to be buzzed in to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| That's a posture that we moved to seven or eight years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| and it's not convenient for a lot of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| but it's necessary in this day and age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8889)|
| 2:28:13| Schools have been provided visitor management systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| for their use to help identify individuals entering the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| and in the world of COVID, we haven't used those as much as we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8902)|
| 2:28:29| because our visitors to schools have been extremely limited this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8909)|
| 2:28:33| but those systems will identify the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8913)|
| 2:28:37| and help us make sure that that individual is who they say they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| and they'll check them against any orders that the school system may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8922)|
| 2:28:48| for no trespassing, and they'll also check to see if those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8928)|
| 2:28:53| are on any sex offender registries anywhere before we issue them a badge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8933)|
| 2:28:58| and let them come into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8938)|
| 2:29:01| We're currently implementing a new proximity card system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| to better control and track access in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8946)|
| 2:29:10| and to also eliminate master keys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| The challenge with master keys, if you've got a lot of them around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| they tend to get lost, and it's very expensive to do a rekey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| and if you lose your master key and you don't report it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| that's a potential threat out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| but if you lose your proxy card, we can set those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| so that they will become defunct after a certain amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8972)|
| 2:29:36| or if you lose your proxy card and you report it, we can turn it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| So that's an area where we really want to stress as far as security is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8980)|
| 2:29:50| We're also in the process of upgrading all of our keyed lock systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| and replacing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| We have invested in state-of-the-art digital radio communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| in all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9005)|
| 2:30:07| That's both the 800 megahertz system that we use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| to communicate with first responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| and the first responders to communicate with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9015)|
| 2:30:19| and our system is monitored by the 911 center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| and is used every day for us to communicate with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| and the dispatchers from the fire department, police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| and sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9031)|
| 2:30:36| We have also completed a survey of all of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| This is something that Commissioner Biggs brought up some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9042)|
| 2:30:46| We've completed a survey of all of our facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| to determine signal strength for all those digital radio systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| and that's something if you want to get into the details of sometime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| I'd be happy to sit down and talk to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| but we've found that we've got some signal strength degradation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9060)|
| 2:31:05| at some of our facilities, not all of them by any stretch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| but we're currently, I think next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9069)|
| 2:31:13| we're going to have on the Board of Ed agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9073)|
| 2:31:15| the contract with Motorola to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| and install distributed antenna systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9079)|
| 2:31:22| That will be a multi-million dollar, multi-year process, I'm afraid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| Some of them will be rather expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9089)|
| 2:31:32| Can I ask, what is your, I don't know if this is a question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| or Mr. Paduce, but what is your approach when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| I know you do general security for all the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9101)|
| 2:31:44| and you're constantly assessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| It's clear that this is a big part of your role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9106)|
| 2:31:48| but when a school has an uptick in violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| or if an area has an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9112)|
| 2:31:55| what is your process for re-evaluating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9115)|
| 2:32:00| understanding, adjusting, adapting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9120)|
| 2:32:03| How does your team go through what went right, what went wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9123)|
| 2:32:07| How do we do better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9127)|
| 2:32:09| I think that's something that's handled internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9129)|
| 2:32:13| within the security office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9133)|
| 2:32:14| and I can let Chief Paduce talk to you about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| but I can tell you that from the district level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9139)|
| 2:32:25| we will frequently do, if we have an incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| we'll do what in the Army we call the after action review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| and we'll do an assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| What did we do right? What did we do wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| What can we do better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| And that's with any type of incident we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9161)|
| 2:32:45| and then we'll implement changes in protocols if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9165)|
| 2:32:51| Chief, you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9171)|
| 2:32:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| If you could just state your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9178)|
| 2:33:01| Yes, sir. Gus Paduces, and I work out of 1000 North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9181)|
| 2:33:06| And just to kind of piggyback on what Mr. Oaks said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9186)|
| 2:33:09| obviously we have debrief any time we have a critical incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| We always sit down and try to figure out what went right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| and of course, most critical incidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| you have more things go wrong than right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9199)|
| 2:33:22| but our officers do reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9202)|
| 2:33:24| and we have a database of those reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9204)|
| 2:33:26| and it's very common for us to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9206)|
| 2:33:28| and figure out how we can improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9208)|
| 2:33:31| And of course, we know one of the best ways to get better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9211)|
| 2:33:34| is through supervision and training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9214)|
| 2:33:36| and sometimes it's a training issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9216)|
| 2:33:37| sometimes it's a policy issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9217)|
| 2:33:39| sometimes it's just a human performance failure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| but we are very aggressive when it comes to looking at incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9223)|
| 2:33:47| and talking to our personnel that are at the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9227)|
| 2:33:50| our supervisors in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9230)|
| 2:33:52| and obviously our administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9232)|
| 2:33:54| We are open to conversation with parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9234)|
| 2:33:57| about things that went right and things that went wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9237)|
| 2:34:00| so we are pretty aggressive in trying to be sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9240)|
| 2:34:03| we don't make the same mistake twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9243)|
| 2:34:04| Did you all perform, a little over a month ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| just barely off the Austin East Campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| a young man was shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9250)|
| 2:34:12| That was, you know, after several other incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| in that part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9255)|
| 2:34:17| Did you do such an after-action assessment of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9257)|
| 2:34:20| because that was my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| that was essentially right outside the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9262)|
| 2:34:24| Well, if you're talking about Mr. Freeman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9264)|
| 2:34:27| it was a short distance from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9267)|
| 2:34:30| It was close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9270)|
| 2:34:32| Yes, sir, it was close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| He was one of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9274)|
| 2:34:36| and so we did have a lot of conversation about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9276)|
| 2:34:39| and we put some changes in place moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9279)|
| 2:34:42| primarily an increased presence both inside the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| as well as outside the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9287)|
| 2:34:49| We're trying to be very visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9289)|
| 2:34:51| not only our division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9291)|
| 2:34:53| but the Knoxville Police Department helped us quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9293)|
| 2:34:55| about visibility in the mornings at arrivals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9295)|
| 2:34:58| visibilities in the afternoon at dismissal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| and then we supplemented some of the staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9301)|
| 2:35:04| for school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9304)|
| 2:35:06| And, of course, our core function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9306)|
| 2:35:08| school security, our core function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| is to develop healthy, appropriate relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9310)|
| 2:35:13| with young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| and so continuity is real important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9315)|
| 2:35:18| and we realized we could do a better job at Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| in terms of continuities at same face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| or those same sets of faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9324)|
| 2:35:26| so that kids get to know the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9326)|
| 2:35:29| because there, again, our core function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| is being part of the fabric of that school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9331)|
| 2:35:34| being a mentor and a role model to young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| It doesn't happen overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| and when you have an incident like we had last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| or certainly a month or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9342)|
| 2:35:44| that relationship building sometimes has to have a reboot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9344)|
| 2:35:48| and so we continue to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| but, yes, sir, we obviously had a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9354)|
| 2:35:56| And was there any discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9356)|
| 2:35:58| whether it be Austin East or other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9358)|
| 2:36:01| help me understand why we don't have metal detectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| in more places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| I can't, I mean, we talked about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| Mr. Oaks talked about the inconvenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| but, you know, I can't get on a plane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9370)|
| 2:36:12| with explosives and a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| We go through security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9375)|
| 2:36:17| It's something our community is adapted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9377)|
| 2:36:19| It's certainly not the learning environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9379)|
| 2:36:21| but it's something where our society shifted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| and, frankly, I don't worry about anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| with a gun on the plane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| because we go through a certain set of protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9388)|
| 2:36:30| and I'm wondering, and several people have asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| why have we not adapted our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| after, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9394)|
| 2:36:36| countless school shootings across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9396)|
| 2:36:38| and certainly in our own community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9398)|
| 2:36:40| you know, more and more violence around the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| Why are we sort of still doing the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9403)|
| 2:36:45| hoping that everything's going to be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| Well, let me talk about metal detectors for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9407)|
| 2:36:51| and then I'll let Gus talk about metal detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9411)|
| 2:36:55| They're a tool, but they're not a failsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9415)|
| 2:36:59| They have to be operated appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9419)|
| 2:37:00| and the operators have to be trained, and it doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9420)|
| 2:37:04| and it's not a small investment to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| when you start looking at the number of people it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9428)|
| 2:37:10| to properly operate one metal detector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9430)|
| 2:37:14| and the challenges that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9434)|
| 2:37:18| with bringing individuals in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9438)|
| 2:37:22| in a confined amount of time into a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9442)|
| 2:37:26| because one of the, anybody who's ever driven by a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9446)|
| 2:37:30| in the morning before school starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| finds out that everybody wants to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| within 15 minutes of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| that they're supposed to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| so it's a challenge to work with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| and I want to say that I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| that comparing operations at a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9466)|
| 2:37:51| to operations by the TSA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9471)|
| 2:37:54| is necessarily an accurate analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| Well, I certainly don't want to compare the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| but I went to the hockey game last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9478)|
| 2:38:01| at the Civic Coliseum, and they put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9481)|
| 2:38:04| I don't know how many thousands of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9484)|
| 2:38:06| that all show up in the last 15 minutes or 20 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| and there were more security there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| than going into one of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| There's more security coming into this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| and as many people as came in here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9496)|
| 2:38:19| than our schools, and I really struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| with being able to talk to parents and educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| and explain to them why we are so heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9504)|
| 2:38:28| on security in so many places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9508)|
| 2:38:30| except for the places where our kids learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9510)|
| 2:38:33| Well, we have tried to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9513)|
| 2:38:37| First of all, that's one site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9517)|
| 2:38:39| and we have 88 sites to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| but I want to tell you that metal detection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| we have looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9525)|
| 2:38:47| and we're not opposed to metal detection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9527)|
| 2:38:50| and we have used it as we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9530)|
| 2:38:52| random searches in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| but our concern is to try to not make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9535)|
| 2:39:02| every day at school a TSA experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9542)|
| 2:39:06| for kids as they come in and start the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| Now, are we getting to a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| where we may have to do that? Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| It's like other measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| We regularly discuss and reassess where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| and metal detection is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9560)|
| 2:39:22| that we're discussing right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| as, in fact, Chief Paducez and his folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9564)|
| 2:39:28| have a meeting later this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| with some folks who have a new system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9570)|
| 2:39:33| that's a weapons detection system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9573)|
| 2:39:35| that is not based on a ferrous object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9575)|
| 2:39:40| but may hold some promise in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| and may be less intrusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| but it's something that we want to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9585)|
| 2:39:49| and I think I'll shut up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9589)|
| 2:39:51| and let Chief offer you his response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| Can I jump in on this real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| Do we have metal detectors at Austin East?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| Do we physically have them on location there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| There could be a small number of handhelds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| and handhelds metal detectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9608)|
| 2:40:10| will be what we start with later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9610)|
| 2:40:13| Have we ever had them in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| Well, we've never had them fixed stationary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| but we haven't had fixed stationary walkthroughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9619)|
| 2:40:21| where we have it at a couple of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9621)|
| 2:40:25| but Austin East, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9625)|
| 2:40:27| has not had a fixed walkthrough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| but we distribute handhelds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9629)|
| 2:40:31| Our sergeants have handhelds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| so that if you have an occasion that pops up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9633)|
| 2:40:35| and you need to use a metal detector wand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| we have access to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| So we do have some metal detector capability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9641)|
| 2:40:44| currently at that high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| And we have not used it within the last six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| I don't know if we've ever used it or never used it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| but either our officers or the sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| that works out of that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9657)|
| 2:40:59| would have a handheld assigned to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| We've had six children now die from that high school, correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9662)|
| 2:41:05| in the last 12 months or six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| Is that accurate or not accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| I mean, because they died from that high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| Well, my understanding is it's five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| Five children from that high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| So how many more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9675)|
| 2:41:17| maybe before we get metal detectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| because I'm actually with the chairman on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9679)|
| 2:41:23| We're getting to a point where it's a little ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9683)|
| 2:41:25| We need to step it up a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| than just talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| And I think you heard from the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| that that is the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9693)|
| 2:41:35| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9695)|
| 2:41:45| There is a tremendous balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9705)|
| 2:41:47| that has to be held here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9707)|
| 2:41:50| I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9710)|
| 2:41:52| the more that we try to clamp down on our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| and the safer we try to make them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9716)|
| 2:41:59| the more we hear from our parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| about their kids feel like they are going to a jail every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| They're going to a prison every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9726)|
| 2:42:10| It's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9730)|
| 2:42:14| things that have been safety trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9734)|
| 2:42:18| active shooter trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| For every person that thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9741)|
| 2:42:24| that's a good thing to do with their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| you have got another person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| that thinks it is a really bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9749)|
| 2:42:32| So to say not everybody's going to be okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| or happy about whatever it is the school systems do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| and their security is an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9762)|
| 2:42:52| I've made several notes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| I tell you, this really hits a nerve with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9774)|
| 2:42:59| No deaths are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9779)|
| 2:43:01| I mean, no deaths are okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| I would like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| in the horrendous problems we've had this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9785)|
| 2:43:09| that when I say only, I do not mean only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9789)|
| 2:43:15| but one student was actually killed on the campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9795)|
| 2:43:21| in the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| Now, I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| you cannot have security that is wide enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| to cover violence off of campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9809)|
| 2:43:35| It's all we can do to handle it on campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| And when you've got entities going around the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9817)|
| 2:43:43| that have harm and violence in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9823)|
| 2:43:47| it is not going to matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9827)|
| 2:43:49| how many officers you have on that police campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9829)|
| 2:43:52| It is not going to matter how many metal detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| I'm here to tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| they cannot take responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| outside of their own school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| So that's the first thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| that I would just really like to drive home here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9844)|
| 2:44:08| Last I checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| not only were we the largest school security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9850)|
| 2:44:15| but I believe we are the 11th largest police entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9855)|
| 2:44:21| in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| Our school security is larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9863)|
| 2:44:27| than most small cities even have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| And we have that devoted strictly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9870)|
| 2:44:32| to our 88 schools and those campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9872)|
| 2:44:37| Those of you that have sat on this side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9877)|
| 2:44:46| and I've sat on the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9886)|
| 2:44:48| and have bemoaned the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9888)|
| 2:44:51| that has been asked for from County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| for schools and for our education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| I'll tell you what I bemoaned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9897)|
| 2:44:59| when I sat on the other side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| the millions and millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9901)|
| 2:45:02| that the schools had to pour into security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| and our campuses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| and new fencing and cameras| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| and everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9912)|
| 2:45:14| that the schools have already talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| that have nothing to do with direct student learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9916)|
| 2:45:20| and improving academics and excellence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9923)|
| 2:45:25| But we still as a school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| have been forced years and years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9927)|
| 2:45:28| to put millions upon millions upon millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9928)|
| 2:45:33| into our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9933)|
| 2:45:35| And it has fallen on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9935)|
| 2:45:37| it does have to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9937)|
| 2:45:39| you know, the buck starts and stops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| here at County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| And just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| when you look at the budget in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9945)|
| 2:45:47| I want you to look at the security budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9947)|
| 2:45:49| and I want you to look at how many millions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| that we are having to spend year after year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9951)|
| 2:45:54| that has nothing to do with educating our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9954)|
| 2:45:58| It's quite frankly insulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| to think that our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| are the ones that continually take the hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| and are the fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9967)|
| 2:46:09| when horrendous, horrendous actions like this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9969)|
| 2:46:13| I'm here to tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| it's real easy to sit here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| and talk about using a metal detector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| You know, we've got 60,000 kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| that go to school every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| Now, it sounds real simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9985)|
| 2:46:26| to think that you can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| one or two or three people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9988)|
| 2:46:30| standing at the door of a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9990)|
| 2:46:32| and have them walk through a detector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9992)|
| 2:46:34| or wand them every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9994)|
| 2:46:36| You know, we've got some of our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9996)|
| 2:46:38| that have got over 2,000 kids in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=9998)|
| 2:46:40| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10000)|
| 2:46:42| Somebody's got to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| You know who it falls on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| It falls on the teachers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10006)|
| 2:46:48| So, instead of them being able to do their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10008)|
| 2:46:50| if we continue to lock down like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10010)|
| 2:46:52| then it's just more and more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10012)|
| 2:46:54| and people that are taken away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10014)|
| 2:46:56| from the purpose of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10016)|
| 2:46:58| which is supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10018)|

| 2:47:02| and academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10022)|
| 2:47:09| I will just tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| it is not the school's fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10031)|
| 2:47:14| that this is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10034)|
| 2:47:16| It is not the school's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10036)|
| 2:47:19| It is a much, much bigger problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| And we have had shootings everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| unfortunately, in every setting in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| And if someone is determined enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10047)|
| 2:47:31| it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10051)|
| 2:47:34| And I really am struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10054)|
| 2:47:37| with the beating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| that our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10060)|
| 2:47:43| our superintendent and our security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| have taken over all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10065)|
| 2:47:48| When, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10068)|
| 2:47:50| it is not a school's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| It is not a school's issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10073)|
| 2:47:56| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10076)|
| 2:47:58| It is much bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10078)|
| 2:48:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10083)|
| 2:48:05| Commissioner Busley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| What was hitting me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10089)|
| 2:48:11| is when we were talking a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| we'll put metal detectors here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| locked doors here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| bells here, whistles there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10097)|
| 2:48:19| and it's not going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10099)|
| 2:48:21| to the root of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| The problem is our culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| and it's completely changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10105)|
| 2:48:27| We saw that a long time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10107)|
| 2:48:29| when you can't speak to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10109)|
| 2:48:33| properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| intelligently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| and express different ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| If you look, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| this country was built on differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10122)|
| 2:48:44| but now those differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10124)|
| 2:48:46| are used as enemies against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10126)|
| 2:48:48| If you look in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| there's not anybody the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| What makes this really great in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| is those differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| because we can grow with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| And I was taught in science one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10138)|
| 2:49:02| that nature is always starting from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| a place of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10148)|
| 2:49:11| solidarity, not solidarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10151)|
| 2:49:13| but by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| solidarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10154)|
| 2:49:19| I'm trying to express this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10159)|
| 2:49:21| in a certain way that doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| you know, you try to say things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| and it's got to me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| that I'm trying to say things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| not to infuriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10169)|
| 2:49:31| or make somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10171)|
| 2:49:33| uncomfortable or mad at me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| for what I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| But what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| is our culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10179)|
| 2:49:41| our families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10181)|
| 2:49:42| trying to do everything we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| to make the kids in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10184)|
| 2:49:47| feel like prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10187)|
| 2:49:49| when they go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10189)|
| 2:49:51| And if the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| in those areas where those schools are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| that are having the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10195)|
| 2:49:57| will not come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| and support the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10199)|
| 2:50:01| and we don't do these rush to judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10201)|
| 2:50:03| every time that something happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| and we start blaming everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| for the lack of our commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| to the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| then we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| we're still not addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| the root of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10216)|
| 2:50:18| And it's not the guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10218)|
| 2:50:20| It's the culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| in which we live in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10222)|
| 2:50:26| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10226)|
| 2:50:28| we go from order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| to disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10230)|
| 2:50:32| That's the nature of what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| and that's what nature is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10234)|
| 2:50:36| It always is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| You go from order to disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10238)|
| 2:50:41| And I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10241)|
| 2:50:43| we just can't deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| with the disorder anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10245)|
| 2:50:47| that we're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10247)|
| 2:50:49| We can't accept others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10249)|
| 2:50:51| as who they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10251)|
| 2:50:53| and what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10253)|
| 2:50:55| and you don't want to listen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| to somebody else's ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10257)|
| 2:50:59| And my ideas are old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10259)|
| 2:51:01| but I grew up to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10261)|
| 2:51:03| everybody would listen to each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10263)|
| 2:51:05| and everybody worked together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10267)|
| 2:51:08| to make the schools better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10268)|
| 2:51:10| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10270)|
| 2:51:12| unless we address the root of the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10272)|
| 2:51:14| we can put all the things we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10274)|
| 2:51:16| We can put metal bars around everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10276)|
| 2:51:18| for those kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10278)|
| 2:51:19| but it's not going to cure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10279)|
| 2:51:21| the problems we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10281)|
| 2:51:23| Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10283)|
| 2:51:26| I defer to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| I'll go after him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10288)|
| 2:51:29| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10291)|
| 2:51:32| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10292)|
| 2:51:33| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10293)|
| 2:51:36| I think Russ or Gus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10296)|
| 2:51:38| hit the nail on the head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10298)|
| 2:51:40| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10300)|
| 2:51:42| it's relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| When you're at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| I go to the South Knoxville schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| I don't go to the other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| and I should,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10312)|
| 2:51:53| but I concentrate on my South schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| The relationships that are built there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| between our officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10318)|
| 2:52:00| our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10320)|
| 2:52:01| and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10321)|
| 2:52:03| I've been taught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10323)|
| 2:52:05| at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10325)|
| 2:52:07| got a part-time job there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210419?start=10327)|
