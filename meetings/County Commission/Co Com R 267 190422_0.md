| 0:03:19| which is a deferred discussion and possible action against beer permittees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| that are delinquent in paying their annual beer privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| Specifically, this was driven by item A, which is the Fraternal Order of Eagles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| which came before this body, I think, at last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| I'm seeing, is that your light, Commissioner Daley? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Is there any discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Are they here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=225)|

| 0:03:52| If you could please approach the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| and state your name and address for the record if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=235)|

| 0:04:41| My address is 200 O'Leary Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| I think you're here before us around the delinquency related to the beer taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| so I'm going to go ahead and pass this to the Law Department to review the alleged offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=297)|

| 0:05:08| against you or the clerk in this case because I think you have a failure to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| And at that point in time, if there's anything left that you'd like to say before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=315)|

| 0:06:08| If you'd like to make any additional follow-up statement to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=368)|

| 0:06:22| I'd like to make a motion we reinstate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| It'll be your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=385)|

| 0:06:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| I just would like to acknowledge to see if he understands maybe what occurred in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| or if it was tardy, what the procedure is so that they can avoid it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| I mean, you know, sometimes stuff just gets lost that we can just add that if you see that notice again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| that you won't be before us in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| Sometimes we need to just make sure people understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| Do you understand the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| I mean, it seems like just the bottom line is the bill's got missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Yes, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=434)|

| 0:07:27| And when she did, I came up and paid the taxes and got it taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Okay. All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=452)|

| 0:09:47| At Weigel's, we do understand it is a privilege to sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| and it is our responsibility to make sure that we have employees that are trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| and understand that policy and card appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| I do have a handout that really goes through, if the board would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| what we do on a regular basis to try and ensure we don't have these things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| And we certify everybody in new employee training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| so when they come through orientation they're certified before they enter the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| Our POS system, we have to put in a birth date on any age-restricted product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=620)|
| 0:10:25| and as long as they put in the appropriate date, then it will deny that sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| We do internal compliance checks within our stores on a fairly regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| usually every 60 to 90 days, and that's every store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| And then we do ongoing training every 90 days where we send out a training packet to our stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| Managers go over our age-restricted policy and have every associate sign that and send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=645)|
| 0:10:51| Although those are very important, I think what's probably more important is what we've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| to ensure that we don't have instances like we had at our Heart and Valley store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| where it's happened to us twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| And we've made some changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| We have obviously, when we do have an issue, we terminate that individual that did sell alcohol to the minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=666)|
| 0:11:15| which we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| So Stephen Borges was terminated immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| We have went through some management changes at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| and we've put a different manager in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| The previous manager has left us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| This manager is a 15-year veteran, so she managed both our stores in Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| among some other stores, for a long period of time, been with us 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| very policy-oriented and someone that we rest assured we feel good about her being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| write some of the issues in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| We immediately retrain everybody in the location, so we've sent them through retraining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| We'll do the update training not only in that store but in all our stores every 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| probably at least for the next six to nine months to ensure that everybody understands the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| and how to react to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| We just recently went back and did our own internal compliance checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| and we will run those every 30 days for the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| We do that usually on an annually basis around prom and graduation time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| and we do it during major holidays to help keep it front of mind for all our associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| But we have put that program in place and we have stepped that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| We have also put into effect a program where we have our district managers on certain high-volume days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=753)|
| 0:12:41| on a weekly basis, will call each and every location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| They'll call the location in the morning and they'll call it in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| They'll talk to every associate that is on duty at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| and review our age-restricted policy on carding folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| So we've just got to backstep, and it's an embarrassment for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=774)|
| 0:13:00| and it's unacceptable for us just as it is this board and the community and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| And so we're going to backstep, make sure we have all our people understand our policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| what's right and what's wrong, and that we will not sell to underage, anyone underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| So that's where we sit at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Mr. Law Director, if you could refresh this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| It's been a while since we've had a second-time offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| What is the, I don't know, the first was 1,000 or was it the first 1,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| Do you know, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Well, you all left the rules before and you started off with 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| It used to be 500, and then you went to 1,000, and then you started with 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| Now you go to 1,500, then two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| I think it's the way you were doing it, but I honestly don't recall them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| So what is the rule of state on the second offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| The second offense was a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| But practice has been different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Yeah, we've upped that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| In practice, you go $1,500 and 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| I think you jump to the third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| I'd like to make a motion that we assess a fine of $1,500 or a 60-day suspension up to the vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=850)|
| 0:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| There's a motion on the floor to do a $1,500 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| Is there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| There's a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Is there any discussion on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| I know, Commissioner Schoonmaker, I can hear you talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| I thought when we did the second time within basically a year and a half where it's been pretty recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=875)|
| 0:14:44| that it was 60 days or a $2,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| Does anybody recall that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=893)|
| 0:15:01| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| County Clerk, can you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| I overheard you mention that you thought you could remember exactly in recent history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| We have had varying ways of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| It depends on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| And we have had the 2,060 days or it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| I think there were variables of whether they checked the ID and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| I'll keep it the same, just to be on the safe side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Is there any additional discussion on this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=939)|
| 0:15:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| So, sir, you've got a choice of a $1,500 fine or a 60-day revocation of your beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| What is your choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| We would pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| You've got seven days to pay the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| To the Knox County Clerk's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Is there any additional discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| We appreciate the steps that you've taken to help address all of the concerns that you've had on your second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| Those are quite impressive to make sure that you're not standing before us again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| Those are really good efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| This is not any place we like to be, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| So we don't want to be here any more than you all want us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| So we want to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| The next item on our agenda is Item 6B, A1 Discount Tobacco, 2511 East Governor John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=996)|
| 0:16:44| Alan James Armstrong is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| This is another second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| The first offense was on March of 2018 in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1008)|
| 0:16:56| Sir, if you could approach and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| Alan James Armstrong, 4603 East Governor John Sevier Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Mr. Lauda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| You've seen our procedures here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| We'll have the officer come and take testimony before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| You'll have an opportunity to affirm or deny and to give your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| At this time, I'll call Lieutenant Cole to the stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1041)|
| 0:17:32| Lean a little closer to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| This is part of our underage file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| So officers on the same day, 3-20, went into 2511 East Governor John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1057)|
| 0:17:45| and they purchased a can of alcohol, I believe it was margarita, something to do with margarita,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1065)|
| 0:17:57| with an underage buyer also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Mr. Armstrong, do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Do you have an opportunity to express your position to this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| I can assure you we're doing everything we can do to keep this from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| I got all the tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| I sent the girl to the class last year so this wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| All I can do is tell them, tell them, tell them not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| I got the little card and I'm doing everything I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| That's all I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| You've just seen the process before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| This committee will debate the appropriate action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| A question for Mr. Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Do we, do you all have on your point of sale where they have to put in the date of birth to sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| I mean you're the, the only thing you sell is two of your main items are alcohol and tobacco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| which require an age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Is that in your point of service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| No, I still got the punch register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| Don't have the scan system or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Still got the old school punch register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| I just have a question about first events, second events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| When does, when, if somebody has a second event, when does that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| if they paid a fine and they've done their time, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| when does that reset back to, or is it a perpetual thing as long as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| It would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| So if they have no violations on three years, they sort of go back to zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1170)|
| 0:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| Is there any other questions from the, from the Board of Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| I mean, I don't want to be too preachy to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| but, you know, you're in the tobacco business and the booze business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| and it's just a little bit surprising that you haven't got an automated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| point of sale system to help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| I mean, I just, you know, here we are, we're probably going to fine you for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| and, you know, in the future that might save you and save a life by looking at a system such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1193)|
| 0:20:02| So I guess the Chair will entertain a motion to take an action on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| seeing that there's no additional lights for discussion matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Commissioner Beeler, he's in your district, if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| I would move the same as Commissioner Anders did in the last case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| a fine of $1,500 or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Okay, to restate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Commissioner Beeler has proposed a fine of $1,500 or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| That's your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Second from Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| You've heard you've got the choice of either a $1,500 fine or a 60-day revocation of your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| Which one do you choose, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| I'll take the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| You choose the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| May the record reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| You've got seven days to make the payment to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Go ahead, Mr. Dren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Point of privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Mr. Armstrong, I would, you know, if you come back up here for a third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| it's generally a suspension with no choice of fine usually or can be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| I would take some measure to rectify maybe your point of sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| other than just saying I've done all I can do because it becomes, that falls on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| We had that issue in another supermarket, and I told him, this was years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| but I told him, I said, if you don't straighten up, you won't have a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| And I think the nonchalantness of, you know, the two main things that you sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| and with the point of sale system that as simple as, I mean, that $1,500 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| you could probably have bought you a point of sale system that will require a date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| So I would consider that in your business decisions later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| I think that's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| So move on and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Let's get this fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| We do not want to see you here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Next item on our agenda is Item 6C, the Rocky Top Market, 915 308 Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| Dunn Manning Stores, LLC, is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| This is a first offense from District 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| If you could please step forward and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| Victoria Morris, 308 East Emory Road, Powell, Tennessee, 37849, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| And you as well, ma'am, you've approached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| I'm Diane Pearson, a corporate trainer, compliance monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| Okay. I notice this has got a LLC ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| I guess is it Dunn or Dunn Manning Stores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Are both of you all representatives of the LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Is that what we've got here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| You've seen the procedure here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I will be calling the officer up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| He will testify to the allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| You'll have an opportunity to affirm or deny those allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| You'll have an opportunity to tell this board your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| At this time, I'll call Lieutenant Cole to the stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| On 320 also, we did go in the business and purchase a can of alcohol with an underage buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1388)|
| 0:23:20| Okay. The law enforcement has stated now is the time for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| if you'd like to make a statement on your own related to that alleged offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| Do you confirm or deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| May the record reflect that they affirmed the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| And now do you have a statement you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1419)|
| 0:23:44| So we have, since this, we have retrained everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| We've had team meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| We do, whenever someone's first hired, we have alcohol training the first day, the top shelf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| and then hands-on training for the first five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| The employee that did this was a new hire, so he also got retrained on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1441)|
| 0:24:09| We are having monthly team meetings now to make sure that it gets addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| Sorry, I'm nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Just make sure everything gets addressed and that they put in the birthday correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| and how important it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| He basically got distracted by someone else in line making jokes, laughing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| and I have addressed how important it is to focus and to enter the birthday correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1469)|
| 0:24:37| The system is set up to reject a cell if the birthday is put in and it's under age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| We also have the scanners for the IDs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Yeah, I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Any commissioners have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| Okay, as you've seen how things work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Okay, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| I listened to both of you all that said that you had to show that you have something to scan the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| to make sure it was, and was this overridden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| He didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| He did take the ID in hand and looked at it, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| he was distracted and did not type in the correct birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| There's no excuse for that, which is why the training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| and he has been disciplined and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| But while I'm training again about how important it is to not only use the scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| but also to look at the correct birthday and enter it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| This is kind of important since you're close to the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| and they would be going on the interstate and this is alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| I'm going to make a recommendation that we do a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| but that being that close to the interstate, I would hate to see you all back up here a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1572)|

| 0:26:15| I've always had a store right next to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| This is my first expense with any of the stores I've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| This was just a big oversight, and I will do everything in my power to correct it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1581)|

| 0:27:23| It's 8001 Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Verit, Inc., is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| This is a first offense from District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1647)|

| 0:27:33| Verit, if you could just state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| and verify that you're with the corporate ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1656)|

| 0:27:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| You're representing the corporation tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| You've seen our procedures here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| We'll bring the law enforcement officer up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| He will make a statement of allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| You'll have an opportunity to affirm or deny that allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| You'll have an opportunity to testify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| and to give your side of the story to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| I'll call the officer up at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Lieutenant Cole, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| On 320, officers did an underage buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| and they were able to purchase a, I believe it was a 20-ounce Bud Light in a can at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1707)|
| 0:28:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| I affirm, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| You have an opportunity at this time to give your side of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| It was just my second day, and we had some things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| Our credit card machine was down, and I did see his ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| but I did see his birth date for the tobacco, not for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| It was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| So it was just the second day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| And I never sold alcohol before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| I did see his ID, but I did it for the tobacco instead of the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Just to restate and to confirm what you said, so this was the second day you all were open, the second day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| and I've just got a note from the law department that this is your second day of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| when this alleged offense took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| Have you all done any server training or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| I did take the training, the beer class training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Do you actually manage the cash register yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| I've got a few other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Do you have any additional statements then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| And by the way, I guess we'd like to know if you affirm or deny this allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| I see I've got a couple of commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| There was one light over here, but Commissioner Carringer has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Commissioner Carringer, if you could go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| Yeah, I remember you very well, and that's when I was looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| I thought we just issued a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| What was the actual, was it February or was it that long ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| It was February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| The permit was written March 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| The violation was March 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| So it was the day after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Yeah, that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| So you're the owner of the store, but you lease the building, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| So I knew right away when I saw the address before I even got here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| I thought I'm pretty sure we just issued that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| And then when I saw you, I remembered you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| So how many employees do you have working here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| We don't have any employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| It's just myself and my husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| And that's all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| And you're open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| And the reason why, and I'm not trying to take away from Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| but mine and his district back right up to each other, and I pass by here every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| So it's very troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| Our roads are bad out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| And, of course, I was shocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| I was shocked to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| How many days a week and hours are you all open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| Just the two of you are doing this and still operating it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| Yes, seven days a week from 630 to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| And as far as your cash register and your verification, do you have any scanners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| Do you have anything where you put in the date, birth date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| You and your husband both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Or have you both gone through Top Shelf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| And you had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| I thought you said you had when you came the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| You had already been through Top Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| I did, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| Well, I'm going to defer this over to Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| But it's very troubling to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| And at the same time, due to this is your livelihood, I'm kind of at a loss of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1937)|
| 0:32:27| I mean, I don't think as long as I've been on here I've ever seen one like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| But somehow before we go any further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| we need to make sure that you fully understand what's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| and what has happened so that it doesn't happen anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| I was just trying to think in four and a half years of serving on this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| I do not believe I've ever had the owner of an establishment cited for selling beer underage in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| And whatever we decide to do, we need to make this very severe because that's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1984)|
| 0:33:14| The owner of a store would do that within the first week of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2004)|
| 0:33:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I don't think this is any more severe than any other cases that we've seen today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| Anybody who's ever started a business knows how chaotic it is for the first six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| much less the first six days or two days of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| And I think it says a lot that the owner would come and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| I made a mistake, I'm sorry, and I'm going to work better to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| This seems to be a dedicated family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| and I would make a motion to treat this the same way as we have other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| with a first offense fine of $1,000 or a 30-day revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2039)|
| 0:34:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| The motion was made by Commissioner Jay, with the second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Just a point of, it can't be a revocation, it has to be a suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| Revocation is property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Pardon me, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Seeing none, all in favor of this, excuse me, yes, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| Do you have the proper measures as well to scan and everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Have you been properly trained in those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| I know sometimes, since you're a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| I'm sorry, sir, I could not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Have you been properly trained to scan the IDs and use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Yeah, like I said, I did check the ID, but I did it for tobacco instead of the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| It was my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Have you ever worked in a facility like this before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| So you're new to the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| It was just the second day and never sold the beer or tobacco before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| This item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| All right, ma'am, you've got a choice of either a $1,000 fine or to have your license suspended for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2124)|
| 0:35:32| Which do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| We'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| You'll pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| You have seven days to pay the fine, and we do not want to see you in front of this body again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| In all my time on this board, I don't think I've ever seen something happen right out of the gates like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| So please, for the safety of our community, tighten it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| Yeah, I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Mr. Chairman, Deborah is from Metro Drug Coalition back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| Ma'am, would you care to meet with her afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2165)|
| 0:36:13| I just wanted to make sure that some things were truly understood right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Commissioner Biggs, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Lieutenant Cole, we have four violations today, and I guess we are in prom season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2190)|
| 0:36:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| Are we in prom season now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| How many attempted purchases were made during this time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| Right at 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| Right at 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| We had a lull in the transition of beer stings, and I appreciate you doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| I know it's not the most glamorous of assignments, and I appreciate you doing it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| It's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2228)|
| 0:37:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Whenever we meet again for the next time at the next beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| can we meet and maybe speak about some of the fines and getting this for sure dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| I think $1,500 is a little less than it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| On a second offense, especially like Commissioner Smith just stated right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| at this point in time with prom and graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| I would like to see it be higher throughout the entire year for second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| Anything like rules or guidelines that we might be able to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| I think ultimately these things are all completely up to this body to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| to use our judgment on how we're going to rule on fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| We can review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| I know there are kind of guidelines within our codes that we've been using and basing our decisions on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| where they've got sort of a floor, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| It is within the realm of this body at perhaps one of our next meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| where we might have a shorter agenda to discuss historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| I might ask the clerk's office to help us pull together kind of the history of our fines for an upcoming future meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2288)|
| 0:38:15| I'll use some judgment looking at how big of an agenda that we have to add that as a discussion item for this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Mr. Lauderegger, can we change the dollar amount due to the season?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Or do we just have to stick to a specific dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| The fines that were used in the past were based upon the preferred vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| and it is a total discretion of this board whether you fine, whether you suspend, or whether you revoke under any level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| So the only thing that I would recommend is that you be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| and that you be fair to each and every person at the same level with the same type charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| Okay. Thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Is there any other business that needs to come before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Okay. The chair will entertain a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| All right. Motion by Commissioner Daley. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| Second by Commissioner Biggs. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| All right. All opposed? Okay. We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| Good afternoon, and welcome to the April meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| I'm sure we have some guests either here that you might be attending your first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| and we might have some folks who may be watching this meeting from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| I want to thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| I also want to let you know a little bit about the meeting before we go into our actual agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| Last week at county commission, the commission met to begin the formalization of tonight's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| So if you stay with us through the entire meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| you'll find that we've got several items for both the school board and for general commission business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| that we will vote together as part of a consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| So the clerk's office will read them into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| It will be hopefully a good meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| We've got a lot of important topics to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| And once again, we want to thank you for joining us at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| Before we begin, I'd like to ask the clerk's office to have a roll call of all commissioners who are in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2409)|

| 0:40:39| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| I'd like to call on Commissioner Daly to lead us in tonight's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| I'd like to introduce Pastor Buddy Johnson from Stock Creek Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Come on up, Buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| A little history about Stock Creek Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| Stock Creek Baptist is one of the oldest Baptist churches in our area, having been established in 1791.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| To Tennessee before it officially became a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Various records throughout the years reveal that the church has been known as many names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| The Pioneer Church, called Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| The Primitive Baptist Church of Jesus Christ at Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| And the current name, Stock Creek Baptist Church, was adopted in 1806| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| when the congregation became the earliest members of the fledgling Tennessee Baptist Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| The church has a history that has been clearly centered on Jesus Christ, the word of God, the gospel, and abiding concern for the lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| Pastor Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| I'm honored to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| I am very thankful for what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Just kind of watching from the wings and being here a few moments early and just kind of seeing how you work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| You have a big task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| You have a lot of entities and individuals that come in with all kinds of agendas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| and you've got to weed through all that prayerfully and with your wisdom and whatever else you can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2510)|
| 0:41:56| Figure out a way to do what is best for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| But what if after you did all of that, you invested all of your blood, your sweat, your tears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| which I know you do in working hard to try to help our county move smoothly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| what if everybody just went ahead and did whatever the heck they wanted to do anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| You might feel like they do that sometimes anyway, but what if that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| There would be chaos, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| Just utter chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| And I would imagine, too, that after that blood, sweat, and tears had been poured out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| that you might feel a little insulted, that you might be a little down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| Well, imagine this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| God poured out the blood, sweat, tears, and life of his son Jesus Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| that he might bring order to our world and that he might give us his wisdom to know how to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| In the Bible there was a time when it said that everyone did what was right in their own eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2569)|
| 0:42:55| And as you can imagine, there was chaos that ensued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2575)|
| 0:42:59| There was no king. There was no government. There was no order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| And so everybody just kind of did whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| And it resulted in wickedness and evil and pain and sorrow and dissension, chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| But there was also some times that were even worse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| not just when the people did what was right in their own eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| but when the king did what was right in his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| When the government, instead of following the will and the wisdom of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| did what was right in its own eyes, and those times were even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| Some people would say that where we live now is a time of unrest, even chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| If you watch the news, probably a bad idea anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| but if you watch the news, you see a lot of political, social, moral unrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| people seeming to do just what they want to do and not concerned about others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| and the pain and the sorrow and the suffering that comes with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| And so it is a very unique time in our history of unrest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| But you and I, commissioners, pastors, every one of us, we have a unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| And the question is, whose idea of right, whose idea of wisdom will we depend on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| Will it be our own? Will we lean on how we were raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| hoping our parents did a good job and they gave us the right kind of ideas about how to live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Will it be our education, our intellect, our own intuition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| How will we do that? Or will it be something higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| There is a God. That is evident in creation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| The Bible tells us that His power and order are visible even in creation, but even more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| He revealed in His Word His perfect character and His infinite wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2679)|
| 0:44:45| And so we all need to ask questions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Why are we here? And who placed us here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Why am I a pastor? Why are you a commissioner? How did you get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| Who put you in this place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| And by whose wisdom will you do well for those who have been entrusted to your charge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2697)|
| 0:45:06| Well, from my standpoint, and I guess this would be obvious because I'm a Christian pastor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| it would be the God of the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| First of all, you must know Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| The Bible makes that pretty plain how that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| We are all born as lawbreakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| You guys would be deeply insulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| If everybody just ignores your rules and your laws, and there would be consequence, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| There was a gentleman here, a police officer earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| He used to uphold those laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| If laws are broken, there must be consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| And we have all broken the laws of God and in so doing broken His heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| And the Bible tells us this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Instead of us having to face that punishment, Jesus Christ came and He died on the cross in our place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2740)|
| 0:45:45| He took the punishment that our lawbreaking deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| And He made a way that for every man, woman, boy, and girl who would turn away from their sin of their self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| and trust Him by faith that they could be forgiven and have life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| And so second, would you know Him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| First, would you know Him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| Second, would you seek Him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| It's easy to go through life trusting in our own strength, our own power, our own wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| My goodness, I cannot imagine all that you all have to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| And it would be really easy just to fall back on your habits, your intuition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| the advice of maybe trusted friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| But will you seek the wisdom of God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| And then when He reveals it to you, because the Bible is really clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2782)|
| 0:46:25| for those who seek Him, they will find Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| He is not a God who disguises Himself or hides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| He is a God who is waiting for those who are willing to turn away from their own ways and trust in Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| He is waiting to embrace them with His love and His grace and His mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| And I call upon you, all of us, me as a pastor, you as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| to remember, to trust in the wisdom and the power and the grace of God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| We just came through the Easter season, and we celebrate the death of Christ, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| but on Easter what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| The fact that He conquered death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| If He can handle death, He can sure handle Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| And He can handle the lives of you and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| Will we invite Him in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| Psalm 24, starting in verse 7, says this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| Lift up your heads, O you gates, and be lifted up, you everlasting doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| and the King of glory shall come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| Who is this King of glory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| The Lord, strong and mighty, the Lord, mighty in battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Lift up your heads, O you gates, and lift them up, you everlasting doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| and the King of glory shall come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| Who is this King of glory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| The Lord of hosts, He is the King of glory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2861)|
| 0:47:42| Heavenly Father, thank you for an absolutely beautiful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Thank you for the life that you give us, the opportunity we have to live and to love and to be loved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2866)|
| 0:47:52| But thank you most of all for the incredible sacrifice that you made for our sin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| that through you we could find forgiveness in life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| Lord, we admit to you that in our world there is chaos, unrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2880)|
| 0:48:04| and there is self-centeredness in all of the things, God, that come from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| Lord, help us to trust in your wisdom, to lean not on our own understanding but on yours and your word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| and to find in that, God, the beauty and grace and peace that you promised to all who will trust in you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| It's in Jesus' name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Amen, and thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Thank you, Commissioner Daly, for bringing him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2912)|
| 0:48:33| Next on our agenda is Commissioner Justin Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| who will lead all of us in a pledge of allegiance to our nation's flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| If everyone would rise and salute the flag, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| Okay, my fellow commissioners, I'm going to just move a couple of little things around on our traditional agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| At this point, we usually go into public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| but I've got a few folks who have asked to speak at public forum that are related to items that are actually on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2950)|
| 0:49:18| So what I'm going to propose is I'm going to jump right now into item number F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| to propose that we set our agenda before we go into public forum, and then we will go into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| So if you're taking notes, my fellow commissioners and to the clerk's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| we have just to confirm what's before you is item number 27 will be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2975)|
| 0:49:47| Item number 36 is going to be deferred to May, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2987)|
| 0:49:57| Yeah, I can confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| I'll verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| Yeah, okay, that's confirmed that it has been deferred to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| Also, as it relates to public forum, I know that I've got one public forum person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| Tanner, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| All right, Tanner's requested to speak about the CAT ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| What I would propose, Tanner, if that's okay with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| is to speak to that when we get to that item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| With that said, I'm going to move that item from what was at the very back of our agenda towards the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3028)|
| 0:50:35| Additionally, item 44, which is similar to an opportunity to recognition resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3035)|
| 0:50:43| that's towards the back of our agenda, and I know we have quite a few folks here to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| So I'm going to move that after honorary resolution number one, we will then move on to item 44 and then item 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3048)|
| 0:50:59| And that will have Tanner moving off of the public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| and will speak when we get to that item towards the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| Are there any other changes or additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| I'd just like to make sure that item D, the honorary resolution, staff had everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| These young men from Bearden were actually out of school today and I'm sure they don't want to sit here on their day off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| That will be the first item that we'll get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| We've got a public forum and there will be three folks that will speak at public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| and then we'll get to the honorary resolutions and they'll be number one on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| Yes, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| If you remember at the workshop I asked that I would have one of my items deferred to this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3094)|
| 0:51:42| so it wouldn't be slated if you could move it to the front because we have the employees here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| That was related to Parks and Rec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| We'll do that as well for item 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| Madam Clerk, are you keeping track of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| Yes, that would be good because I know that that rec one, Commissioner Busler, that one's been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| We've been trying to get that one on the agenda for several months if I recall correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| Are there any other proposed changes to tonight's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Is there a motion to accept tonight's agenda as proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| That's moved by Commissioner Gill and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3148)|
| 0:52:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| I'd like to introduce some employees that I've brought with me, and you'll understand in a second why I have asked them to come to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| And if you all would stand as I call your name, Richard Major, Karen Frost, Lisa Frazier, Robin Lovell, Amy Dearing, Casey Plemons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3169)|
| 0:52:58| Trish Graybeal, Monica Johnson, April Jones, Latrinda Green, Vicki Wood, Stacey Olfey, and Missy Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| And you all can be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| These folks represent our financial group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| Some of them are members of our call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| They answered over 100,000 phone calls last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| They stay busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| We disperse $15 million that we collect through various and sundry means, and we distribute them to 87 different agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| We also work with individuals who come in and do payment plans, and we do that on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| As we were meeting with Chris Caldwell last year, talking about the excess fees, he gave us a very aggressive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| And so I got together with these folks behind me who just stood and developed a plan for how we were going to meet this aggressive number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3217)|
| 0:53:45| I will tell you that the number that Chris Caldwell gave us was $1,250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| And I'm here to say that we are not giving you $1,250,000 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3232)|
| 0:53:59| Rather, because I have the best clerks on the planet, I'm here today to present to you a check for $1,300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3239)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3248)|
| 0:54:18| There is a reason why we have gotten the extra $50,000, and the reason is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| In our Fourth Circuit, we see domestic violence every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| We see the results of domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| We work closely with the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| One of the things that we have learned is that last year, 1,478 children under the age of 15 came to the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Now, the research is clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| If you have 1,478 children who have seen or been the victims of domestic violence, there is a chance they themselves will become abusers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3283)|
| 0:54:52| and they themselves will perpetrate domestic violence on people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| One of the things that the Family Justice Center is proposing and is already working on is a program that is entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| Services that Empower Survivors and Their Children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| We have a heart in our office for these kids, as well as the victims who come to our office every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| So I'm going to be coming back to you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| I'm going to be asking you to take that $50,000 extra that we have given you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| Of course, it's your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| You can do whatever you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| But we're going to give you reasons why we think that this would be a good investment in our community for the Family Justice Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| So, again, thank you for the opportunity of seeing you, and I will see you again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| Criminal Court Clerk Mr. Hammond, I just want to personally applaud you and your great staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3340)|
| 0:55:50| I brought my annual report that was mailed to us, and I know this took a lot of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| but I just wonder if our Knox County people know all the different things that you all are doing to not only doing your job here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3355)|
| 0:56:07| but what you're doing to help the community and raise funds and awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3367)|
| 0:56:14| Alzheimer's is one of your offices, one of the things that you all promote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| And this was wow, is all I could say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3382)|
| 0:56:27| This was wow coming from a Knox County office holder and their office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| And this wasn't about the stuff you all were doing and your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| This was stuff that you were doing to make a difference in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| So thank you to all of you great employees of Knox County and for representing this office very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| Thank you so much. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| While I've got the floor to recognize other public officials, I'd like to thank Mayor Jacobs for joining us at County Commission tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3410)|
| 0:56:57| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Would you like to address Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Okay. That's coming up real soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Also, we have Sheriff Tom Spangler, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| I haven't seen Tom, but Commissioner Carringer told me that Sheriff Spangler was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| He was in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| He's checking on our food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| In case you don't know, we're catered by the jail downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| It's good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| And Nick McBride from the Register of Deeds office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Thank you, Nick, for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| And I want to thank and recognize my old friend from elementary school days, Mr. Charlie Susano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3448)|
| 0:57:34| Thank you, Charlie, for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| And Super Bob Thomas, our school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| Thank all of you for joining us at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| Next, and are there any other elected officials that I've failed to recognize or haven't seen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| Sherry. Okay. Sherry Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Thank you, Sherry, for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Now, moving back on to public forum, Mr. Vance Sherwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| Is Vance here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| If you could step forward and please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Yeah. Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| My name is Vance Sherwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| I live in the county at Belmena Way, and I practice psychology here in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| And I'm here to offer some complaints about the county jail and detention centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3489)|
| 0:58:14| and to complain about the conditions there and to ask for some remedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| at least for you guys to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Specifically, what I'm talking about is the contract that the county entered into four to five years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| with Securus Corporation, which, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| is a private firm that makes its money out of providing services to jails and prisons across the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| The reason that that's of concern to me is that one of the ways they make their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| is not just to offer their services to the county, but they also sell services to the inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3521)|
| 0:58:49| And I think those are services that should be provided by the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| For example, I can assure you that the food you're about to get from the jail downstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| bears no relationship or visual resemblance to the food that the inmates get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| If you want a diet that's worth anything, you're going to have to supplement it with food from the commissary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| which you can pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| In addition, if you want to contact with your family or your friends, you can do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| but not face to face or in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| You can pay for that, too, through a video call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Or if you want to e-mail anybody in the outside world, you can do that, but you can pay for that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| You can even pay for a postcard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| And for that matter, and this is the best part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| if your family sends you some money so that you can do any of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| they will actually charge you a fee out of that money that's been sent to you to manage the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| And I guess I should call that a mismanagement fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| because if you happen to be moved to another facility from the Knox County Jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| that money will not be following you, at least it never has to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| Now, the reason that concerns me is that these are the people who the inmates in the jail are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| for the most part, among the poorest and most vulnerable people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| You're vulnerable if you're in the jail because, well, you're in the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| And you're the poorest if you're in the jail because the reason you're in the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| the vast majority of the folks in the detention centers in Knox County have not been convicted of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| They're there because they can't afford bail, which is, by definition, to say that they are poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| So in this debtor's prison that we run here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| you have people who are given inadequate diets and even no access to their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| and who are asked to pay for everything from those items to having money to be managed or mismanaged, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3621)|
| 1:00:29| Now, one of those things that concerns me the most is the visitation business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| I mentioned that you don't have face-to-face visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| What you have is the privilege of paying for a video call with your family, which, incidentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| this system breaks down quite a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| And if it breaks down, you're not going to get your money back, or at least, again, nobody ever has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| That should be of concern to us because in research, and if any of you guys would like to see the research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| if you'll give me your e-mail address, I can send you one, five, ten, 15, 20, 25 articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| summarizing the role of family visitation on recidivism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Visitation from the family lowers recidivism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| The absence of visitation raises it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| Now, if you're paying for your contact through a video phone call, and if you're poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| that means that you're not going to be having too much contact with your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| And when you do have contact with your family, they're going to be irritated with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| because you're costing them money they don't have, and eventually that's going to dry up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| which means that you're going to lose visitation with your family and contact, which, in turn, increases recidivism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| Finally, I want to mention conditions at the county jail and detention centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| The jails have been overcrowded for at least the last year over census, and they are chronically understaffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| Now, you'd think that understaffing would not be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| because Securus is handling a number of the functions for the jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| but the present sheriff and the past sheriff have not been able to keep the staff up to snuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| And you know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| If you have overcrowding and not enough staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| then you're going to have people unable to get out of their cells for the one hour a day that they're promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| so that they can get to the library or the law library or so that they can exercise or get some sunlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| And you know what else is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| There's going to be an increase in violence between prisoners and violence between staff and prisoners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| and the sheriff's own statistics confirm that that is, in fact, the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| So there are some things you pay for, the food, the contact with your family, having your money managed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| but there are some things that are free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| And what's free is being stuck in your cell 24 hours a day, and it's an overcrowded cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And what's also free is the violence between the prisoners and between you and the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| I don't believe that these are proper things for, well, I don't think they're proper things at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| My Bible is against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I suspect yours is, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| But in addition to that, this is just not the way that Tennesseans ought to run their government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| and it's not what I think of as Tennessee government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| I mean, it's not like we're in Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| And I believe that you guys should consider changing these policies and remedying these defects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| Thank you very much for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Next is Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| Constance, if you're here, I'm sorry if I pronounced your last name wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3792)|
| 1:03:22| Go ahead and just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Yes, my name is Constance Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| My address is 301 North Chihuahua Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| I have a nonprofit called Sleeves for Needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Actually, I'm going to piggyback off some of the very things that he talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| You know, it's ironic that the pastor came here today talking about the principles of our biblical beliefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3819)|
| 1:03:45| and how these are supposed to be reflections that we carry over into our daily lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| and our daily activities of existence, interactions with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| as well as the general public and people that we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| It's a standard of kindness that we're supposed to present to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| However, you know, the irony is that this government has failed in so many areas of such principles and standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| Obviously, one of the prime examples that's just left out of here is that our Knox County Jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3845)|
| 1:04:09| We already know that that has been an ongoing issue and concern of some of the various things that he already has discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| My next biggest thing is that, of course, there are some issues with Knox County's school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| I am going to continue to bring this man's name up, Latronis D. Rowans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| I'm going to continue to talk about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| No, you don't get to interrupt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| So, anyways, I'm going to continue to bring his name up because, as it has already been stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| as it has been, you all just complimented the Family Justice Center for outstanding work, efforts, and jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| Ma'am, we're not here just to bring this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| We'd prefer for this forum just to give us advice, but we're not here to bring up people and just, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| He's a sexual predator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| We're going to continue to bring that up until people do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| We were just here, like, Wednesday, reporting a complaint with the mayor and the governor's office of the continued sexual predator behavior he currently has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3890)|
| 1:04:58| as well as the fact I have a witness from Cat Bus Station that saw him standing outside waiting for myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| and another person that came to file those complaints together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| So, clearly, that means someone here knew we were here and contacted him to tell him that for him to even be outside even waiting for us in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| Even now, this is considered harassment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Why are you standing over my shoulder and doing all these different things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| Tom, could you have one of your guys come in, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| One thing we're not going to do here is you approaching the podium while she's speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| I've properly recognized her in the context of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| Ma'am, you know, it's appropriate to provide us with advice and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Take him off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| That's the advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Get him off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| He is threatening our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I just threatened Demarcus Lewis, who is a junior from Fulton High School, on Wednesday morning, 8 a.m., to be exact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| I have the transcripts and feed that I turned over to appropriate authorities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| It's not a secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| It's been ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| I'm trying to figure out why you all have neglected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| Why is this not something of concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| Why is it not an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Is it because it's happening in the lower income community to the black students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| Is that why we have been ignoring it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Is this a proper standard of behavior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| You talk about recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| You have a county commissioner that said Harry Willis cost us $93,000 in a lawsuit for misconduct and misbehavior in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| I mean, if we're going to talk about it, then let's talk about it, but not pretend like it's not going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| and because it makes you uncomfortable that we're not going to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3983)|
| 1:06:26| Like I said, that man violated my personal space by walking up on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| I didn't know if he was here or not, but clearly he saw me, and he felt it was appropriate to approach me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Yet, even though you called someone in here, it took forever to remove him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| He stood next to me for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| How many seconds ticked off that clock before he finally was removed away from me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| How much of my time was wasted because he stood here next to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| That's why I said that at this point my biggest concern is to vote and remove every last one of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| There is a culture here of corruption that is clearly occurring in this system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| and you are definitely held responsible for it as if you have the knowledge of these things taking place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| and you don't do the proper things, i.e., blow the whistle, i.e., whistleblowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| You have rights of protection as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| You're supposed to do something about these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4025)|
| 1:07:07| not sit here and try to silence me when I have concerns of the matter because it makes you uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| and now suddenly you don't want to have it addressed here today because you're talking about giving advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| My advice is to do something, or the advice I'm going to give the public is to vote to remove, plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| That's my advice for the whole matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| This is a poor demonstration of, once again, as I said, of this local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| I'll be here tomorrow to talk to the city about the same thing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Trust me, I'm calling for every last one of you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| It's time for changes in this government because you have shown excessively and repeatedly how you don't care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4053)|
| 1:07:38| how you have no concern or consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| how you do not consider our feelings as people of taxpayers in our lower-income communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| and yet you sit here and tell me to my face that I don't have the right to speak on these matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| Insanity is what I call that, and a waste of my time, and that means you do not belong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| And that's why I'm going to push for the public to find our own candidates that we support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| that we validate and think are trustworthy to do the right job to take your place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| We're going to try with somebody else different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| And once we go local, if that means we take it state and federal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| all we have to do is chain of command until we get the appropriate changes that we are seeking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| You all have failed on your part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| That's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| If you was doing a great job, I wouldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| I'm here because you have failed to do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| That's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| So my advice is to do something, or you can be replaced in the next election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| Plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Take care of yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| Next on our public forum, that's Constance Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4112)|
| 1:08:42| We have Jennifer Resch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Jennifer, are you here from the Board of Realtors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| Roche, sorry, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4130)|
| 1:09:01| Hi, Jennifer Roche, 609 White Scarpa Road, Association of Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| I'm speaking on a later agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| It's Resolution R-19-4903,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| and this is the potential amendment to the process of making zoning text amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4151)|
| 1:09:19| or amendments to the zoning text with MPC and Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| We just request that the current process stay the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4166)|
| 1:09:31| This amendment would make all text amendments to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| sorry, this resolution would make all text amendments to the zoning code go before commission first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| before MPC would be able to move along with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| I guess that's my understanding of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| And we feel like that would put kind of a chilling effect to the public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| and the checks and balances that we have between MPC and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| MPC are really a lot of the experts on the zoning code and the zoning processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| and we really want MPC and the public before MPC to be able to state their whole case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| to give their whole testimony and to air a lot of the issues with whatever text amendments they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4202)|
| 1:10:08| So it just seems odd that commission would vote at the beginning of the amendment process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4208)|
| 1:10:17| and then send it back to MPC and then also at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| So we don't want to stop the process before it starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| and I apologize if this sounds a little confusing because it was a little confusing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| So if Commissioner Schoonmaker has any comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| if I'm getting the process wrong in what your resolution is suggesting, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| But we're just making a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| I'm here with some realtors and builders that we keep the process how it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| and that this resolution does not move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| I don't know what problems it's trying to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| We're concerned about problems it may cause in the process of amending the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4246)|
| 1:10:52| and really slowing down an already long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| I think we have a good public comment period with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| And then, of course, the zoning text amendments always end at commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| and you still have a say, and I think those checks and balances are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| And I know that will come up for a discussion later in the agenda as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| but thank you for coming on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| Next, moving on to smile things, I'm looking over at Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| We've got some great young men here tonight that we are here to recognize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| So, Madam Clerk, would you go ahead and call out the next item on our agenda, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| This is Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| It's honoring the Bearden High School Boys Basketball Team for winning the state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4296)|
| 1:11:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Do we have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| First, I would like to ask the young men to come down to the podium, come down with your coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| Mayor Jacobs, would you join us down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| And I don't think some people know this little tidbit of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| but Super Bob was actually a coach at Bearden whenever I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| So would you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Bringing those two down will not add to my average height for this lineup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| But if you would, I recommend approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Who is the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| So we have a proper motion from Commissioner Smith and a second from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4340)|
| 1:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Well, we'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| I think we'll go ahead and get it, but we want to have a vote right now on this one and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| Go ahead and vote, and would the clerk please read the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| All in favor of this resolution, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4357)|

| 1:12:41| So all in favor please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=4362)|

| 1:23:53| next item is number 43 ordinance O-19-3-102. It's amending Knox County Code chapter six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5033)|
| 1:24:02| article two entitled animal control to authorize a trap neuter return program for community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5042)|

| 1:24:20| January 28th, 2008 and ordinance O-15-4-101 adopted May 26th, 2015. This is on second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5060)|
| 1:24:29| reading. Motion to approve. Okay there's a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| Is there a second? Second by Commissioner Jay. Moving into discussion on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5074)|
| 1:24:41| as I said it will treat this similar to public forum and I know Tanner Jessel had approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5081)|
| 1:24:48| earlier and would like to speak to this subject and you've got five minutes sir and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| could go ahead and approach the podium and state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| please. Sure. My name is Tanner Jessel. I live at 1026 Olive Street in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5094)|
| 1:25:02| Thank you for the chance to speak against trap neuter release. I want to first refute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| three items shared at the first reading of this ordinance. First, Lauren Bluestone from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| Nashville Animal Care and Control alleged for every 1,000 studies that do not support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5111)|
| 1:25:17| TNR there are another 1,000 that do. I can say as both a trained librarian and a trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| biologist that the vast majority of scientific studies authored by subject matter experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| contend trap neuter return alone does not work. One study from Tufts University even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5129)|
| 1:25:34| says that TNR is a worse solution than doing nothing as it emboldens irresponsible pet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| owners to dump unwanted reproductively intact cats at managed cat colonies. Second, Bluestone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5140)|
| 1:25:46| also alleged cats are fully vaccinated when they're released. It is true the cats are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| inoculated but the animals need 28 days to develop rabies virus antibodies. At a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| cats should be held for 28 days to minimize the serious risks posed by rabies. Also add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5157)|
| 1:26:03| that while the animals may eventually develop antibodies to rabies, they remain host to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| a wide range of pathogens and parasites from flesh eating bacteria that we heard about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| to protozoans, worms, fungal pathogens and the infamous Toxoplasma gondii which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| protozoan that reproduces exclusively in the gut of cats and it can infect the human food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5178)|

| 1:26:30| otters and cat waste is such a serious health risk to humans that the U.S. Centers for Disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5190)|
| 1:26:35| Control and Prevention advises that pregnant women avoid cleaning cat litter boxes while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| pregnant. Third, Janet Testerman asserted that no one else is bringing alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| and that's just not true. I and others in the community have been advocating for trap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| neuter contain as in a cat sanctuary. Think Club Med for cats, ferals included. The alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5209)|
| 1:26:57| is being implemented in Hillsborough County, Florida, Richmond, British Columbia and Lenai,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Hawaii. The sanctuary alternative resolves public health concerns about rabies and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| pathogens that I mentioned that make free roaming cats a public health risk. It also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| ensures the animals have adequate shelter during bitterly cold months. We have the polar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| vortex. It prevents cats from harming wildlife and it prevents the cats from being harmed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| by other wildlife like coyotes, owls or hawks. It also prevents the cats from being hit by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| cars. Between the last reading and this reading, I saw a cat in my neighborhood that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| community cat dead on the road. The apparent reason Young-Williams is not pursuing a sanctuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5248)|
| 1:27:34| model is because it costs more. I have to ask, are the public health costs, the rabies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| risk, the risk of serious harm to wildlife and the cats themselves not the entire reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| the county gives Young-Williams Animal Shelter public tax dollars to start with? For a detailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| look at the sanctuary model including cost breakdowns, Hillsborough County, Florida| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| has a feral stray cat management plan. One approach is two to five acres on land donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| by the county holding up to 750 cats safely and securely. A second approach is a network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| of backyard shelters, ten cats each in a fully fenced yard. Three hundred volunteers could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| host three thousand cats in this model. At first reading, I shared a team of scientists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| led by the top rabies scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| in Atlanta said TNVR has not been shown to reliably reduce feral cat colony populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| for the following reasons. Low implementation rates, inconsistent maintenance, immigration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| of unsterilized cats into colonies and that's a big one. I understand you believe that Young-Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| can clear these hurdles. I want fewer cats and I will be cheering Young-Williams on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| hoping for success but I feel there should be accountability built in up front. If we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5323)|
| 1:28:48| move forward without accountability and common sense ground rules up front such as prohibiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| cat colonies at important bird areas like Seven Islands Wildlife Refuge or the House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| Mountain State Park, there's no compelling reason to establish accountability or common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| sense ground rules later if we move forward now. I was encouraged to hear Janet is opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5343)|
| 1:29:08| to reevaluating in the future but I don't see a mechanism in place now to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| reevaluation takes place. I must appeal to you. Please allow a pause to explore the available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5352)|
| 1:29:18| options, craft measurable outcomes and put common sense restrictions in place up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5358)|
| 1:29:25| The sanctuary solution is a viable path. If we take the time to consider the many alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| better for people, better for wildlife and ultimately better for the cats themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| we will be in a better position in five years to reevaluate success. Thank you for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5380)|

| 1:30:28| cats and decreasing the impact on the ecosystem as well as the wildlife population. I go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| to say that we are all about less cats in this community. We are not reinventing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| wheel as more than 650 jurisdictions across this country have implemented this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5440)|
| 1:30:47| It has been effective and just in the two months, two and a half months that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| doing it based on city council. It has greatly reduced the population of cats within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| shelter. It has greatly reduced the risk of disease of such things as urinary tract infection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5460)|
| 1:31:09| and we've released them really to the positive response of this community. I go back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| endorsements of the American Bar Association, of both American Public Health Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5475)|
| 1:31:22| the Community for Disease Control does support this initiative as well as the International| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5482)|

| 1:31:32| Managers issued a thorough guidebook to assist municipal leaders stating non-targeted selective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| response to a population which is reproducing at high rates doesn't help to reduce cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| populations and nuisances in our communities, improve cat welfare, further public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| and safety or mitigate the real impact of cats on wildlife. Instead, sterilization and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| vaccination programs such as Trap, Neuter, Return are being implemented to manage cat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| population in communities across the country. Well-managed TNR programs, which is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| have in place, offer a humane and proven way to resolve conflicts, reduce population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| and prevent disease outbreaks by including vaccinations against rabies and other potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| diseases. So I go back as constituents expect solutions, however imperfect, and more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5540)|
| 1:32:28| 80% do not agree with euthanasia as a means to population control. We've been Trap, Neutering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| and Containment for more than 100 years and it hasn't proven to be effective. It results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| in high euthanasia rates and that is certainly not an answer to overpopulation or this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| TNVR represents a vast improvement over the traditional approach of impoundment and lethal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| injection, although the latter approach has been used, as I just said, for more than 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| years. There's simply no evidence that it's produced a long-term population reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| and truly is the poster child for failed public policy. So we're asking to get off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| the hamster wheel. We do not want to cater to the exception but to the rule and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5590)|
| 1:33:16| ask that you vote to pass this ordinance tonight and I would like to toss it to my Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| of Operations who came to us two years ago from Humane Society of Silicon Valley who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| implemented this program more than 10 years ago, if I might do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5607)|
| 1:33:37| Thank you Commissioners. Do you need my name and everything? Yes, please. Nicole Boudreau,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| 3201 Division Street. Would you like me to keep it to, oh, I've got five minutes. Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| in fairness, let's keep it, I think Ms. Teshman was at about two minutes or approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5628)|
| 1:33:54| so that would probably be in fairness to both sides on this. Okay, I'll keep it brief. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| as Janet was saying, I come from Humane Society Silicon Valley where I was for 10 years. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| been at Young-Williams for two years and this is my passion, this is my career. When I first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| entered the field in 2009, things had not changed in decades. Right here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5650)|
| 1:34:18| this was the reality up until two years ago as well. Some of my current staff have stood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| in the euthanasia room on Division Street for entire eight hour shifts, putting over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| 100 animals down per day because that's just the way we've always done it. That's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| what we do. Well, that excuse just doesn't work anymore because there's an entire industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| of experts who have done the research and found the answers to prevent this unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| loss of life. Among those answers are a handful of programs that create the framework of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| no-kill community, but the foundation is always the same, a robust community CAP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| It's been said over and over, but it bears repeating. Community CAP programs have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| proven to decrease feline populations. Communities all over the country are currently practicing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| TNVR, including Nashville, Memphis, and Chattanooga. The community in California where I came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5700)|
| 1:35:10| was one of the first to implement this program and today there is far more demand than supply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| of cats. The shelter I came from is now driving 200 or more miles away just to rescue cats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| just to fill their adoption kennels. Doesn't that sound like a great problem to have? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| alternatives to this program are few and none have been brought forward to us thus far that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| have been viable. We've taken about 5,000 cats per year, so building a sanctuary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| that size over just a couple of years, it would be incredibly overcrowded, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| the state we're at right now at the shelter with the overcrowding. So anyways, the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| part of our community CAP program here in Knoxville is that we have a wealth of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5745)|
| 1:35:49| supporting a multi-pronged approach to address this issue. We have a coordinator overseeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| this program full-time, grant dollars to fund surgeries, traps, deterrents, educational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| materials. We have mentors at a national level who will implement, who help implement these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| programs all over the country. Okay, ma'am, I think y'all have hit about your five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| that I gave both sides at the beginning. What I'd like to do is ask my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| if they have any questions about this and I will see if there are any folks chime in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| with lights. Okay, yes, Commissioner Gill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to ask a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5777)|
| 1:36:25| question about the cost savings and where would that money be invested from this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5785)|
| 1:36:37| So to answer that question, the cost savings, right now cats are in our shelter and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5797)|
| 1:36:44| TNVR program is about bringing them in, spay neutering them, vaccinating them and returning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| them opposed to cats lingering within our system. So when they're in a shelter environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| they're subject to very high stress which leads to the upper respiratory infection that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| I mentioned earlier which we then have to treat before they're even remotely eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| for adoption. So in that case, we're able to return these animals where they have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| 70 to 100% chance of returning to their environment and or home. And so therefore, those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5832)|
| 1:37:20| can then be reallocated within the shelter to treat behavior problems with dogs, to treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5840)|
| 1:37:27| more medical issues that we see on a daily basis. So whether we have orthopedic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5847)|
| 1:37:35| or we get the hit by cars, we get all of that. So it would allow us to free up the resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| that we're now spending on cats that are lingering in a shelter environment because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| it takes longer to get them adopted and move them through that we then be able to reallocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5867)|
| 1:37:52| We also have a pet resource center so we're working to allocate those resources to an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| underserved community. So be it pet food pantry, be it to help allocate resources to help partially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| subsidize pet friendly housing deposits and also to help subsidize acute vet care issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| that might come up. So those are just a handful of ways that we're able to reallocate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Any other questions? Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Janet, do you all have any programs or systems in place to measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| the efficiency of this program, say, in two years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| So part of our program, we have a dedicated community cat coordinator, Christy Jarvis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| who's with us tonight. And so really, this is a comprehensive program. It's not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| we're just bringing them in to spay, neuter, vaccinate and return to their environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5923)|
| 1:38:50| It is multi-pronged. And so part of that is through our software system is to track whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5930)|
| 1:38:57| a cat comes in through animal control or whether a cat comes in through a Good Samaritan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| picks one up or whether it's an owner surrender. So what we do is then able to capture that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5942)|
| 1:39:09| information and we're able to look at it, be it by zip code or demographic or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5949)|
| 1:39:14| to look for hotspots throughout the community. And then we're able to work with people on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| the ground in those communities through education outreach and that type of thing to then, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| address those hotbeds and the overpopulation within those high intake areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Okay. Will there be a way to distinguish between Fluffy got out the door and a feral cat in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| a colony or will Fluffy get spayed, neutered, vaccinated and sent to the colony?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| Well, it's not necessarily so. To explain that a little bit is when these cats come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5983)|
| 1:39:50| in the door, they get a full wellness exam. So for instance, let's say Fluffy's declawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5990)|
| 1:39:57| A declawed cat, a medically unhealthy cat or kittens are not eligible for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=5997)|
| 1:40:06| And so therefore, if they don't, no one comes in to reclaim, then those animals then move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6006)|
| 1:40:12| to the adoption floor. So they are evaluated to then determine whether they're eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| for community cat program. To that point, let's say Fluffy does come in, we do spay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6016)|
| 1:40:23| neuter, we do vaccinate, we take that cat right back to where it was picked up. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| that goes back to if it is an indoor, outdoor cat of somebody, I mean, would we like for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| all cats to be inside? Absolutely. But that's not the reality. So that cat would then go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6034)|
| 1:40:40| back to where it was picked up to where it does have a 70 to 100% chance of finding its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| way back home because that's its known environment. So there are people out there caring for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6044)|
| 1:40:50| lot of these animals, be it a colony where there might be a colony caretaker, a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| Samaritan, but there might be multiple neighbors feeding a cat that just roams from your house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| for breakfast and somebody else's house for dinner. Multiple people caring for these cats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| So overall, there are people in the community that are caring for these cats in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6066)|
| 1:41:11| shape or form. Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| I was just wondering if you'll keep the education process of telling people, I hope people don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| get complacent, their cat goes missing, they don't bother to check at Young-Williams, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| think it will just come back eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| No, I mean, absolutely. Education is a big part of this because we've got to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| community's help in order for this program to work. And right now, there are a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| caretakers that have been underground, so to speak, because they don't want to be cited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| for trespassing. They don't want to be cited. And so we want to be able to bring these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6098)|
| 1:41:44| work with them in tandem to help educate them in order to properly either care for, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6104)|
| 1:41:54| really spay and neuter is our mission to address the overpopulation in these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6114)|
| 1:42:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| Okay, is there any other discussion items, discussion related to this? Okay, this motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| is properly before us. All in favor? We do need a roll call vote on this one. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| So, Madam Clerk, who do we start with tonight? So, Commissioner Smith, the rotation starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| with you. So, go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6139)|

| 1:43:14| I did, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| I was trying to get to your heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6198)|
| 1:43:23| The next item is number 46. It's a discussion item with Parks and Recreation Senior Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| Paul White regarding the youth baseball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| Okay, this is a discussion item, and I know that Commissioner Bussler has been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6213)|
| 1:43:37| really hard on this, and it's probably taken us a few months to actually get this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| us. So I'm going to go ahead and call on Commissioner Bussler. If you could tee this up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6221)|
| 1:43:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've given out some handouts. One of them looks sort of like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| This is the current contract that we're using now in Knox County. You'll see some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| items there. You'll see pages like this that has reports that are supposed to be given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| through the Knox County Public Parks, and you'll see there's just very few of them that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6246)|
| 1:44:13| are filled out properly, but if you go to the one that says Halls Community Park, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| stapled together by itself. You'll see a report that's filled out in depth, and you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| some of the monies that are raised at some of these facilities. Now, I'm not in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| to make a lot of money off these facilities, but we're using tax dollars to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| these facilities, which should be self-paying for the whole parks and recs off of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| parks. But one thing that's really telling, so I've got in my hand here this year's USA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6282)|
| 1:44:52| tournament. This is a national organization. It says, Back to Knoxville, Knoxville Tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6292)|
| 1:45:02| These are 16 tournaments. We've already had seven tournaments here, supposedly, in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6302)|
| 1:45:11| only one was here in Knoxville. The rest of them, even though they're Knoxville tournaments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| have been played in Loudoun, Dandridge, Oak Ridge, Anderson County, again in Loudoun County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| and we'll have one more out of these 16 that will be played here saying this is the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| area for them. And my question was, why do we have this national organization that plays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6329)|
| 1:45:36| tournaments to Knoxville? And it's real telling on this, in red letters right here it says, Back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6336)|
| 1:45:43| Knoxville Home. Now, that could bring a lot of tax dollars into this area. I asked Mr. White to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| here and give you a little information about some of these things that are being filled out. You can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6352)|
| 1:45:58| how much money that comes through these parks. We can also get a little bit of that revenue to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| the fills up, to update the fills, and still not go into taxpayers' pockets to get taxpayers' dollars to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6365)|
| 1:46:13| these fills up. People are making big time money off the backs of taxpayers in these parks. Almost five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6373)|
| 1:46:21| ago I came in here and said, you know, we should look at having tournaments here in Knoxville. And I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| told we're not going to spend any extra money on these parks. Well, we don't have to. We didn't have to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6387)|
| 1:46:34| any money before. These reports show we can make revenue off of it and give good parks and still let the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6394)|
| 1:46:42| locals make money for their teams and for their communities. Now, Mr. White here was good enough to listen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6402)|
| 1:46:51| me, and I listened to his people tell me about the things that are going on in the parks. And some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6411)|
| 1:46:58| things can raise money that he's self-sufficient. He can be working and have plenty of money to run the parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6418)|
| 1:47:08| rec without having money from the taxpayers. And I'll let him explain that. And, Paul, I really do appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| coming up here for the second or third time. I don't know how many times I've brought you up here. But now that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6434)|
| 1:47:20| got this time, you can come up here and tell us what you would like to do to take these over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| Mr. White, Senior Director of Knox County Parks and Rec. I brought Chuck James, Director of Parks. We're at 2447| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6446)|
| 1:47:33| Sutherland. Troy Fleming is our Recreation Manager. When I came in in September, Mayor Jacobs and Chief Hayer sat me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| down and I met with Chuck, and we looked at a lot of things that we inherited. And this was an issue that we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6461)|
| 1:47:49| from day one. And when I came in, football was right in the midst, and we had some issues. And I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6469)|
| 1:47:56| going to say, we had some issues that we had to tackle immediately with football. We hired Troy. And on the 1st of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6476)|
| 1:48:03| October, we get football squared away. We're working into basketball. And then baseball has come up. And one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| things with baseball is, just to clarify, Knox County Sports Park out on Oak Ridge Highway, we do use that one for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6491)|
| 1:48:18| rentals and have tournaments. We have five fields there. We have one, since I came in, I made specifically varsity, which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6498)|
| 1:48:27| 60-90. We put a permanent pitching mound on it so we can have our varsity middle school and high schools play out there in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6507)|
| 1:48:35| weekend tournaments. Also, one of the things to clarify as well is that there are a lot of community parks that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6515)|
| 1:48:42| organizations, and we're trying to get control of those organizations. And one of the things, their original intent was that each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6522)|
| 1:48:53| community have an organization to play recreational baseball, sometimes softball. But what has happened is, almost every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6533)|
| 1:49:02| weekend, they're having tournaments, and we're not made aware of them. We're asked, you know, we've met with the Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| Department, we've met with David, we've met with Ben Charbel, and we've met with other people to try to see how we can look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6549)|
| 1:49:17| contracts. They're really not contracts, they're more user agreements, but it's just a big undertaking. But I want to assure you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| with the help of the Mayor, we have looked at these closely, and we are in the process of gaining accountability and control. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6564)|
| 1:49:31| one of the things we've done is, coming up at the end of May, Chuck gave up a position on the maintenance side, and we're going to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6571)|
| 1:49:40| in someone to handle baseball, to work at the parks, to make sure that we have a better representation and better control. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6580)|
| 1:49:48| really what we want to see is, we want to see people have a chance to play. We want to see, you know, a parent with their child be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| able to go when there's not games going on and work on their game. That's what the tax dollars are subsidized for, and that we can have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6595)|
| 1:50:06| really significant recreational programs. And Troy's been, I'll let Troy speak for a second, but he's done a really good job of meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6606)|
| 1:50:15| with all these commissioners at these organizations at our parks and trying to gain control and saying, you know, if you have a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| tournament, something along those lines we're supportive of, if you're having something for your rec league, but to have tournaments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6622)|
| 1:50:31| bring you money individually each weekend, and we're paying for the upkeep, we don't really, that's not what our intent was, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6631)|
| 1:50:41| inherited that and we're making some changes. Troy, do you want to speak on that briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6641)|
| 1:50:47| Again, my name is Troy Fleming. As Paul said, we are working diligently to get the commissioners of these youth leagues to understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6647)|
| 1:50:54| you're not going to run a personal business on public property. The biggest thing is to understand, too, is that the objective of youth sports is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6654)|
| 1:51:01| for kids to get an opportunity to play. Rec league is for Monday through Friday, and parents usually work a lot. I'm a parent, I work, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6661)|
| 1:51:08| four kids, so I understand on the weekends when I want an opportunity to go out to a ballpark, I should have that right to go out there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6668)|
| 1:51:14| play in a crowd in a ball field, or wherever it is, and not be asked to move off of the field because they have a tournament coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6674)|
| 1:51:21| So we reach out weekly to the guys, figuring out what tournaments are going on, because at the end of the day, this park belongs to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| taxpayers, and that's my objective here, and our objective at Knox County Parks and Rec is to do the most good for the best people that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| do it for, in any and every community in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6695)|
| 1:51:42| And one of the things, before we get to your question, Commissioner Biggs, is that we filter everything through safety, and everything we do is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| most good for the most people. So we are working diligently to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6709)|
| 1:51:57| So I see we have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| We've got a few lights here, but Commissioner Bussler, your light is still on. Do you have anything to say, or would you like me to move to some of the other commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| Well, we'll move to the other commissioners, but I do want to say one thing. Parks are made for them to use on weekends, but the amount of money, if you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6725)|
| 1:52:14| see, just through the five that are really, or six that are reporting, there's a lot of money that goes through there, and they sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| sponsorships, they sell all these other things, but that money that they raise goes into private pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| We could use some of that money that they make if they would use some of the other things that we may have available to us, still not taking away a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6748)|
| 1:52:39| from those tournaments, but still upgrade other parks to where we have a lot of parks where we can use for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6759)|
| 1:52:46| And I think Paul has a good idea in what he's doing, but he needs support, and we need to make sure that we have these contracts that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6766)|
| 1:52:52| written, not for the benefit for the private individual, but for the public, and he's on that track doing it, and I appreciate all he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6772)|
| 1:53:05| We've sat down, we've talked, and it's, we need those other tournaments to come in here to bring outside tax dollars, but we also need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6785)|
| 1:53:12| fields for the people, the taxpayers that are paying for them also to be used, and good fields, and not some of these fields that we have out there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6792)|
| 1:53:29| that we have to get from private individuals. But thank you for listening to me. Maybe we can help him out some way, and Paul, I'm here to support you all I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6809)|
| 1:53:36| Absolutely, and thank you, and Commissioner Bussler brought up a good point, is that we are working diligently right now to gain control, and to amend these agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6816)|
| 1:53:47| and have, Troy and I are working hard to have a standard, if it's, you know, four tournaments annually for each park, but we want communication, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6827)|
| 1:53:57| everything to come through us, and we're going to set up an annual fee that we collect at the park, and we're going to set up an annual fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6837)|
| 1:54:05| at the beginning of the year, and that way, you know, because what we want to see is, we want to see kids play, but we also want to see the tax dollars go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6845)|
| 1:54:14| back into the fields, and the things that we can improve our fields, so we're working, we're just, please know we're working diligently to amend that and correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6854)|
| 1:54:24| Thank you, Mr. White. I'm going to go ahead and call on Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. White, thank you for everything you're doing. It sounds like you're doing a great job. I appreciate you and your amazing team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6868)|
| 1:54:35| I have a couple questions. Do we know how long our hotel stays are for these tournaments when people come in from out of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6875)|
| 1:54:43| Typically, we get them on Friday night, and they leave Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| So, they have two nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| Okay, my next question is, have you been to Chattanooga or maybe Bay County down in Florida where they have these large complexes, and Commissioner Bussler was talking about how lucrative it is to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6891)|
| 1:54:56| If we could have a major complex where we could draw a large out-of-town crowd that would eat at our restaurants, stay at our hotels, somewhere out in the county, and help generate funds, where would you prefer us to start a study about doing something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| Well, there have been some initial talks. We would love, in our department, within our department, we would love to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6902)|
| 1:55:09| My son plays. He's a freshman at West High. He's playing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| But we, in the summer, he plays every weekend in Cartersville, Georgia, or East Cobb, and I spend thousands of dollars on the hotel and the food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| And so, that's something I would love to see happen here, where the location he plays at in Atlanta has a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6922)|
| 1:55:53| It has multi-purpose basketball courts. It has a big water park, a place to do wakeboarding. It's just a big complex that draws a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6953)|
| 1:56:06| And you see everyone on that exit, it's all built up from that, hotels, restaurants. So, we would love to see that happen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6966)|
| 1:56:14| So, are the complexes close to the freeway system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| Is that what you're saying, kind of a little closer to the freeway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6977)|
| 1:56:19| Okay. I appreciate you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| Okay. Commissioner Biggs, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| Okay. Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| Yeah. Hey, Paul, there's a couple of examples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| You look through these agreements, and Halls Community Park has spent thousands of dollars, and not including their, I mean, we don't own all of that, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=6991)|
| 1:56:40| We don't own all of Halls Park as Knox County, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| It's my understanding that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| We own that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| But they've invested a lot of time, effort, and money outside of, I mean, give me a list of, I guess I'd like to see a list of what parks do we own that are being used by other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7008)|
| 1:57:00| And I look at this CBFO, the softball issue, or the softball contract, and they're all, I think we're talking about them not spending any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7020)|
| 1:57:13| but all of them have given the county the fees that have been requested of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| Chuck James, Knox County Parks, 2447 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| The only park that I think that we don't own is Bower Field, and we lease that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| It's currently probably on, we get a seven-year lease, and I think we're on about year five now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7047)|
| 1:57:33| But every other park I do believe we own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| And also, Commissioner, to what you're saying is there are entities and organizations that are doing a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| Farragut does not have any tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7064)|
| 1:57:46| CBFO does not have any tournaments outside of their league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| Their financials, as a former banker, their financials are impeccable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| They build a lot of the buildings and the bathrooms and things at their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| They have either worked within their own organization or with us, and they're pretty much a model organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| Right, that's kind of, because the things that we were handed out, as we were talking, everybody's riding for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| But, I mean, these organizations, Halls and CBFO, they're really doing the majority of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7091)|
| 1:58:16| The county has invested very little money in parks over the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| I don't know of very little money, but we work in partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| It's about $300,000 in capital a year that we need to spend two or three times that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| But that's not your, I mean, but we, as a county, for what we have as parks, the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7109)|
| 1:58:36| especially Bowerfield, or not Bowerfield, well, Bowerfield is totally, they're built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7116)|
| 1:58:41| but the community that uses the parks have invested just as much as the county has in them, time, materials, sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7121)|
| 1:58:50| I mean, so I agree with you we need to come and have one blanket policy for all the parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7130)|
| 1:58:57| but I didn't want the public to listen to this and think that we have people that are freeloading on our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| We don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| I mean, some of the organizations, like I said, have met our requirements with their financials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| and a lot of them have a really good partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| and that's our goal is that we want to supply them with the chalk and with the sand and the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7153)|
| 1:59:19| But sometimes it is frustrating, as Commissioner Bussler pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| that we get called right before a big tournament to come mow when we've already scheduled to mow a couple days before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| We get called to replace the toilet paper, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| and we're seeing these tournaments posted all over Facebook on some of our community parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7172)|
| 1:59:36| So we just want a better relationship and partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| What stops us from taking control right now of our park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| Well, it's just manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| I have two people in my recreation department, so taking over all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| But we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| We're hiring someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| We're working to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7190)|
| 1:59:51| And then I think, secondly, we wanted to make sure with David Buick and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| and with everyone that we were doing it correctly, and Commissioner Bussler was involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| and we looked at making sure that, you know, what these leases were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7201)|
| 2:00:05| and they were in actuality not leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| They were user agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7207)|
| 2:00:08| So we could, and we are, but we want to make sure that they comply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| as some of the organizations have, and be good partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| And we don't have to worry about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| We work well with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7220)|
| 2:00:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| Commissioner Bussler's opening statement referenced where a tournament was supposed to be played in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7227)|
| 2:00:35| but it was actually in the surrounding jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| At the same time, were those fields reserved in Knox County where other people couldn't have come in for a tournament to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7239)|
| 2:00:47| because they had a user agreement for those fields even though they weren't being used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7247)|
| 2:00:56| What you're talking about, we have one individual that does leases for all fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| and if you have to have a tournament, he's already got the user agreement taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7262)|
| 2:01:08| and some of the larger tournaments that we could have had in here, we didn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| and there's an individual that's using these fields as a leverage to keep other teams out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7275)|
| 2:01:23| to where he controls the fields that are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| And to further that, what he's saying is what the gentleman will do is he'll go to our community parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| When we try to rent the sports park out to someone else, this gentleman he's addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| and some others will go to our community parks and meet with the community directors of the organizations there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7300)|
| 2:01:50| and we'll meet with them and throw a free tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| and they will pull all the teams that we've had trying to come in for the sports park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7313)|
| 2:01:58| They'll go to Halls or Powell-Levi or whatever it may be or Loudon or Oak Ridge, which we don't have jurisdiction of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| but that sometimes becomes difficult because then we can't make a tournament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7324)|
| 2:02:10| because all the teams leave because they can go for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| But in actuality, we're funding the tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| But it's on our fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7336)|
| 2:02:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7337)|
| 2:02:18| We're not getting the concessions because the concessions are going to those local commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7338)|
| 2:02:26| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| Yeah, I guess you can call it subleasing, what they're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7349)|
| 2:02:33| but we've sent multiple e-mails warning them that that's a violation of the user agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| You must get our approval if you're going to let somebody else use your park that you've come to a user agreement with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| if you're not going to use it that weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| And that's the biggest problem because, again, your money is being exchanged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| but you can't track it and you're calling and you're asking them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| did you allow such and such to use the park this weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| You're like, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| How much did you charge them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Oh, you know, I didn't charge them anything, but obviously I wasn't born yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| I know that money has been exchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| So our biggest issue is by putting a hold of that is we constantly send e-mails letting them know that if it continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7382)|
| 2:03:08| then we'll just have to get the law department involved to make sure we do it the legal way of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| not allowing you to use the facility anymore by either, you know, tearing up a user agreement effective immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| or if it continues, go as far as not allowing you to be on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7397)|
| 2:03:22| How many times do you think they've sublet our county parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| I'm sure it happens every weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| So more than how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| Because in baseball, three strikes and you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| So we should be moving forward with eliminating this user agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| I mean, that's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7419)|
| 2:03:40| But I do appreciate, you know, the administration of the parks department being proactive in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7420)|
| 2:03:46| and doing all the investigation work because this is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| This is absolutely dead wrong for the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| But I would move as quickly as you can to deny that user agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7434)|
| 2:03:59| because you guys are paying to mow the fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| They're not doing anything except maybe chalking it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| You guys are doing all the work, and they're getting all the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7447)|
| 2:04:08| And exclusive rights to our county parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| Commissioner, this has been going on for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| but like Mr. White said, when the mayor came on board, we addressed it with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7453)|
| 2:04:19| and we've been looking ever since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| I just want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Since he's been on board, we've been able to go out and put up new fences in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| We put them in east Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| We had some fences that were 45 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7468)|
| 2:04:31| When he came in on the safety issue, he said correct this stuff today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| So that's what I'm most proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| We won the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| We were the sports park of the year in the state of Tennessee off Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7478)|
| 2:04:42| So they came before commission last year at this time and received the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7482)|
| 2:04:46| So we have some great parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| We have some great people here, and we're going to get a handle on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| and, you know, give us six months, and we'll come back and give another report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| Commissioner Skidmaker, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7501)|
| 2:05:02| For some of our newer members of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| I'd like to let them know that we did do an RFP for a sports complex feasibility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7504)|
| 2:05:10| and we have received the first part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| The second part of that should be out pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| The reason why I've chosen to pursue this is for two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| One, to tourism dollars for money into our coppers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| and two, with a sports dedicated complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7525)|
| 2:05:29| it may provide more opportunities for our local kids to have an even greater range of places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| that they can participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| And I might tag onto that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| When Commissioner Smith was chairman of this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| he actually conducted a chairman's briefing specifically focused on this subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| It was very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7547)|
| 2:05:48| I seem to recall we had Kim in Knoxville who spoke to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| It was some really good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| Former Commissioner Bob Thomas was on the Parks and Rec's board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| Is there a commissioner currently on the Parks and Rec board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| Larson Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| I did not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| I'm just confirming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7572)|
| 2:06:13| Thank you, Mr. Jay, for serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| Commissioner's been an integral part in working with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| on some key projects we're working on moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| and we appreciate his involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| And he's always accessible and helped us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| But I just want to end this, unless there are more questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| but in saying again, Mayor Jacobs' administration has given us all the framework to make this happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7595)|
| 2:06:44| and we will get it turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| And we're very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7606)|
| 2:06:47| All of us have been impacted by sports in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7607)|
| 2:06:52| My sons are 12 and 15, and there's not a day goes by that I don't miss the days when they were 4 and 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| or 6 years old running, screaming, I got a hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| So those are important things that we want our kids to be involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| and we want to give them a good product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7624)|
| 2:07:06| And as far as the sports, as far as a big sports facility, we would love to see that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| and we would work diligently to give everyone a world-class product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7633)|
| 2:07:18| So thank you guys very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7638)|
| 2:07:20| And the last thing is there are some really good people involved in our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7640)|
| 2:07:24| and some of the organizations, as Commissioner Anders pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| they're doing a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7648)|
| 2:07:30| We're just trying to get a handle of it as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| All right, thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| Any other follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| Let's see, I see Commissioner Biggs' line on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7657)|
| 2:07:39| Commissioner Busser, would you like to close this after Commissioner Biggs goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7662)|
| 2:07:43| Okay, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| I've got a question for Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7666)|
| 2:07:48| You said there was going to be a second part to the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| Do we know when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7671)|
| 2:07:53| The RFP included two phases of the study, a preliminary phase and a final,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7673)|
| 2:07:57| and it should be out any time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7677)|
| 2:08:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| But we will have our opportunity to address both these issues through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| All right, Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| I just want to share a couple of things to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7690)|
| 2:08:13| That's why it's been working with us on this TriStar event that we're going to have out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7693)|
| 2:08:18| which involves youth at the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| And that will bring people in here with their families and things of that sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7702)|
| 2:08:26| to come in here to see their kids play in this kind of a tournament like we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7706)|
| 2:08:30| And there will be pros come in, and they will play one day for some purse money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| and that makes the pros want to bring those people in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| We're looking to have quite a few teams this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| We had it last year was our initial one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| And also he's working with us to use the golf course to do an LPGA event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7724)|
| 2:08:50| which will be coming up in July also with the TriStar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7730)|
| 2:08:54| So those are going to be bringing money into the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| And Mr. Wyatt was still working with us to try to make that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| We want foreign money to come in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| We don't want local money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| We want some of that foreign money in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| And he has obliged me or has listened to me, some of my crazy ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7746)|
| 2:09:12| and he kind of goes, okay, and then walks away and says, we're probably not going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| but, hey, we'll just make him happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| Thank you, Mr. Wyatt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7759)|
| 2:09:20| Thank you for bringing your staff with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7763)|
| 2:09:24| All right, Commissioner Bussler, thank you for kind of pushing this discussion forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| And, Mr. Wyatt, I seem to recall when it comes to recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7767)|
| 2:09:30| our sons have been on the same Upward Soccer team not too many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7770)|
| 2:09:34| so it's fun to see this coming back this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7774)|
| 2:09:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7778)|
| 2:09:39| Commissioner Nystrom put Star Wars stickers on the insert of all of their feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| and taught them how to kick a soccer ball, and my son has always appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7783)|
| 2:09:50| So thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| Kicked a ball with Yoda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| So I think that was the advice I provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7795)|
| 2:10:03| Okay, is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| All right, moved by Commissioner Buehler, seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Okay, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7813)|
| 2:10:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| Under Drives and Roads, Item No. 2, consideration of the acceptance of new county roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Okay, there's a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| All in favor, please say excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| Sorry, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7841)|
| 2:10:43| Do you notice how many roads are on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| Do you know how many miles that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| How many miles is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| I see you shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| Yes, I know how many miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| All I know is the letter V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7856)|
| 2:10:58| Those roads down in the future, again, like I've repeated, that has a dollar amount to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| When are we going to start addressing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| I mean, we're going to have to repay them down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7867)|
| 2:11:09| And some of those subdivisions do not have the caps, the last coat on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7869)|
| 2:11:20| No, they have a bond that they put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| And when they get to the last, if they decide that they don't want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| they say you can have the bond and they move away from it and we have to put the last coat of asphalt on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7889)|
| 2:11:36| The thing of it is, and that bond does not really cover that last coat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| but the thing of it is we're putting debt on the county by accepting these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| but not making future investments to where we can repay those and keep our roads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7905)|
| 2:11:54| Now, I don't know how we do it, but there ought to be some sort of dollar figure we put to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| that we put back in the budget for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| That's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7923)|
| 2:12:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| Go ahead and approach us, Jim, if you want to speak to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7933)|
| 2:12:15| I just wanted to clarify for Commissioner Bussler, we do update our bonds annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7935)|
| 2:12:20| so we always ensure that the surety allows for the completion of the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7940)|
| 2:12:25| without payment or cost to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| So I did want to make sure that you all knew that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7949)|
| 2:12:31| that we were diligent about making sure the bond does cover the oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| Thank you, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| I had maybe a statement or a question for Mr. Snowden there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7960)|
| 2:12:49| There are, and I have talked with some different ones in your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| but there are some subdivisions out in District 2 that never got their final coat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| And I've got one lady that's been real upset for quite some time over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| So what is the procedure to these subdivisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7989)|
| 2:13:14| And the county was supposed to come out and address them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7994)|
| 2:13:17| but I have not heard anything back about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=7997)|
| 2:13:21| Commissioner, were you referring to, is it Clearbrook subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8001)|
| 2:13:25| Well, that's a main road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| but I'm talking about a couple other subdivisions out there that haven't had their final coat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8007)|
| 2:13:34| when you've got the driveways and all pulling apart from the road itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8014)|
| 2:13:41| The one that we spoke about was, I think the street is Clearbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| I can't remember the subdivision name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Clearbrook is definitely the one that is in bad, bad need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8027)|
| 2:13:50| and have a really upset, as well as she should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8030)|
| 2:13:55| It's in bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8035)|
| 2:13:57| But then I spoke with some others in the office about these other subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| so I've been waiting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| And I'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| I wasn't aware of any others, but on Clearbrook, I personally drove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| It is in poor condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| Now, I will say it does have the surface coat on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8051)|
| 2:14:15| Oftentimes, if the asphalt that was originally placed don't have the optimal cement ratio in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8055)|
| 2:14:23| the aggregate will become loose and ravel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| and that gives people the appearance or the idea that it doesn't have the surface coat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8066)|
| 2:14:31| So sometimes I think it's a little bit of misinformation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8071)|
| 2:14:35| But in that particular subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| we actually rated it low enough that it will be paved this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| Okay, because I've been waiting to hear from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| and I never did get an official word on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| No, we knew that had the coat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| I mean, that it had its final,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| but it was just the road was in such bad shape for so much traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8090)|
| 2:14:55| which addresses the whole Tazewell Park issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| because if anything happens in between there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| traffic is being routed down Clearbrook through some roads and out to Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8102)|
| 2:15:09| So it's had a lot more traffic on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8109)|
| 2:15:11| So I'm glad to know I can officially tell her it's going to be paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| Ms. Jones, I think, is the lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8116)|
| 2:15:18| I know Ms. Jones well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8118)|
| 2:15:19| Yes, I knew you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| You can let Ms. Jones know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| We've got this on public knowledge here that we trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| We will be paving the entirety of that subdivision later this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8125)|
| 2:15:31| All right, Mr. Snowden, I believe Commissioner Biggs has a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8131)|
| 2:15:34| Director Snowden, I've got a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8134)|
| 2:15:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| The paving in Falcon Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| is that due to the properties that were sold in the tax sale from the trustee's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8140)|
| 2:15:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8146)|
| 2:15:47| Falcon Point is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| It's an older development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| It's been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8151)|
| 2:15:53| We actually, in this particular case, like we were talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| we actually foreclosed the funds and repaved those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| So they're actually, if I'm not mistaken, there's several phases within Falcon Point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| but most of those streets in there should have relatively new surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| where we actually perform the work ourselves at default of the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8172)|
| 2:16:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8173)|
| 2:16:22| Any other follow-up on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8182)|

| 2:21:48| I'm going to go ahead and use a point of personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| I know Mayor Jacobs had something before the meeting gets long in a tooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| Mayor Jacobs, I know you wanted to provide a quick update on the Ellen DeGeneres Show grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| and I'll go ahead and call on you to provide that brief update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| Last week, as my office was contacted, I think, by Gibbs Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8524)|
| 2:22:12| concerning that prize winning, and Shutterfly, which was actually the vendor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8532)|
| 2:22:18| that was giving the money, needed a signed application by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8538)|
| 2:22:25| So I contacted Chairman Nystrom to get his approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| It was approved by the law office, and we went ahead and sent that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| It was $20,000 that we didn't want the schools to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| So just a point of clarification on that's already been applied for with the Ellen Show and Shutterfly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8558)|
| 2:22:48| Thank you. That was part of our consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8568)|
| 2:22:50| Thank you for the update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| Okay, Madam Clerk, and by the way, my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8576)|
| 2:23:00| I'm quite aware of where we are on our agenda, and we've got a lot more things to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| We also have zoning coming up at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| I know we're not going to work through our whole agenda in the next 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8588)|
| 2:23:12| so probably I'll check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| What is the next item on the agenda, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| So we have our general consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| So what I'm going to propose is I'll have the clerk's office review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8599)|
| 2:23:23| and we'll vote on the general consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| and then we will take a recess and hopefully a five-minute break or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| before we open the meeting for zonings, and then we'll come back if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8617)|

| 2:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8633)|
| 2:23:54| So can we do that one before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| Well, I'll grant that if it pleases this body, if we'd like to hear that one right now before we take the break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8636)|
| 2:24:01| Madam Clerk, can we go ahead and call that item, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8641)|
| 2:24:04| Thank you, Commissioner Daley, for bringing that to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8644)|
| 2:24:07| That's Resolution 411.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8647)|
| 2:24:08| It's authorizing submission of an application for a Glitter and Trash Collecting Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8648)|

| 2:24:17| and if said application is approved, authorizing Knox County to enter into a grant contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| for the acceptance of the grant award in an amount up to $168,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8662)|
| 2:24:29| Okay. Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8669)|

| 2:24:44| Hi. My name is Alana McKissack, address 2743 Wimpole Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8684)|
| 2:24:49| I'm here just to speak about what Keep Knoxville Beautiful does with the funds from the litter grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8689)|
| 2:24:53| We are a nonprofit that focuses on litter prevention education, so we contract with Knox County Solid Waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8693)|
| 2:25:00| and two of our main focuses are public education and student education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| We work with the public, neighborhood associations, and different organizations to promote our anti-litter message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8705)|
| 2:25:11| work with them to organize cleanups, and provide free supplies to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| We are also promoting litter-free and waste-free events in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| We actively encourage our residents to reduce their waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| to therefore reduce the amount of litter that is on our streets and our roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8724)|
| 2:25:30| In our last fiscal year, with about 2,400 volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| we removed 60,000 pounds of litter from Knox County roadways, waterways, and parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| The second part of our focus is educating our youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8741)|
| 2:25:45| The kids are our future, so they need to be aware of what is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| We organize cleanups with students at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| We're also going to the schools and provide free education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8753)|
| 2:25:56| We focus on litter prevention and recycling with the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8756)|
| 2:26:00| We actively maintain relationships with UT, LMU, and Pellissippi State students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| often going there to do programs with different professors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8765)|
| 2:26:09| as well as providing service opportunities for the students here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8769)|
| 2:26:16| If you have any questions for me, I'm happy to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8776)|
| 2:26:20| Thank you. Commissioner Daley, any trash talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=8780)|

| 2:32:09| My fellow commissioners, we have got about six minutes until we are scheduled to start the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9129)|
| 2:32:15| I want to take a little bit of direction from all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9135)|
| 2:32:19| We have a relatively light zoning agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9139)|
| 2:32:21| I'm showing four items that came to us, all came to us on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| We could take a break right now or we could jump right into zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9145)|
| 2:32:33| I've got to wait until Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9153)|

| 2:32:41| It will probably be about 7.04 by the time we actually get on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9161)|

| 2:32:53| I'm going to give it about ten minutes, so it will be 7.04 when the zoning meeting starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9173)|

| 2:36:45| The zoning would be consistent with the sector plan designation for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9405)|
| 2:36:50| and would allow development compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9410)|
| 2:36:53| The conditions are that no more than two access drives be permitted to Kate Road regardless of the number of lots created for the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9413)|
| 2:37:01| and two that no access drive be permitted to West Emory Road regardless of the number of lots created from the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9421)|

| 2:37:19| I'd like to ask Mr. Green, that second condition right there was supposed to have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9439)|
| 2:37:23| We had an existing driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Two access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9445)|

| 2:37:35| There's an existing driveway on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9455)|
| 2:37:37| It should read, and I'm sorry, it should read no more than one on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9457)|

| 2:37:55| Is there any opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9475)|

| 2:37:59| I just have a question again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9479)|
| 2:38:01| Okay, so in the MPC documents it says no access drive will be permitted to West Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9481)|
| 2:38:09| and just because they had a single family home there now that they're going to tear down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| to build multiple homes in there, they still get to maintain a driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| That was the request and that was the recommendation of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9499)|
| 2:38:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9504)|
| 2:38:26| We're not actually tearing down anything anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9506)|

| 2:38:32| and it's got a driveway to West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9512)|
| 2:38:35| We just wanted to make sure that we had it in wording that that could stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9515)|
| 2:38:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9520)|

| 2:38:46| I'm still a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9526)|
| 2:38:47| I'm looking at the minutes from the meeting and it says no new access drive will be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9527)|
| 2:38:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9537)|
| 2:38:58| It's an existing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| Okay, so the existing is grandfathered in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9542)|
| 2:39:03| Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9543)|
| 2:39:05| If you're going to do this like you normally do and you say per MPC recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| and as Mr. Green has pointed out, number two on staff recommendation says no access drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9550)|
| 2:39:16| and I think to prevent any problems in the future that it ought to be modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9556)|
| 2:39:21| subject to what Mr. Green said that no additional or however you wanted to do it, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9561)|
| 2:39:29| You have to read the small print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| That was staff recommendation and the staff recommendation was changed at the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| to no new access drive and so you have to read back into the minutes as Commissioner Skinneker pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9575)|
| 2:39:41| So long as it's before this board that it's understood that there will be no new access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9581)|
| 2:39:47| Make a motion to approve per MPC recommendation with a side note of no new access on West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190422?start=9587)|
