| 2:02:25| Lilith Sweeney, if you wanna come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7345)|
| 2:02:29| you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7349)|
| 2:02:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7357)|
| 2:02:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| So mentioned earlier about kind of the hopelessness stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| Some of the bigger issues of like things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| that we wanna be talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| including the ceasefire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| I don't know y'all, it just sucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7382)|
| 2:03:09| They're doing a whole dance right now about the ceasefire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| where they called one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| And within just a few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7395)|
| 2:03:16| there were already bombs falling again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| Spoiler, they're not from Hamas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7399)|
| 2:03:23| It's every time a ceasefire comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| they veto it at the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| Sorry y'all, I'm not good at public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7410)|
| 2:03:32| This is not normally where you see me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| but they just don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| This is a losing issue for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| Protests have disrupted football games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| city markets, council meetings and streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| all over the country, all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| Coastal city docks are being disrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| Military shipments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| I saw a crazy video of people just like charging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| a fence line earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| Wild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7442)|
| 2:04:04| And there's of course the Yemeni Islamic Revolutionary Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7444)|
| 2:04:07| fielded an entire Navy to peacefully cease ships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| supporting the state of Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7450)|
| 2:04:14| So these protests are not just contained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| to like liberal blue city centers and blue American states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7455)|
| 2:04:18| This is a global demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7458)|
| 2:04:21| And every day that this continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| that weapons continue to flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| money and supplies continue to flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| our elected leaders continue to flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| Every day that these bodies keep falling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| anger is gonna grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| Recently, Chattanooga, Johnson City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| and a bunch of other cities around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| also joined the growing wave of protests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| And across the South, we continue to organize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| and try to work to find solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| like the ceasefire resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| that seems to never go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| Outside of Knoxville, as y'all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7496)|
| 2:04:58| there's a chicken processing plant in Morristown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| Became locally famous a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| when the workers started organizing, the migrant workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| and they were disappeared by immigration services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7508)|
| 2:05:14| Kept there in low pay, bad conditions, no healthcare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7514)|
| 2:05:19| obviously no option for organizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| And no workman's comp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| It's something that's very similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| to what we see in Gaza as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| at least pre-October 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7530)|
| 2:05:32| in that a lot of these people were farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7532)|
| 2:05:34| employed by Israelis under those same conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| low pay, no workman's comp, no health insurance, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| And of course, are able to be disappeared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| I forget how many thousands and thousands of prisoners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7546)|
| 2:05:48| held with no trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| When I look to East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| where our black population has been pushed over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7553)|
| 2:05:56| out of their older historic neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| I see no hospitals, no grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| I see red lining, alive and well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| I see streets with no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7564)|
| 2:06:06| I see cracks, and a few years ago, we saw a dead kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7566)|
| 2:06:14| We saw Lisa Edwards ripped out of her chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7574)|
| 2:06:16| We saw, I've already lost three friends this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| to various preventable diseases as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| So I'm actually kind of shaking up here thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| It just feels like I'm surrounded by death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| And I need people to wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7591)|
| 2:06:35| This is not gonna go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| The political situation around is not gonna get better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Because even if it does in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| what is continuing to happen is that more and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7603)|
| 2:06:47| and more countries are turning against Israel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| and therefore turning against the US| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7610)|
| 2:06:52| as Israel tries to just protect it over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| What is happening is that this isn't gonna win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| It's not, it cannot go forever, even beyond just a ceasefire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| These kinds of activities, we're surrounded by death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7623)|
| 2:07:09| And I need people to think and wake up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| Look, we have to be internationalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| And again, and again, and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Because back during World War II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| we brought Nazis back for program paperclip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| We brought them back and put them in NASA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| We supported Pinochet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| We supported terrorist networks for 30 years in Europe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| that caused 30 years of civil war, no surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| Our money going overseas always cycles back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7654)|
| 2:07:38| I mean, what do we think is gonna happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7658)|
| 2:07:46| We just have to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| We have to, good timing, so thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7674)|
| 2:07:59| The next person signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| at public forum is Patricia Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7681)|
| 2:08:05| Patricia Barrier, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7685)|
| 2:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7689)|
| 2:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7699)|
| 2:08:21| Hi, name is Patricia Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7701)|
| 2:08:27| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| The reason why I'm here this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| is so that I can make sure that something is put on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| Could you just put your microphone down a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7717)|
| 2:08:39| just so we can hear you better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| I just wanna make sure that something is put on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| Number one, it would be really awesome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| to have had our one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7726)|
| 2:08:50| and our zoning really look at SW1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| because SW1 was supposed to been low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| and we have high-density and low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7742)|
| 2:09:06| My reason for being here though this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| and Tommy Smith is aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| I knew he wasn't gonna be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| this is pertaining to a two-inch gas line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| that was put from Southbanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| up to Phillips Avenue within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7766)|
| 2:09:31| it is a right-of-way, but it is a right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| that was compromised a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| due to a KUB, a water main break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| that happened in February 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7784)|
| 2:09:48| Anyways, KUB fixed it and it broke again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| in November of that same year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| and there's many pictures of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| But anyways, this two-inch gas main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| was put through the sinkhole that occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| when that water main broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| This is a picture of where the sinkhole was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| and this two-inch gas line is going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7814)|

| 2:10:25| stormwater drain down at Langford and Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| Then it goes through the roots of an 80-year-old oak tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7830)|
| 2:10:37| a very large oak tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| Then it goes through this massive sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| that occurred when KUB did not fix the repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| the first time and after a week of notifying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7846)|
| 2:10:51| that the road was collapsing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| and there was water underneath the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7855)|
| 2:10:59| and the road finally did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7859)|
| 2:11:01| this is when it was starting to collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| This is when it was in the middle of collapsing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7864)|
| 2:11:09| and then, of course, it turned into that major sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7869)|
| 2:11:13| that traveled from where C3 Studios is being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7873)|
| 2:11:21| where the water originally came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| traveled down to 701, crossed Barber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| and then literally blew a sinkhole there by 611.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| Now, this is under the street at Barber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| It's also in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| There's a two-inch gas line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| and I really think that this needs to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| because this is detrimental to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| We know how gas lines can, on occasion, blow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7911)|
| 2:11:56| but this is compromised section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7916)|
| 2:12:02| and I do believe that this needs to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7922)|
| 2:12:07| by KUB, our engineering, to make sure everything is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7927)|
| 2:12:14| The gas line was not supposed to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| It was not in the utility plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7937)|
| 2:12:23| There is, anyways, I think this is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| This is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| It concerns me as this could affect our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7949)|
| 2:12:35| Barber will be greatly traveled by vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7955)|
| 2:12:41| which we didn't want to have happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7961)|
| 2:12:46| but anyways, I do have great concerns for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| I don't know how the gas line got approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7969)|
| 2:12:54| to go up Barber since it wasn't in the original plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7974)|
| 2:12:59| I think that it is definitely compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| There's no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7984)|
| 2:13:05| This is unstable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7985)|
| 2:13:10| Also, there's, why not just close Barber down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| and allow it for pedestrian traffic only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7995)|
| 2:13:18| being as there's, this is definitely compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=7998)|
| 2:13:24| Dawn Michelle Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| Ms. Barber, thank you, your five minutes is up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8006)|
| 2:13:28| but if I, at the end of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| I'll ask Grant Rosenberg, the COO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8011)|
| 2:13:33| to get that information from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| and we'll make sure KUB is aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8014)|
| 2:13:38| Yeah, and thank you for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| Council members, that concludes public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| and without objection, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240402?start=8027)|
