| 0:07:27| conversation about last month at the agenda review. And then finally I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| Dory sent out a invitation or reminder to the staff to the Commission's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=453)|

| 0:07:48| national perspective. We can do that for you at our cost but please let Dory know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| if that was something you're interested in. It will probably fill up your email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:59| accounts a little bit more but that's your choice to whether you'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| join or not on the Tennessee National APA American Planning Association site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=481)|

| 0:08:19| 8A22RZ Marielle Williamson. Yes, thank you. This is in the North City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:26| sector. The size of the tract is approximately 11,827 square feet. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| applicant is asking to go from RN2 or sorry they're asking to go from RN1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| zoning and hillside protection overlay to RN2 zoning and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| overlay. This is where the property is located. You can see a small portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| the site is within the hillside and ridgetop protection area. The majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:58| the surrounding zoning is RN1 and the sector plan and one-year plan both show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:09:08| this area as low-density residential and HP hillside protection. Low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=548)|
| 0:09:15| residential allows consideration of both the RN1 and RN2 zone district. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| this image you can see the lot sizes probably not very clearly but I will let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| you know that they range from 8,000 square feet in size to 10,000. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| one adjacent lot just to the south of this all for single-family residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| that is about 5,500 square feet in size. So the difference between the RN1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| and RN2 zone is that the RN1 requires a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| whereas the RN2 zone district allows minimum lot size of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:10:02| Since this is sort of an infill area in an existing neighborhood, staff is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| recommending to approve the RN2 zoning because it's consistent with the reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| lot sizes that are already smaller than the minimum RN1 zone district and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| allows for a greater range of housing that could be beneficial for infill. RN2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| zoning is relatively nearby about 300 feet to the south. It's also consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| with the sector plan and staff is recommending to approve the RN2 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| and the HP overlay for that reason. Are there any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=640)|
| 0:10:48| Would there be any restrictions on building on that site with the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| and ridge top protection? It's a very small portion of the site and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| look at the site now, let me try to get my pointer out here, this is where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| I would say that's a previously disturbed area. When we toggle back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| where the HP area is, it's right there. It's a very minor previously disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| area. So they could develop the entire property? Well they would be limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:28| the setbacks and lot coverage and all the other dimensional standards of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=688)|
| 0:11:36| zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=696)|
| 0:11:46| Any other questions? Yeah Liz, does, so RN1, if they were to seek a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=706)|

| 0:26:31| was an approved concept plan approved for those areas. So this case there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| never one? No there was and it was from 2006. Did you go back and look at like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| what the restraints were on the development to see if they were still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| applicable? Yeah so that's, I would have, we just passed out a blue sheet for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| one that talks about that. If you look in paragraph two, the most recent use on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| review and concept plan for the site was from 2006 and there were some conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:09| that were recommended as part of that including a site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| requirements that would need to be met on Buffett Mill Road, development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| restrictions related to sinkholes and sanitary sewer connection requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| and there was also a large area that was to remain undeveloped except for one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1645)|
| 0:27:30| single family home on the south side of the property. So they would still have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| meet any transportation standards that the City of Knoxville Engineering Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| requires of them. So if a new development comes in, any access would have to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| the site distance standards for the City of Knoxville as well as any of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| stormwater, other development standards related to development in and around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| sinkholes. They'll also have to comply overall with stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| So on this that was handed out, it's on page two, so if you flip over, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:22| agenda item 10, let's see page is technically 10-2. There, under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:29| comments section, there are two paragraphs. The second one down from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| top is the area that describes the previously approved plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| Okay, all right. So if we remove this C, it's just RN2. With HP overlay. HP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:56| overlay. And then we would see the subdivision plan come before us or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| We would not. Well, yes, sorry, a concept plan and subdivision potentially would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| come through depending on how many lots they try to do. If it's anything over 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| it comes to this body. Right, I guess I'm just presuming it would be over 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| So the C designation, you know, this property, it had a few more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| parcels together under the same ownership at one point, and some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| parcels that are around here still have that C, and obviously they wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| part of this plan. So those would remain as some of those examples of C's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| probably just need to be removed at some point. The removal of the C designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| is for all of these. Well, it's just, but there's like, there's two properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| There's one up in the top left corner that's not part of this. Correct, yeah. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| if it's not part of the application and it's not under the ownership for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| then those would remain. But yes, if they wanted to come through and develop, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1803)|
| 0:30:09| have to look and see what it said for those there, but. They were all part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| the same plan back in 2006. Yeah. Sorry, I don't know what's wrong with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| computer. Is that clear as mud for everyone? So any new development would come in after this C is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1818)|
| 0:30:34| removed, they would have to meet the standards that are in place today, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| with the standards that were in place in 2006. Basically that's really what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| they're trying to do is get rid of the old concept plan, have a fresh start. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| if I understand this, it really just preserves the owner slash developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| rights. It's kind of a transitional tool into the new code, so there's really no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| reason for us to be extra cautious to remove the C. Is that fair to say? Yes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| would say. I mean, it's gonna have to come through if they're developing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| than six lots for concept plan review. So yeah, I mean, I think this body will get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:26| a chance to look at this property again and the regulations in the new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:32| ordinance, you know, related to landscaping and other things for, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| also have to be applied to this, so. And the hillside protection will be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:48| Yes. Liz, a question on when would staff, or what is the staff requirements or for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1908)|
| 0:31:57| either maintaining the C designation or releasing it? Do you have criteria set for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| when you do it? Is it based on how long that plan has been approved and no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| activity occurred, or what's the primary criteria? Hi, I just happen to know this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:20| from having to work a few of these cases prior, but so if there's no plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| the county's law department has said in most cases there will, or sorry, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| city's law department has said in most cases they don't have to come before this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| body to have their C removed. It can be just done sort of administratively. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| there's been a plan attached to it previously, that's when it needs to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| before us. And to Liz's point, you know, the HP area would be retained and if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| had either a concept plan, or I'm sorry, if they either created six or more lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| or created a private right-of-way, then you guys would see it again. If not, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| would have to meet the zoning regulations and the HP. Regarding any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| other criteria, I mean, that's pretty much it. It's just if it has a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| attached previously, it would have to come through. And in most cases we would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| a look at whether or not it is expired or still attached and make our case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| accordingly, if that helps. And we can look at adding criteria, I suppose, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| that's something that you guys felt like was warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| Are most of these, the criteria that's assigned, is that because of the public's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| response to the plan when it was passed or is it staff-related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| Which criteria are you referring to? The standards for evaluating a special use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| No, the ones like that were listed here under the C designation. Oh, previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| The previous conditions? Yeah. They are, it seemed to be primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| engineering-related comments, so related to site distance and their trafficked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2038)|

| 0:34:12| all that are covered under like stormwater and transportation engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| codes that are outside of the zoning ordinance primarily. There was a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2058)|
| 0:34:25| lot that I mentioned that was noted as lot 154 that was to remain undeveloped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| except for maybe one single-family home on that property. So, and it was a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| area to the south of that site. And that, I believe, was an understanding between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| the neighborhood and the developer of the project. That was an agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| they had come to as part of all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| So you think that was the only one that was added because of the response from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| the community? I think that was a major one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:16| The transition here, we'll turn it over to Michelle who's stepping in for Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2116)|

| 0:35:54| It's weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2154)|
| 0:36:06| There we go. Okay, thank you. So first we'll go into case 8SC22C and 8H22DP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2166)|

| 0:36:31| RB and AG and a little bit of RA. So there are a number of variances and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:40| alternative design standards that are requested. Sorry, I don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| slideshow prepared for you today. This is the site plan here. So they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| requesting three variances. The first is to reduce the minimum intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| right-of-way radius from 25 feet to 0 feet on the west side of Road A at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Rifle Range Drive. This is Road A. The second is to reduce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:08| minimum intersection approach vertical curve from K equals 25 to a K value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| 15 on Road A at Rifle Range Drive. This is going to be down here. And the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| is to reduce the minimum intersection separation from 400 feet to 360 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| between the center lines of Road A and Magnum Lane. The alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| standards that are requiring your approval would be the first is reducing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| the minimum private right-of-way width from 50 feet to 40 feet for the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| right-of-way. Reducing the pavement width from 26 feet to 20 feet. And the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| alternative design standard that is approved by Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| well that would be the variances and alternative design request form. So we as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| staff are recommending approval of the variances and alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| standards based on the recommendations of the fact that it's not going to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| a safety hazard. However, after writing this staff report, we learned of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| engineering's wanting to recommend a denial of the variance request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| 2, which is reduction of that minimum intersection approach vertical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| curve from the K value of 25 to the K value of 15. And I'll let Jen Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| speak to that. The conditions that we attached are pretty standard, but one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| that warrants kind of highlighting is providing 50 foot right-of-way connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| to the adjacent property to the west to allow for future public or private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2308)|

| 0:38:55| maximum height of attached dwellings, limiting that to 35 feet. So again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| a 27 lot subdivision. There's 24 attached houses and three detached houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| including the existing house that would remain. The subject property is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2345)|

| 0:39:30| to obtain the site distance that's needed. A new concept approval may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| required if it results in significant changes to the subdivision layout or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2374)|

| 0:40:06| I guess that's the reason for some of the variances is to kind of mitigate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| some of those situations. I'll open it up to any questions. It does meet all their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2409)|

| 0:40:38| arterial and the grade that comes off of rifle range is pretty steep. If we ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2438)|

| 0:40:49| that tie in with the K of 15. So we would potentially work with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| and allow the next success, the next vertical curve down to be reduced where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| he could make up the difference a little bit. So I think we can speak with him on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| that. We've also noticed here, and this is something that the law director's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| office has just recently mentioned, on variance one where it talks about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| reduction of right-of-way radius width from 25 to 0. Mr. Moyers has informed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| recently that we can't approve that variance. That's a, that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| is a minimum requirement. So we as administrative staff can't, can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| actually approve that. That typically happens where the property owner, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| driveway or access is right at the property line and they can't form the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| radius on to the other property because it's another property owner. So that may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| be something that we want to take another look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2505)|
| 0:41:54| So to be clear, just for my mind, that law director says that you as a staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| administration approve that variance. It doesn't require approval from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| Commission, is that what you're saying? I think it's, it says that it shall be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| certain amount. So he says when it's a shall condition, we can't waive that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| requirement. You cannot? Okay, can't, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| I think the next one is that 9A22SU. Okay, so this is also in the county. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2538)|

| 0:42:56| looking at the plans, kind of zoom in a little bit on this here. So this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| facility, technically it is multi-family development for up to 19 dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2583)|
| 0:43:09| And this one is for Helen Ross McNabb. It is going to be a center that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| specifically for women and children that meet the criteria that listed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| their plan of operations. Based on the use, it's defined as a multi-dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| development or apartment complex as defined by the county codes. I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| that highlighted in here. So under their definitions, residential structure types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| it meets this criteria here. So again, the property was rezoned from A to PR with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2610)|
| 0:43:36| up to 8 dwelling units in 2005. Condo development was approved with 73 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| in 2006. And then a revised plan was approved for 64 attached housing townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| in 2009. Again, these are expired, but so this is able to come forth. The units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:55| will be available only for tenants who meet the individualized criterion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2635)|

| 0:44:18| this one back here, that is going to be a seven two-bedroom units. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2658)|
| 0:44:24| for women who have a prior history of substance abuse, but who have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| treatment and are now in recovery. This is not going to be an on-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| treatment facility, nor is it recovery housing. The tenants are free to come and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| go at will, and they provide their own transportation and food. However, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| population will be limited to this demographic, and they must remain sober| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| to qualify for the housing. There will be counseling groups in the common areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| as an accessory use. And so looking at the site plan, it's basically these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| dwelling buildings wrapped around the parking in a common area space. And it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| again multi-dwelling development, and under that criteria it meets all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| requirements for a development plan in the county's ordinance. Any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| about this one? I just have a question about if there are no recovery services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2712)|
| 0:45:20| on-site other than the support group, but someone has to maintain their sobriety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| or maintain their status, who's actually checking on them? Is it an outside case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| manager? That would probably be a question for the applicant. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| who would who would do that. It's not part of the site plans that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2738)|

| 0:45:56| three years, correct? Yes, we did see quite a few of them back-to-back, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| been a while. I thought the ones that we saw previously were recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2760)|
| 0:46:07| It was more specific with a kind of thematic program that was on-site. Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| there's some uses that are kind of related, and so there's different, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| depending on the level of service and how, you know, what exactly it is, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| providing treatment facilities or if it's not, if it's recovery housing or if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| it's not. So there's sort of distinctions and how the zoning ordinance looks at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| that, and so with this one, because they are, you know, already in recovery, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| not receiving any sort of treatment. It can be looked at as a multi-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2791)|

| 0:46:39| kinds of things that you've seen previously that are kind of related but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2799)|

| 0:48:53| urbanized area as defined by the census. Right now, we are still operating back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=2933)|

| 0:54:07| gives us a little bit of that snapshot. So if we look at fiscal year 2021, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3247)|

| 0:54:50| at all of those overall, we added about two million dollars of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3290)|

| 0:55:12| you add the new program in, we're in the sixteen million dollar range, so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| overall fifteen percent revenue, and if you add the one point five, we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| about, I guess that gets us to twenty five percent total increase, but I know a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3322)|

| 0:56:47| we certainly know that those projects do have an impact on land-use decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3407)|

| 0:57:09| we get that? So that is dedicated to the region, so that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| something that will be an additional TPO program fund revenue. There is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| conversation with TDOT about the ultimate programming authority of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| We believe that that is resolved and that that is delegated to the regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3443)|

| 0:57:32| that. We've kind of broken it out as a separate program, but essentially it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| be a new baseline revenue that would be overseen by the TPO executive board. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3456)|

| 0:58:03| kind of monitor them. A lot of them really are kind of being rolled out now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3483)|

| 0:58:24| some that are more appropriate to a regional scale that will be relevant. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3504)|

| 0:59:49| I'll switch over for a moment. So we just kind of grabbed a few and we're at no input again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3589)|

| 1:00:08| A moment ago when I exited and came back in, that helped. I don't know if that will help this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| Okay, I don't know if that's a problem over there again. Close and reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3616)|
| 1:00:30| No input, no input. Any ideas? Shake of the court, hit it on the side, you know, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3630)|

| 1:00:55| Jeff, while he's doing that, what's the balance in the TPO funds from previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| years? I mean, I know way in the past we ran a little, had a little surplus, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| the way things are going, I don't know if that still exists. We typically, in the past, probably somewhere in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3667)|
| 1:01:14| 40 to 50 million dollar range. As Craig will show in a minute, we have two major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3674)|
| 1:01:20| projects that are going to probably eat up that balance almost within with two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| major projects over the next three to five years. So that is primarily why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| are significantly fiscally constrained. What are you dealing with communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| that have money allocated but they're not spending it? We have checks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| balances that we, it's a policy, but it has not been put into effect that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:55| could, the Executive Board could remove a project from a jurisdiction if they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| not make significant progress on implementing that project. So also what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| we have done in the past, with this past time, we've removed projects because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3725)|

| 1:02:19| While we're chit-chatting here, I guess, I'm asking these questions mostly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| because I'm concerned about, you know, our smaller rural communities and, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| even Knox County or Knoxville, in terms of these competitive funds that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3749)|
| 1:02:34| available, you know, who's taking the lead on let's look at the projects that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| able to apply for? You know, if you got a small city that they could have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| awesome project and based on whatever, I know all of the details of how they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| allocating these haven't come out yet, but, you know, they could completely not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| apply for it, right, in a small community, and it could be a win. Yeah, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| there's two, there's our organization that could help them apply for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| funding, and there's also the East Tennessee Development District that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| staff that, you know, prepares or writes grants for local governments, and in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| cases they could partner with TDOT on a particular project. If it was on a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3794)|

| 1:03:22| do something on a state highway, they could potentially partner with TDOT in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| that. You know, we can't obviously, you know, just, hey, write a grant for them just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| because it's a cool idea, you know, and typically they need to know whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| they're one, can they have the local match? Some of these small communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3814)|
| 1:03:38| may not have the required 20% local match, and that's what could be a heavy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| lift for some of the smaller communities. If it was a 10 million dollar project and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| they'd have to come up with two million dollars, their, maybe their annual budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| is only five million dollars a year or something. So, you know, we got to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| sure that they are able to implement, you know, if they were to get the project, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| that's, that's a whole nother story, as Pat was alluded to, is that if some local| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| governments that get a grant or a project and they cannot implement, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| don't have the staff resources. Yeah, and then the other issue too is with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| inflation on construction materials. You know, that, you don't give them any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| than what you've already committed, and a lot of times, I mean, occasionally you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| if you have that ability, but that's on the backs of the local government. So if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| it goes over budget 10%, then the local communities get on that hook for that 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| Are we still having difficulties? We're gonna call an audible and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3875)|
| 1:04:44| something that will be slightly less convenient, but at least it will present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| Now we're going to sacrifice the technology fairies to the gods and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| Yep, so we're gonna go to the online document. I had kind of a subset pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| out, so it was gonna be easier to navigate, but we'll, we'll see the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| online document. Go to page 41, and it won't be that document, but that'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| you close. Maybe go like 48, and then you can see the page number you need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| Yeah, page number 41. So let's see, this is what we're gonna do. Got a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:26| projects that are kind of coming forward from the city. So Pleasant Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| this is a city at Knoxville project that is moving to construction here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| relatively shortly, so reconstructing this project in addition of turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| bike and pedestrian facilities out on here, kind of in that northwest area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| This is a project that's been kind of long gestating, but is finally moving to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| construction. You see a total construction cost there of about five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| and a half million dollars. Again, this is one that's moving forward here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| relatively nearly, and this is what a, what kind of a project page looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| when you look online at the document. So you kind of got some general information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| references to funds that have been previously obligated for earlier phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| of the project, and then that description as well as a project map. And again, kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| of that schedule based on, you know, at a yearly kind of snapshot, and that's based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| on what the local partner anticipates when the funding is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| obligated for construction. So that's saying these funds will be obligated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| construction after October of this year, sometime moving forward, and then you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| got kind of the process of getting the project stood up. So this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| something that, assuming it stays on that schedule, would be moving, you'd see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| in the next construction season, you would be seeing the work beginning on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| this project, assuming it stays on that schedule. And if you have any, feel free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| to jump in with questions at any time. If not, I'll go ahead and proceed on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| next project, which is also a Knoxville project, and this is actually, if you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| back one page to page 40. So Sevier Avenue, this is a project, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4020)|
| 1:07:09| there's been a lot of investments in the South Knoxville, the riverfront area. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| project has also kind of been long gestating, dealing with right-of-way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4034)|

| 1:07:21| project moving forward. It's a project that is moving forward also for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| construction relatively soon as they wrap up the right-of-way project, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| would also anticipate being in construction in the coming 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| construction season. That's the kind of the roundabout from down at where Anita| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4054)|

| 1:07:46| significant improvements to that that street that's obviously... Speak closer to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| you, Mike Craig. Yep, angled, angled Mike, not a good plan. The next one that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| wanted to take a look at is also City Project, page 42. We'll go down. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:08:05| Washington Pike, something a lot of us are familiar with, and this is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| of those ones that is a fairly significant investment, one of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| heavy-hitter projects that's come in for construction phase, and of course this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| related to a lot of the work that's going on out at reusing the East Town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| Mall property with the distribution center that's going out there. So this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| project to make some improvements there to accommodate some of the increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:31| traffic that we're going to see on that corridor right now currently scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| for fiscal 2024 construction, and again I would point out that that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| big number as far as the as a portion of the relative revenue that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| administer throughout the region. Chuck, I have a question about this one, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4126)|
| 1:08:51| there's obviously a lot of construction work already happening on those entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| exit ramps in this area, so is that, tell me how that is divided with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| because this has a 24 date. Sure, so entrance and exit ramps, that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| would be being collaborated through, that's TDOT if you're talking about as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| the bypass goes around 465 or 640. 640. 640, goodness, wrong facility in my head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4152)|

| 1:09:29| addressing TDOT moving forward to make those ramp and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| investments kind of to get that ramped up. This is a little bit further delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| as far as getting the process, of course there's been a lot of interface with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| neighborhoods out there and then we've got to get through the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220906-agenda-review?start=4184)|
