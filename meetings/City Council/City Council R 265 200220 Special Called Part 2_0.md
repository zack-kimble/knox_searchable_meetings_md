| 0:00:00| Good evening, Ms. Wallace, I'll be answering or excuse me, asking your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=0)|
| 0:00:29| If you need me to repeat a question, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| District representatives on City Council are often expected to be advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| Well, I can say with my experience in the past, I have worked to advocate for the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=41)|
| 0:00:53| and worked towards answers that take into consideration everyone's thoughts and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=53)|
| 0:01:00| ideas and their process, but also working towards the larger goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| That's been how I was able to manage the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Project, where we often found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=65)|
| 0:01:12| different stakeholders and property owners had differences of opinion about what should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| And so by working with each of them and helping them to understand what the goals were and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| sharing the information about why it was important to move forward in a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=83)|
| 0:01:28| many of those folks came back to the process feeling like they were engaged and feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=88)|
| 0:01:33| like they had been heard, and then being able to put that forward into the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=93)|
| 0:01:40| And so as an advocate, I would seek to listen to all of the stakeholders involved in a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=100)|
| 0:01:48| work to mitigate any conflicts that arose, and then move forward with a decisive decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=108)|
| 0:01:55| in the best interest of the majority and those involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=115)|
| 0:02:04| Council Member Welch announced her intent to resign on December 9, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| District representatives on City Council are expected to be accessible and responsive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=129)|
| 0:02:13| their district, as well as to the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| Can you please detail ways you personally have reached out or made yourself available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| for District 1 residents and neighborhood associations since Council Member Welch's announcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| So I think most of you all know I came to the party a little bit later than several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| of the applicants who are here tonight, and that was very intentional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| One of my concerns was having been a recent city employee, I didn't want to put my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| in the hat and divide the vote if I wasn't going to be eligible to fulfill the seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| And that was not clear until the Council Workshop where rules were set forth as to what constituted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=164)|
| 0:02:50| eligibility for this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| So from that point in time, I've reached out to a number of the merchants associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| including Cumberland Avenue Merchants, the North Knoxville Business and Professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Association, the Sevier Avenue Merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| Those are all groups that I have participated with previously as a city staff member and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=185)|
| 0:03:09| continue to participate with even after having left the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| I'm also working with the Broadway Quarter Task Force and the Uptown North Branding Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| So really and truly making an effort to be available through those large groups, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| also individually, reaching out to members of the community, talking with neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| folks who are concerned about our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| I've sent out several emails, made several phone calls, as I'm sure all of my compatriots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| have as well, and had the opportunity to meet with most everyone on City Council and reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| out to every member of the Council here prior to tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| And so I think being accessible and available is something that would be very easy for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Renters represent a majority of our city, yet our neighborhood organizations are comprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| primarily of homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| In your role as a member of Council, how would you work to ensure the voices and priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| of District 1 residents who are renters or houseless are reflected in the policies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| spending priorities of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| Well, first and foremost, I've worked with the Fort Sanders Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| for a number of years, and really when we first started the Cumberland Avenue Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| Project, we actually did a Fort Sanders UT Quality of Life Committee and invited stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| to that process, who obviously, many of which are renters because of the nature of the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| And we worked with the Office of Neighborhoods to look at ways to engage folks who are renters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| in the area and also to figure out ways that we can help keep the landlords accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| Often in the Fort Sanders neighborhood, the property is owned by someone who lives out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| of town, and so maintenance issues can sometimes go unaddressed for long periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| We were working on things like looking at a landlord registration for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| and doing a pilot program in the Fort Sanders neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| The political will at the time was not there to move that forward, but it was certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| something that was thought about and considered and I think might be something that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| be appropriate to look at as we see rental communities increasing, especially with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| nature of the shift in our housing stock to more renters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| In terms of providing additional housing for low income or folks who may be homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| I think it is critical for us as the city of Knoxville to continue to work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| partners that have been established and new partners coming to the table to provide accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| housing and opportunities for housing for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| Sometimes folks won't be able to take advantage of that or choose not to take advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| that, but we certainly, as local government, have a responsibility to provide for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| opportunity to be available to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| As a council member, we are called on to represent varied viewpoints that may not be in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| with our own personal viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| Give an example where you have been collaborative in solving a problem with people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| opposing viewpoints from yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Well, I'll go back to the example of the Cumberland Avenue Corridor project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| When we first started that project, there were several folks who were unfamiliar with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| the goals of the project and walked into a meeting with a property owner who was candidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| quite hot, as I'm sure you all have experienced in your roles when people deal with investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| and something comes along to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=405)|
| 0:06:47| Change can be very scary, but what I was able to do in that particular situation was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| to fall back on the information, the public process that had been carried on to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| and to inform them that our goal in making the changes to Cumberland Avenue was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| to increase the value of their property and to make it more valuable for them in the long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Certainly, once that aha moment was translated to that particular individual, he came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| and said, oh, so you're not trying to drive me out of business, you're actually trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| to make it so that my property is more valuable in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| The happy ending of that story was that he actually did decide to sell his property shortly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| after the completion of the construction of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| He ended up buying property in South Knoxville and is actually doing a very exciting project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| adjacent to the Baker Creek development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| It did very much work in his favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| In terms of collaboration, I think one of the best things is to be able to present clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| and concise, accurate information, and share that with people in a way that is easily understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| and that they can be a part of that dialogue and that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| While we may not always agree, if we can respect the reasons why decisions are getting made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| then I think we go a long way to finding common ground and being able to make some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| Since diversity is a valuable thing on City Council, please share with us what perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| or experience you possess that is not already represented on this current City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| Well, candidly, the simplest answer is I'm a former city staff person, so I've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| here with all the different departments, had interaction with the department heads, know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| the different resources that are available to the city staff and how to access those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| folks and be able to get answers in a quick and timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| I've also had an opportunity to come to the table from a planning perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| My background is as a certified planner and a landscape architect, and having that education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| has really helped me to be able to see the city through a different set of eyes than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| most people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| I can look at a 30,000-foot view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| I can also look at the two-foot view and understand where it might be helpful to make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| or adjustments in order to bring about a betterment for the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| So I think those two things would be an asset and a value to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=548)|
| 0:09:16| Land use in the city is an important issue and a limited commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| Uses can be both conflicting and competing with a great deal of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=566)|
| 0:09:30| How will you approach difficult zoning decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| Well, again, as a professional planner, I've had the opportunity to look at writing zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| ordinances, going through the process with actually the Cumberland Avenue Corridor District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| to create a whole new form-based code for them in order to increase the density and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=584)|
| 0:09:51| the value of that property over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| One of the things that I found very valuable through that process was, again, connecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| with individuals, making sure they had accurate information, working through those problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| and questions so that they felt like they understood exactly what it was they were buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| by supporting or being against that zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| I also had the opportunity as staff to review the recode document in every single edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| So I think I've read it almost as many times as some of the council members here and candidly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| can say that zoning is never perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| It's a tool and it should be used carefully and it should have dialogue and input, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| when challenging decisions are getting made, especially when there is a potential conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| between two different types of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| But it is a tool that does help to prevent the worst from happening and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| critically important to our community as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| How does public safety rank on your list of priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| What are your opinions on the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| What should change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| What should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Well, that's a whole series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| First and foremost, the city of Knoxville is chartered to provide police and fire services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| to its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| It's also chartered to pick up garbage and provide for the safety and welfare of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| So from that perspective, I think it's absolutely critical that our police department be well-funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| and well-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| They provide a role, candidly, at a pay rate that most people won't accept for the level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=683)|
| 0:11:30| of danger that they encounter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| But I'm very supportive of our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| I believe Chief Thomas is doing an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| I've had the opportunity to work with her when she was actually the head over the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| We met on several occasions with my work on the downtown wayfinding system and through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| my work with the CBID prior to Rick Emmett taking that role for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| So I've had a chance to interact with the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| I've worked with several of the captains in the different areas that I've worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| Captain Jones and Thomas Clinton worked very closely with the Cumberland Avenue Merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Association and also several officers have participated regularly with the Central Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| Corridor because of the nature of the challenges that are faced on those corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| So in general, I support the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| And I would ask, Will, what are the last two questions in that series?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| The last two questions are what should change, what should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Well, I think there's positive movement in terms of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| Every group has people who are going to be frontrunners and have the most integrity and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| And every group is going to have folks who maybe don't live up to the standards and expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| I think by providing the body cameras and by providing accountability through that approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| it's going to yield better service for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| So I think that's a positive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| And I think that should continue moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| And what should stay the same is the quality of the people that we hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| There's a lot of vetting that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| And it's a really hard job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| And I very much respect those who take that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Seattle has the same serious issues as the rest of the country, homelessness, poverty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| low wages, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| What is your role in addressing these topics on a city level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Well, I think we are tasked with figuring out how to best utilize our resources through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| the budgets that we have available to provide opportunity for folks to overcome circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| that they find themselves in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Oftentimes, people end up in a situation of homelessness because of a medical condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| or a mental health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Unfortunately, our state has moved away from providing a lot of the mental health services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| that were available several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| And I think what we've seen in terms of the homeless population is a lot of those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| are from those institutions and not being able to function in normal society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| There are a number of agencies that have come in to fill the gap and try and make things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| better for those who are experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| I serve on the United Way Income and Investment Committee, and we get to see a lot of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| folks who are doing good work in our community to meet that need as they are partners with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| the United Way and working for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| There's always more that we can do, and I certainly think that we should prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| providing opportunity and access for people who are dealing with homelessness or on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| verge of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| And truly, studies have found that if we can help someone cover a gap and maintain being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| in their home, that goes a long way to keeping them in housing, whereas if they were to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| homelessness for a period of time, that tends to perpetuate itself in a negative direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| And so if we can find ways to stop the gap from happening by utility assistance or renter's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| assistance or other programs, I think those are solid ways that we can lend a helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| hand and prevent things from going to the point where we end up with someone who's chronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=908)|
| 0:15:13| homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| As a member of City Council, what role do you believe you should play in helping our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| city achieve racial equity and address lingering historic disparities that have resulted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| a 42% poverty rate in our black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| Well, I think it is our responsibility, similarly with the homelessness issue, to provide opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| and to provide access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| I think we can certainly do more to bring diversity to our neighborhoods and support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| diversity in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| And I think we have opportunities as leaders of this community to go out and engage the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| next generation and to invest in them and help them see that the possibilities are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| front of them and provide access to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| I've had opportunity to work with some students at the University of Tennessee and interns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| through the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association and helping folks understand what the possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| are and that they have more choices and options is really critical to the next generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| finding success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| In terms of dealing with the disparities that have happened already, I think first and foremost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| it happens at a personal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Being willing to see someone and listen to them and give them respect that's due to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| because they are a person and not to assume about someone else but to really get to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| them is a really good step in helping to break down those barriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| I have the privilege of participating in a bilingual Bible study at my church and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| been getting to know folks from a variety of countries who are here in the city who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| are working hard and trying to earn a living and getting to know them personally has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| a world of difference in my understanding about their needs and their expectations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| what I might be able to do to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| What three steps would you take to ensure the future of our city is in a firm financial footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| Well that's a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| Candidly I think one of the key areas that we have to look at is looking for opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| to reinvest in vacant and blighted and brownfield properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| There are problem properties throughout the city that if we were able to find grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| for if we were able to partner with the ownership that we could really turn those around and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| have them be income producing as opposed to a detriment on the properties around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| and dragging the values down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| I think that's critical to increasing the tax base especially since we cannot annex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| property involuntarily anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| I think the other elements would be to work on providing more jobs and job creation especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| in a variety of areas helping folks to understand the value of the trades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| Pellissippi State has some wonderful community projects where they really try and encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| people to go into the trades programs and those are services that tend to be undervalued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| but they are often good paying jobs that help our economy and provide stable living for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| our residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| So I would encourage more collaboration especially with the program where the governor has put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| into place the free two years of community college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| And thirdly, I think we need to continue to market ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| Unfortunately we sometimes suffer from jealousy of our surrounding cities, oh if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| be like Asheville or oh if we had the gig network of Chattanooga, but we have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:06| of really wonderful assets right here, the urban wilderness, our hospitality, the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| River, the state's land grant institution, the University of Tennessee, partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| with Oak Ridge, and so I think we should do a better job of marketing ourselves and branding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1158)|
| 0:19:25| ourselves as a welcoming community that really is excited about what we have to offer everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| That's the conclusion of my questions but Council may have follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Certainly, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Ms. Wallace, I have a follow-up question if you will briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| This seat will be on the ballot next year, whether you're the successful candidate tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| or not, would you seek election in 2021?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| Candidly, I am currently working towards full-time employment elsewhere and one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| that I would like to do is to see how this process goes and how I'm able to balance the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| demands because I understand very clearly after having talked with you all about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| amount of time and attention and careful attention that this job requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| I am ready, willing, and able to serve for the conclusion of this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| I would want to make a determination at the end of that time as to whether or not it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| be in the best interest of everyone to continue serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1228)|

| 0:20:33| In regards to the budget, what do you think we should be spending more money on and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| order to pay for that, what needs to be cut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| A really good question and candidly, I heard you ask the question to my predecessor in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| the application here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| It's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| It really is to prioritize one thing over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| I would say that we do have some critical crises that are facing us such as affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| housing shortage, recognizing that we need to be able to provide opportunity and options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:12| We also need to look for ways to work with our existing neighborhoods to keep what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| currently affordable housing affordable in the future and that deals with a lot of complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| issues such as gentrification, such as devaluation of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| I think we definitely need to continue to grow our focus towards providing affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| What gets cut is a very difficult decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| I think what I would say is, are there opportunities that we could seek funding offers outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| of the city coffers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| For example, are there federal grants, are there state grants, are there opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| to partner with foundations or private companies to help cover some of those gaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| Can we do some public-private partnerships that would really strategically help in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| areas so that we're not having to look at simply the capital improvement program to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| fund all of these initiatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I would certainly have experience in going after grants and writing grant applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| and I would certainly love to bring that to the table if this moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1337)|

| 0:23:20| District representatives on city council are often expected to be advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Well, I'll be an advocate for the community, whether or not the community's position reflects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1408)|
| 0:23:35| my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| Over the course of my career as a public servant, I found myself in many positions where I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:45| necessarily agree with either the law or with the situation that was presented before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| However, it's not up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| We have a set of laws, a set of rules that we have to abide by, you know, a set of morals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| and a set of ethics and I will absolutely uphold those and I will uphold those as best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:13| as possible to support the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| I'm more than happy to listen to any perspective, argue the pros and cons of both sides of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1459)|
| 0:24:32| sit down, talk to people, listen to their perspective and learn from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| And once I feel like we've got all of the available information, hopefully we can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| together and lead the community together with a common response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1483)|

| 0:25:02| their district as well as to the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1502)|

| 0:25:15| Since her announcement, I'll be honest with you, I haven't done a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| It wasn't until the closing week for this position that I made the determination that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:30| I was going to be able to fulfill the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1530)|

| 0:27:07| Well, I think the first answer to that is I would like to not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| The people who I talk to, the people who I would engage with at the community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| that I would hold, isn't a question that I would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1640)|
| 0:27:25| I wouldn't know whether you were a homeowner, whether you were a renter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| As far as engagement with the homeless population, you know, those are the people that I talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| to every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| You know, I've spent hours over the course of my last rotation at work speaking to members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:54| of the homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| I'm pretty well in tune with the two separate classes of homeless people, the transitional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| homeless, and the chronically homeless, and I recognize that there are two completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| different sets of needs for both of those populations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| And just through the recognition that it's not a single group, you know, that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1696)|
| 0:28:25| two different types of homeless people who have different needs, I would certainly be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| willing to listen and advocate for both because they both do have separate needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1711)|
| 0:28:42| As a council member, we are called on to represent varied viewpoints that may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| in line with our own viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Give an example where you have been collaborative in solving a problem with people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| opposing viewpoints from yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1733)|
| 0:29:05| I think one of the best examples that I could give you is through social media exchanges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:11| that I've had with people both within and outside of our community in relation to policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| People tend to have their own particular preconceived notions of what I do as a law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1766)|

| 0:29:36| I've generally, when I have a conflict with someone on social media, well conflict probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| isn't the right word, but a heated discussion with people on social media, I refer back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| to facts, statistics, tangible evidence of what we can prove versus what we think and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1790)|
| 0:30:04| what we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| And I do my best not to let emotions run the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| Since diversity is a valuable thing on city council, please share with us what perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1814)|

| 0:31:10| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1870)|

| 0:31:23| Well, I think that individual property rights must be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:33| While I certainly recognize the role of eminent domain, I feel that it should be an absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| last ditch effort as a solution to a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| I think that the rightful owners of the property should be able to determine its use within reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1904)|
| 0:31:55| And that we as a city sometimes should do a little better job of minding our own business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| and letting people do what they choose with their own property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| How does public safety rank on your list of priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| What are your opinions on the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| What should change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| What should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:21| Well, you know, as a career public servant, someone who has worked both, well, actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1941)|

| 0:32:38| But I have a high opinion of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| You know, this conversation comes up regularly in our Police Benevolent Association meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| Knoxville has some of the best pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1970)|

| 0:33:06| People should be knocking down the door to join the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| But they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And we have to ask ourselves why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| If we have all of these benefits, if we have all of the money, we have the high call volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| that people who are new into the profession are really interested in, why aren't we getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| those applicants here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| And I think the answer to that question is there's some hostility between the Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| Department and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| I think that the city as a whole, not just the Police Department's administration, bears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| the responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| I think that given an opportunity to engage better with segments of our community who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2034)|
| 0:34:08| don't necessarily care for our police officers and the department, I think that we certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| have plenty of room to grow, plenty of bridges that we could build that would make Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2056)|
| 0:34:24| a more attractive place for people to come into a law enforcement career and a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| place for people who live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| Knoxville has some serious issues as the rest of the country, homelessness, poverty, low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| wages, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| What is your role in addressing these topics on a city level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| I think most importantly, as a city leader, I would be focused on sustainable growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2086)|
| 0:35:00| And by sustainable growth, what I mean is we can't take off in one direction and expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| to grow like we have in South Knoxville with our urban wilderness and develop all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:14| trails, all of these opportunities for recreation, but not grow the Fire Department, not grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2114)|
| 0:35:22| the Police Department, not put better water lines in in the area through our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| We have to grow that infrastructure with us as we grow to keep us from a situation like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:39| recently happened in Flint, Michigan, where they had let their water lines go for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| without proper maintenance and citizens of the city have been without clean water for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Things like that matter over the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| We have to temper our growth and make sure that all of the infrastructure necessary grows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| As a member of City Council, what role do you believe you should play in helping our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| city achieve racial equity and addressing lingering historic disparities that have resulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| in a 42% poverty rate in our black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| Well, I think that while it's important to remember our past, it's important to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:36| injustices that have occurred, that our focus needs to be not on what divides us, but what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2196)|
| 0:36:46| brings us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| You know, what we can do as a city to increase employment in those, excuse me, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2210)|
| 0:37:04| in those sectors that are underrepresented to make Knoxville a better place for us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:15| What three steps would you take to ensure the future of our city is on a firm financial footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| Well first and foremost, again, I believe that the key to our sustained growth is maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2242)|
| 0:37:29| of our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| You know, I think that if we let that go, kick the ball down the road a few years on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| a road project here and a water project there, we really set ourselves up for fiscal disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| I think that after we've doubled down on the infrastructure that we control, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| we have to reach out to our partners that are responsible for the management of other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| infrastructure in the area, like our school system with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| You know, if I were going to pick a new city to go live in, or if I were going to pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| a new city to open a new business, I would want to know, does it have good schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2292)|
| 0:38:20| I would want to know, does it have, I mean, is it safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Does it have a good crime rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| Does it have good roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| And then, I'd want to know, how are my taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| I think we need to do our best to manage the value of the penny as it pertains to our tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2315)|
| 0:38:48| I think that we need to do everything that we can to keep our taxes as low as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| not only on our residents, but on businesses that we attract, and consider tax increment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| financing and other options to attract new business in the area to stimulate growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:13| That ends my questions, but Council may have follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| On the first question regarding advocacy work, you said that you would be willing to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:31| the community even if it was something that you disagreed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Well, there are many different communities, so which one would you, I mean, there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| general philosophy that we feel committed to one community or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| I mean, it's not always opposites, but I can make one vote and one community is very happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2386)|
| 0:39:52| and one community is very upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| So you're always going to be advocating against someone in a sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| So you have to decide where you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| So where do you start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Which community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Well, I mean, obviously, my role would be the 1st District and to represent the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:12| District's interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Granted, you know, there are two distinct parts of the 1st District, South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| and Fort Sanders, both of them with their own problems, both of them with their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| community groups, you know, both of them with their own special interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| And yes, it's absolutely impossible to make all of the people happy all of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| You know, my guiding principle would be what does the greatest good for the greatest number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:44| One more question on, I guess, when we're talking about what we can do to better our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| financial situation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| You were saying better roads, better schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| At the same time, you were saying less taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| So you're putting a priority there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| So if you had, we all have to choose constantly, what do we want to do with our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| What would you want to spend more money on and what would you be willing to cut out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Not cut, but lessen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| To de-emphasize, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Well, you know, it's going to depend on a sliding scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| You know, what's in the worst shape today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| What can we kick down the road for another budget year and address next time around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:33| But ultimately, at the end of the day, on those issues of our infrastructure, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| those should come before anything else that, you know, any other projects in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| Because without those things, the city's not a safe place for any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:55| Can we get by with 5% less firemen one year, 5% less policemen one year, a few miles road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2515)|
| 0:42:05| paved less one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Certainly, I think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| But we have to be responsive to the issues before us at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| You know, if we're having a lot of unrest, you know, we need to prioritize the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2536)|
| 0:42:25| If we're having a lot of fire and EMS related problems, you know, like we've seen recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| EMS-wise with the opioid crisis and the amount of overdoses that we deal with on a daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| We don't need to cut the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| We need those people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| We need the police there, you know, anybody that can show up to administer Narcan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| We need those people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So yeah, can we deal with a couple of extra potholes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| If we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Actually, my question was about the opioid crisis and you hit upon that some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| Would you like to expand on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| I know it's a national problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| It's a state problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| What do you see that city officials can do to help alleviate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| It's a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Addiction has always been a complicated issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| However, up until opioids became the drug of choice, we weren't seeing anywhere near| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2602)|
| 0:43:34| as many overdose-related deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| We were, when stimulants were the problem and we were dealing with people with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:45| type of a cocaine overdose or a methamphetamine overdose, those people were having a heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| They were calling an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| We were taking them to the hospital and they would either get better or not at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| and it wasn't something that we saw on the streets as an immediate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2637)|
| 0:44:05| Opioids have changed the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| You know, it's a contentious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| There are a lot of people that question whether or not law enforcement, for instance, should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2654)|

| 0:44:28| I believe absolutely if you can save a life, you should, no matter who you are, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| it's your responsibility or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| But at the same time, some of the laws that have been passed at the state level have kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| of shot us in the foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| There's, in the last legislature, there was a law passed that said that if we responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| to an overdose case as law enforcement and we found drug paraphernalia at the scene,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:59| we could not charge that criminally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| The reason for that was, which makes perfect sense, we don't want people to not call for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| help for fear of catching some kind of misdemeanor criminal charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| However, you know, there's an old saying that when the only tool that you have is a hammer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:28| every problem looks like a nail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Well, as law enforcement, that's kind of the position that we've been painted into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| We've become the problem solver for a lot of community issues, and wrongfully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| We've absorbed the problems that we don't really have anybody else to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| And the only thing that we can do is to get these people in the system, which is the absolute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:57| wrong thing to do, but it's the only tool we have available to try to get them some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| help and get them off of the opioids before they end up killing themselves and devastating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2762)|
| 0:46:09| their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| Just one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| You mentioned that the issues in Fort Sanders may be different from the issues in the further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| south in the 1st District, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| What issues do you see that are different to the Fort Sanders neighborhood, and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| ideas do you have to address those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| Well, I think one of the biggest issues right now in the Fort Sanders area is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:40| People adjusting to the Cumberland Avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| We've created some infrastructure problems there where the fire truck at Station 9 can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2805)|
| 0:46:54| make the turn from 17th Street onto Cumberland Avenue, which used to be their primary route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| to a lot of the calls that they answer, particularly fire alarms at UT Hospital, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2821)|
| 0:47:10| And they've had to create workarounds, find new routes that are a few minutes, maybe longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2830)|
| 0:47:23| in their response times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Traffic calming issues, speed bumps, roundabouts, you name it, all of those things slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2845)|
| 0:47:36| our emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:37| I saw a study here recently that every speed bump slows down a fire truck's response by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:46| 15 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| And that doesn't sound like a lot until you think, you know, if you've got three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| speed bumps, it's tacking a minute or so onto your response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| If you're waiting for that help to arrive, that minute seems like an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| Councilwoman Tranker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Nursing can be a very taxing profession to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| And I know a lot of our officers here in Knoxville find themselves working long hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| And so I was just wondering how, if you could give us a sense of how much time you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:31| say you spend in Anderson County each day or each week versus South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| I work a 40-hour week, just like everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| The way that I work that is I work 12-hour days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| One week I'll work Monday, Tuesday, have Wednesday, Thursday off, work Friday, Saturday, Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| The next week I'll work just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| So I am out of South Knoxville as much as I would be if I worked at an insurance agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2937)|
| 0:49:07| in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| No more, no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| Just to clarify, I don't work a lot of overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| I actually try my best to avoid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| I've been doing this for a long time, and I would much rather have my time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Mr. Bratley, last question, please, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| This seat will actually be on the ballot in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| So whether you're the successful candidate tonight or not, would you seek election to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| this seat in 2021?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| I honestly don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| I am a reluctant candidate to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| I considered at one point running for office several years ago, but I'm a leader who likes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=2992)|
| 0:50:00| to lead from the rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| I don't like to be out front and, you know, hey, look at me, look what I've done, look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| how I've helped you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| I've always been more of a, hey, look what you guys have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| And that really isn't the successful formula for being a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:22| Not that there's anything wrong with either, it's just the path that I've chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| So I think that transitioning to an election cycle versus an appointment would be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| It certainly isn't something that I've ruled out, but I can't tell you a hundred percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| that yes, if I were offered the position tonight, that I would run again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Counsel, at this time, I'd like to ask you to take a break now or after the next interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| because I think once we go, we, seventh interview, we will go directly into the voting cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:07| So would we like to break for about 10 to 15 minutes now or after the next candidate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| I would like to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| Can we just say no more than 10 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| I mean, we're just taking a bathroom break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Yeah, let's do a 10 minute then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| We'll recess for 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| If I can have your attention, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| We're calling the meeting back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| Take your seats, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:55| Ms. Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| It's my bedtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Well, I'm getting to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3126)|
| 0:52:14| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| It's Ms. Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I'll be asking your questions this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| If you need me to repeat a question, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| District representatives on city council are often expected to be advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| I will be a citywide advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| I will be an advocate for the first district, because that is the constituents that I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| be representing and I will be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| However, I will not only be an advocate for the first district, it is a citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| We rise together as a city and by working as an advocate for all city districts, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3168)|
| 0:52:58| that is the way that Knoxville is going to continue to evolve toward being better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| I know each district has different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| I've talked to each of you that represent a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| You all have different issues and I think that if we can all advocate together for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| different districts, then again, the city will be better for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| What was the rest of that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| It's like, how would you advocate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| And the, so again, citywide advocate and why is because I believe in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| I believe in a community that works together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| This is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| So, still got 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| You don't have to take it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Council Member Welch announced her intent to resign on December 9, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| District representatives on City Council are expected to be accessible and responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| to their district, as well as to the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3241)|

| 0:54:10| residents and neighborhood associations since Council Member Welch's announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| Specifically for the district, the first district, I have gone to various neighborhood association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3262)|

| 0:54:48| more about the process, what goes on with the city and how that department interacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| with the City Council and vice versa, how City Council interacts with the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| This is what I have done since December 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| I do want to explain a little bit about how I plan to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| Stephanie Welch and Carson Daly and Christy Christy, on a yearly basis, have a district-wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:17| meeting where people come and can ask questions and there is a state of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:24| I plan to work with Carson Daly and Christy Christy to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| I will continue to be going to the neighborhood association meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| It is where you find out a lot of the differing issues that are happening in each of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:44| While South Knoxville is one district, each neighborhood has its own unique challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| By going to the neighborhood association meetings, I will continue doing that and being accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| via phone, email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Renters represent the majority of our city, yet our neighborhood organizations are comprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| primarily of homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| In your role as a member of council, how would you work to ensure the voices and priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:13| of District 1 residents who are renters or houseless are reflected in the policies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| spending priorities of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3378)|
| 0:56:23| I know with my neighborhood that there are a lot of renters in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| For my neighborhood, I can speak to what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| We do deliver flyers for our meetings to each and every household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| We encourage people that are not only homeowners but also renters to come to our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:44| association meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| By encouraging renters, even though they oftentimes are not as vested as homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3406)|
| 0:56:54| they live in the neighborhood and the surroundings affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| They are part of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| By encouraging them to be a part, we are stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| We do have several affordable housing or workforce housing developments that are going in in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| I think going specifically to these places where there are renters and encouraging them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| to become a part of the community, again, we are stronger together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| Did I answer all the questions there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| Can you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Renters represent the majority of our city, yet our neighborhood organizations are comprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| primarily of homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| In your role as a member of council, how would you work to ensure the voices and priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3461)|

| 0:57:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Again, per my opening statement, I'm very aware of or would like to see a lot of inclusiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3472)|
| 0:58:03| and diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| I would work with other organizations, especially with the homeless, to bring people to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| table so that everyone has a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| As a council member, we are called on to represent varied viewpoints that may not be in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| with our own personal viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| Give an example where you have been collaborative in solving a problem with people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| opposing viewpoints from yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:38| I think that one of the biggest areas that I had an opposing viewpoint from others in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:48| the neighborhood was with the continuation of the James White Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| There was a lot of division in South Knoxville and even with Sevier County as far as whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3533)|
| 0:59:04| that should be continued or whether it should be stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| My viewpoint was not the same as a lot of people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| I think what you do is you bring people to the table, you be respectful, you let everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| have an opportunity to hear their voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| You're not always going to have the direction of what the outcome is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:32| It's not always going to be what you have wanted, but I think that if you have listened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3572)|
| 0:59:39| to people honestly and allow everybody to have a voice and hear people and then come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:46| to a decision, you have to weigh the issues and the information that you have and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| the best decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Since diversity is a valuable thing on City Council, please share with us what perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| or experience you possess that is not already represented on this current City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3601)|
| 1:00:07| Well, looking at the City Council, I am a homeowner in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:25| That's not represented on the City Council right now, so that would be one point of diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| I really don't have a good answer for any other way that I have diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:43| The Council is well put together, but I really don't have any other way that I have diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3643)|
| 1:00:51| with what is on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| Land use in the city is an important issue and a limited commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Uses can be both conflicting and competing with a great deal of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| How will you approach difficult zoning decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3669)|
| 1:01:17| Zoning decisions are made based on community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| We're a little bit past time to have a South City sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| I'm assuming that we're talking about all over the entire city, not just South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| Each city has a sector plan where the community comes together and decides what do they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| The zoning that is put in on within each area needs to align with the land use that is defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| by the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| I think that with the recode ordinance, there has been a lot of land that has been looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| at as far as what has been the land use and what can be the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| I applaud some of the map changes to make a lot more mixed use areas, zoning areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3725)|
| 1:02:14| The mixed use is going to allow for some more economic development, more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:28| How does public safety rank on your list of priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| What are your opinions on the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| What should change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| What should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Public safety is very high on my priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| We have to have a safe city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| We have to have a city where people feel safe to be able to walk out on the street, to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:48| out and sit on their porch, to be able to go to the shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| So public safety is very high on my priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| I applaud what the council has decided with regards to the body cams for the police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3776)|
| 1:03:04| I think that that is a very important step toward accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:13| I also agree very much with the recruiting tool that the police department is putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:23| in place to bring in more officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| Right now, our officers are working two and three shifts at a time, which makes them tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| They're not getting enough rest in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| And so I think that by having additional officers on staff will help make our towns more safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:45| Knoxville has the same serious issues as the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Homelessness, poverty, low wages, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| What is your role in addressing these topics on a city level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| As city council, we need to look at ways to put in permanent supportive housing for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| that are homeless or displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| In talking to community development, just having 60 additional beds for the chronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3849)|
| 1:04:16| homeless will put a real dent in the homeless population that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| I think that city council supporting the initiatives to have additional resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:32| find areas of the city where we can do, whether it is affordable housing, workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| or permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| And I'm sorry, could you ask that question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| Knoxville has the same serious issues as the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| Homelessness, poverty, low wages, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| What is your role in addressing these topics on a city level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Okay, and then poverty and low wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| We do have job deserts within Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| We have areas within Knoxville that we have people that are living, and the jobs are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| where they're living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| So I think part of our poverty issue is being able to get people to the jobs, the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:23| that want to work getting them to their jobs, whether it is working with CAT to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:29| bus passes to get people to jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| But I think that that would go a long way toward helping people that are in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| As a member of city council, what role do you believe you should play in helping our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| city achieve racial equity and address lingering historic disparities that have resulted in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| a 42% poverty rate in our black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| And what, the question, what role should city council play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| What role do you believe you should play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| And what role I should play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| I believe that my role would be to work with city council to find answers, bring the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3969)|
| 1:06:18| together, bring people together to the table and find what is the reason for there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| 42% poverty rate in the black community, and what can we do as a city to start supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3984)|
| 1:06:32| these people, bring them the resources that will help bring them, bring things in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| to be an equitable position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| But it is up to city council, I believe, and myself as a member of city council to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Again, getting people to jobs, getting people transportation, and a lot of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4012)|
| 1:07:04| What three steps would you take to ensure the future of our city is on a firm financial footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:14| One of the, we do have a, there is a concern about the financial footing because, number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:25| one, the revenue is currently flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| We are going to be losing the hall income tax, which is a boost for the capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| I think for, to make sure that the city is on a firm financial footing is to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| We've got, there are brownfields that could be redeveloped with mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| Again, I'm very strong on mixed use development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| It provides not only opportunities for retail, for businesses, but also for some residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4076)|
| 1:08:08| that is affordable residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| I think being very careful with our expenditures and really taking a look at how budget items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:27| are affecting the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| That concludes my questions, but council may have follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| You mentioned recode and mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| Of course, you'll be primarily representing the first district, but we have corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4121)|
| 1:08:45| of course, that extend into every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| How do you see the implementation of recode making changes along these corridors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:57| I met with Vice Mayor McKenzie yesterday going along Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| I've always loved Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| It's a stately boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| I see many areas where there is some opportunity, again, for whether it's mixed use, but opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:22| for small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| It takes one business, it takes two businesses to start putting together, maybe putting flowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| out, maybe upgrading their facade to start having other businesses say that's a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4170)|
| 1:09:38| beautiful spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| I know that the land along Magnolia has been rezoned to allow much more mixed use development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:55| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| Again, it's going to mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| I have a question for you very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| As you know, this council seat will be up for re-election in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Whether you are the successful candidate this evening to fill this vacancy and this appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| or not, would you seek election in 2021?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| I have not decided whether I would seek election or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| I feel very strongly that anyone that should fill this seat should be very accountable to the constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4223)|
| 1:10:33| I believe if someone were to say that they would fill this seat and not run for re-election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| that makes them accountable to no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| By saying that I may run for re-election, it does make me accountable to the people that I would be serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:49| I don't want anybody that is filling the seat to be a seat warmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4249)|
| 1:11:00| On the question about police, and you were saying that we need to have public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| and you were equating it with police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| What about the idea that for some people that's not safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| Can you think of other ways that we can increase public safety?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| Because we are having trouble recruiting the police anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| Public safety also comes from strong neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:27| Strong neighborhoods start watching out for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| I know when our neighborhood association started, I didn't know our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| I didn't know the people across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| But by building strong neighborhoods, we're making neighborhoods safer because we're watching out for each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| And you're right, as far as public safety, I'm sorry, my mind went in one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| But again, it is looking out for each other through neighborhood associations is mostly where I would say that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4310)|
| 1:12:01| Then one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| Talking about getting renters involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| It's really difficult right now to get the information out to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| We all listen to our own news sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| We go to where we want the information from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| What are some ideas you have on getting more citizens involved in the community aware of what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| Well, part of it is having, where possible, having outdoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| I know when we have a picnic in our park that any time that we're doing that and being outdoors and visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:41| people are coming to see what's going on and what's going on in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| I think that also getting the word out through schools, sending flyers home with kids at schools where possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:56| Obviously, social media is one way to reach a part of the population, but it doesn't reach all the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4376)|
| 1:13:08| So it's got to be kind of a mixed mixture of ways for communication, whether it's flyers, whether it's phone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:18| whether it's going direct visits, whether it is the outdoor events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| And also the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| I'm very supportive of the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| They're doing a great job with getting that information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| and also helping form new organizations or neighborhood associations where there are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:40| Thanks, Jen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4427)|
| 1:14:18| Good evening, Ms. Parr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| I'll be asking your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| If you need me to repeat a question, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| District representatives on city council are often expected to be advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| Advocacy is a role that I take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| I believe that advocacy is probably the main thing that we need to do on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:46| Why I advocate is because there is a dire need for people's voices to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| Part of advocacy is going and listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| And being intentional about listening means that you go to where the people are least heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4496)|
| 1:15:02| On city council, I know that there are a lot of issues that come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| and there are a lot of the same voices that you hear that come into this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| But where are the voices that are least likely to come in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| and how do we go and find out what the needs are within the communities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| My role in this community, particularly District 1 and throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| is finding out what the needs are and how we can best do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| I take the time to go and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| I also go where the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| I go to court with individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| I will go to doctor's office with individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I will find out what the needs are through assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| and prioritize those needs and show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| Advocacy also is part of what we do broadly throughout our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:56| It's finding out what the issues are that are not just with the folks that I keep talking about, the marginalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| It's what are the issues that we have around community involvement and community engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| and how are we making sure that everybody is involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| So that means that I will have to listen to a lot of things that don't necessarily fit into the wheelhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| that I'm used to or that I work with primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| and I know that that's an important role that I will have to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| is to hear everybody with an open mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| and understand that it's not just one community that I need to be advocating for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| that everybody's voice is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| Listening is the biggest part of being an advocate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| knowing what people care about and then presenting your voice for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| Council Member Welch announced her intent to resign on December 9, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| District representatives on City Council are expected to be accessible and responsive to their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| as well as to the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| Please detail ways you personally have reached out to or made yourself available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| for District 1 residents and neighborhood associations since Council Member Welch's announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| At this point, I've been very busy advocating being available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| and present for the community that I work mostly with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| and that is primarily our homeless population as well as the Montgomery Village area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| I do need to go and be more present at some of our other organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| but I have talked with some of the organization representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| I will need to make myself more available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| That means attending the monthly meetings that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| and understanding what some of the issues are that are presented and being available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| Since she announced that, I've been very busy listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| and hearing what our folks on the streets are dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| and how we are being available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| The other thing that we look at when we're looking at some of the issues and concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| is how are we talking with city representatives as well as county representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| so that we cannot just be listening but looking to having movement around those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| I feel that it's very important for me to take a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| and invest in some of the other community issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| I am very familiar with some of the advancements that we've had in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| and been a part of some of those changes myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| but I do feel strongly that I do want to take a focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| in making sure that we're bringing everybody along in the listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| Renters represent the majority of our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| yet our neighborhood organizations are comprised primarily of homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| In your role as a member of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| how would you work to ensure the voices and priorities of District 1 residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| who are renters or houseless are reflected in the policies and spending priorities of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| I definitely will want to make sure that we're paying attention to the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| In our South Knoxville, we are losing a lot of the rental homes available to folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:10| who traditionally have been able to afford homes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| and there's kind of a push out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| I believe that probably the best way is to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| I was speaking with a friend outside about being more intentional about being present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| by doing door knocking, doing leaflet, and talking about the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| so that those who are not necessarily attending the organization meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| understand that their voice is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| and how are we going to make sure that their voices are heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4776)|
| 1:19:39| It has to be through intentionality and actual footwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| and making sure that people recognize that their voice matters in these decisions that are being made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| I think that it's going to have to take a lot more than just one woman doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| I think that our community organizations need to be as helpful about that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| and break out of the small clusters that they represent through homeownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| and see how they can include the rest of their community with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| So I would like to work closely with our community organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| the neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| and figure out ways that we can all be more intentional about including everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:17| So inclusivity is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| and ways that we can maybe move some of the curve that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| of making sure everybody is involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| As a council member, we are called on to represent varied viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| that may not be in line with our own personal viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| Give an example where you have been collaborative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| in solving a problem with people who have opposing viewpoints from yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| One of the things that I've been very focused on is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| how are we changing some of the stigma issues that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| And some of that is being about inviting folks to the events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| and different things that we have put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| so that we're making sure that everybody comes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| and is able to be part of the bigger picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| I know that for us at Next Step Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| and that's the organization I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| which is really more about representing a particular group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| we need to be very intentional as we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4879)|
| 1:21:23| and talk with the store owners and different folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| and help them to understand what some of the issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:32| and how can we bend some of the curve around some of the stigma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Now, that's going to take a lot of time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| and people's parts to come together and have listening sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| and making sure that everybody is present for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| I know that with our community, Bessel Community Organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| we've had some issues around people wondering about our homeless population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| but how are we all working together to solve those issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| I think it's important that we come together about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Since diversity is a valuable thing on City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| please share with us what perspective or experience you possess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| that is not already represented on this current council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| What I bring is a unique voice of representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| for a community that is least represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| And I know that we have a lot of folks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| who have a heart and a care and compassion about the issues that we face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| but I bring a completely unique voice of engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| that comes from being present for people that do not have that voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| And I've repeated that over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| But that's the unique position I bring to this City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| is that I am there understanding, educating myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| and being present for people who do not have representation here already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:59| Land use in the city is an important issue and a limited commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:04| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| Uses can be both conflicting and competing with a great deal of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| How will you approach difficult zoning decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4994)|
| 1:23:18| One of the things that we have, particularly in our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| is a lot of unused spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| Some of them are dilapidated and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| And there are issues around how do we use some of those spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| in a more positive way within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| And there are a lot of issues around zoning that don't allow for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| or ownership that don't give that space opportunity to be used in the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| I think that if we can work together through the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| some of the spending that we're doing and some of the intentions that we're doing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| as well as making sure that the communities that are surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| are on board with the decision-making that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5039)|
| 1:24:03| that we may be able to have a little bit more leeway and movement in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| It's a difficult process because you have people coming from many different perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| of what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| A lot of folks do not want to see the changes come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| or the people who have ownership over some of the spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| are not able to let up wanting to let go of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| In terms of some of the zoning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| everybody has a different perspective of what they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| and what they want within their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| So that's going to be a challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| and I already feel that challenge running in the race in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| We saw a lot of different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| So I think that we're just going to have to keep moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| How does public safety rank on your list of priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| What are your opinions on the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| What should change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| What should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| I believe that we need to have a lot more time of actual listening within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:10| I work very closely with our police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| in terms of what we're doing around some of the issues around poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| and engaging in conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| I do believe that we need to look at what the policies and procedures are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| and how are they being implemented on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| What are the trainings going on within our police force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| And how are we, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| enforcing that those trainings are geared towards making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:39| that we're educating our police force around some of the issues of trauma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5139)|
| 1:25:44| and how we're engaging with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| A quick example is in the Montgomery Village community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:53| I know that they do a lot of policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| but they're not doing community engagement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| I know there are restrictions in terms of the amount of police force we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| but while they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| are they making sure that they're engaging with the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| in a way that is more communicative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| where they're actually reaching out and saying hello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| and being more positive in some of the engagement that they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:23| Right now, it's about policing for crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| as opposed to making sure that everybody is learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| that the police are supposed to be there for your safety and protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| and not just for criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| And we're not doing that in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Knoxville has the same serious issues as the rest of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| homelessness, poverty, low wages, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| What is your role in addressing these topics on a city level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| On a city level, I'm actively engaged continually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| with the different departments to see what we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| not just around the conversation about the resourcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5217)|
| 1:27:00| and what are we doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| One of the things that I have to consider is how we're spending our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| and what are we spending our money on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| and not so much what we're spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| but the amounts of money that we're spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| If we're putting a large line item up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| that goes towards parks and recreation, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| and we have a smaller line item here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| that is meant to serve the needs of a vast amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| that is a much smaller amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| how is that going to be serving the community as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| If the families that are there in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| are not engaging in the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| because they're too busy living in a chaotic lifestyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| because we're not paying attention to the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| and the services that need to be available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| then we're doing a disservice to our city and our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| So I think that it's very important, so important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| that we engage with one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| and that we pay attention to what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| And do we need more trails?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Do we need more parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| Or do we need to look and put our investments into helping people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| to maintain a healthy lifestyle or even to obtain a healthy lifestyle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| Housing is an issue that we're not going to be able to solve overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| but as we stand right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| only those with the ability to have some sort of resiliency or supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:28| are able to get and obtain the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Right now we have a large, vast amount of people who are not being served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| and we're not paying attention to how we could better invest our dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| into making sure that everybody is served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| As a member of City Council, what role do you believe you should play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| in helping our city achieve racial equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| and address lingering historic disparities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| that have resulted in a 42% poverty rate in our black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| Oh, we've been so invested in reaching out to some of our neighbor communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| who are suffering some of the same issues that we are in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| The issues that we have in South Knoxville are more of a generational poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| from the Appalachian community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| but we do our outreach and engagement with a lot of folks in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| so that we know what the issues are and how can we come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5359)|
| 1:29:22| collaborate around those issues, get more people fed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| get more people into treatment, get more people served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:29| find out how we can better work together, community and community, community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| to serve the needs of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| My role definitely on City Council will be advocacy for those who are least heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5377)|
| 1:29:44| who are not necessarily there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| And in terms of our community, we work a lot with East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5387)|
| 1:29:52| and serving food and making sure it's distributed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| but also putting together events so that we're bringing resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5394)|
| 1:29:58| to those communities and sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| Collaboration is about people coming together and recognizing what the needs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| and how do you have this, we have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| how can we work together to improve all of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| I understand that the issues that are in all the different communities are varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| I've talked with different representatives about some of what the issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| within their own communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| But in terms of looking at what the issues are around poverty and inequities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:32| it's very similar when you're looking at the generational poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| that we suffer in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| as well as the issues that we have around policing in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| It's a lot of profiling, a lot of different things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| We need to come together and make solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| What are three steps you would take to ensure the future of our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| is on a firm financial footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:59| I think what we need to do is look at what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| We have a pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| It's what we're doing with that pot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| and the prioritization of the spending there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| So if we're investing our dollars, our time, and our energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| into things that do not incorporate all of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| So I sat two years ago in on the budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| I was sick for three weeks afterwards because it was really hard to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| what we were spending our money on and how we were spending our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| So if there's need for more money, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| that's something that we would need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| Where does that money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| How does that come about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| But the first thing I would do is look at how we're spending our dollars now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| and how is that reaching the broadest range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| The second thing I would want to do is listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| go out into the communities and find out what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| That's most important is knowing where your needs are not being met within a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:03| so that everybody is considered in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| I think the third thing I would do is look at ways that we're maybe engaging some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:16| with what goes on also in the county and city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| and seeing are we working the same together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| and is there anything that we can do to be more meeting of minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| around what is being spent, how it's being spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| and working together around those serving the whole of the body of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| That concludes my questions, but Council may have follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Rebecca, you've made really clear what so many needs in our community are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5566)|
| 1:32:53| and what you would like to spend some money on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| What are some of the things that you would be willing to cut out of the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| or percentage-wise how much would you want to put towards things that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| homelessness and affordable housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| What would you make the budget look more like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| I don't have a clear view of where your budget is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Once again, two years ago it was very hard to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| but I know that I was on the Board of CAC for six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| I know that they serve a lot of the needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| I know that the funding that goes into CAC, Community Action Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| it really was a small line when I know what all the services are that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:37| just to fill the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| I also know firsthand from conversation that only those who are eligible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5620)|
| 1:33:45| services are those, once again, who have the most resiliency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| and ability to be able to keep the funding sources going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| So we're not serving those who have the least amount of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| I felt very poorly and sore the fact that we put so much investment into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:06| Fort Dickerson for beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I go there regularly because I like to watch the sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| Nobody is utilizing that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| We've put a lot of dollars into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| There's a small park just down the way on Martin Mill that's dilapidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| It has all the playgrounds, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| There's not an investment there going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| That's where kids may be able to go to play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| or the other parks that are in our area where families might actually engage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5668)|
| 1:34:32| I also did not have a fond feeling about what happened with Sutchree's Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| That is not something that I felt like was the best investment for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| That investment was built for what was to come and what was to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| but how did it serve the community that already existed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| So I would look at what we're spending in terms of the supposed revenue that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| going to come out of some of the trails and some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| I'm not seeing that as a revenue thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I'm not seeing that as a way that we're actually increasing the value that's going back into our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| as much as the value of the people's lives, and that's where the value needs to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| I can't give you percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| I'd have to study the budget and look at it and see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| but I could see from that two years ago what that budget looked like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| that we were not prioritizing people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| How much of the budget do you think would need percent just general?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| I know that you haven't studied it lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| How much do you think would be needed to start really fixing some of these deep issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| that are generational and through discrimination and Jim Crow and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| Well, one of the things that we are not looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| and I don't know that city council would be able to have a whole lot of help around this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| is medical needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| If we're cutting funding for indigent care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| and that's the only care that people are allowed and able to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| then we have a whole group of people that are not going to get basic health needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| let alone mental health needs, let alone addiction services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5775)|
| 1:36:24| I would have had the line item be this big for CAC, knowing what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| because at this point they're getting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| which means they only can serve a certain amount of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| And at this point we're just throwing things at the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| and those who have the least amount of resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| as opposed to actually putting in improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| to bring those with the least amount of resources up the chain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| so that they can then move into a position where they become eligible for services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| I think it's important that we need to sit back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| take a bigger look at what we're doing with our dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| It's beautiful that we have a downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| I've been in Knoxville since 1980.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| I was here for the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| My first job was down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| It was great. It's lovely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| I love what we've done with our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| That's something that's going on across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Downtowns are becoming revitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| That's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| What happened when we did that, though, was that we then had a push-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| The folks who did have a space to live no longer have a space to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| What we're doing with folks who are living on the streets and the camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| how are we doing anything to help them other than keep shuffling them around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| putting them in prisons, and then it's a revolving door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| I know these aren't pretty issues to talk about, but I'm very honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| and I care about the things I'm speaking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| But if we keep at this pace, the disparity is going to keep growing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| and we're going to have a larger issue on our hand than we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| We've got the perfect storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| No medical care, no mental health care, an addiction issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| and the fact that the poor are having less and less ability to rise up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| I also would like to look at what are we doing to help people get into jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| Some of the reasons, federal funding has been cut a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| I think HUD, I can't remember the numbers, it went from $4 million to about $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| I might be completely wrong on those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| And then the state with the medical care not bringing in the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| not having the state institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| So the city is having to pick up where other agencies used to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5922)|
| 1:38:47| other funding used to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| So it ends up we have to start deciding what we're giving up in order to cover that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:55| So that's what I'm really curious with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| and I've been asking what do we get rid of in order to serve more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| Because there's always a loss involved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| I think I hit one, is that we look at what we're doing around putting our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| and investment into more parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Also, if we're looking at where we're spending our investment in terms of sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| Are we prioritizing where those sidewalks go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Are we making sure that it's going to the people who would then have access to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| perhaps food, perhaps a bus line, perhaps getting jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:39| Some of the investments that we're making are not geared to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:50| And it's kind of frustrating to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| I like arts programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| How are they serving the community as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| And are we putting those investments into ways to improve people's lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| So if we just have art for the sake of art, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| But how are we using some of the arts funding that we have to bring people to a greater place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:17| And I'm talking about programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| When I talk about programming, what I'm talking about there are bringing in education models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6019)|
| 1:40:26| bringing in hands-on experiences for people where we can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| and change the course of their life and their story and investments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:41| It's difficult for me to know, and I'd really have to look, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| at the budget to see where we would take away and what we would take away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| One of the things that also was something that I didn't care as much for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| and I don't see it as a long-term investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| is when we do a lot of just the façade improvements in our city in different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| how is that serving what goes on behind the façades in terms of investing in the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| that exist there already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| And a lot of that has happened with the Corridor of Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| If we're looking at spending money for entryways and things along those lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:20| so that we invest in the improvement of visibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| how is that going into the communities that exist there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| One last question, Ms. Farr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| If you were to become the successful candidate or not, this seat is going to be on the ballot in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| Would you seek to run for the seat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6103)|
| 1:41:47| I'm already in discussion with different folks in our community who are asking me if I will run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:54| Yes, I will be running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:35| Good evening, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:36| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6156)|
| 1:42:37| I'll be asking your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| If you would like me to repeat one, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| District representatives on city council are often expected to be advocates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| Specifically, what type of advocate will you be and why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:55| As I mentioned earlier in my opening speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| I've cared about the marginalized in our community my entire life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| and I do think that making that a priority and not just an afterthought will be at the core of my thought process for the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:17| I will be an advocate for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| The neighborhoods in our district particularly and other districts as well are the core fabric of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:30| As we think about development, I'll talk about this maybe in some other questions as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| but community out development, investment without displacement will be really important as we think about providing incentives for the corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:45| and different areas of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| And so I'm really keen to provide investment and incentives to different parts of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| but ensuring that it is of the community and for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| So that's the type of advocate I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| That's the lens with which I would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Land use issues are something that is a very common responsibility of this governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| and so particularly the first district is one of the first areas where the ring of development from downtown is growing into and near legacy neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:21| And so some of the tension there I think is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| And so things like vision plans that were created 15 and 20 years ago, development continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6265)|
| 1:44:33| And I think assessing those vision plans and being conscious of what we set out to do and what we're achieving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| one of the things I would recommend for any vision plan is that we have a five-year incremental look back to see how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:50| Development reaching legacy neighborhoods is another lens with which I would look through and advocate for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6298)|

| 1:45:24| Bless her because I've spent every evening away making myself accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| I've been to every neighborhood meeting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I've been to neighborhood meetings in other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| In fact, I've spoken with every neighborhood association leader in the community in some way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6335)|
| 1:45:43| I've listened well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| I got a little bit of a head start before December 9th in that I was on the Business Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| And while that's oriented for business people to provide feedback to the administration and Mayor O'Hara's administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:58| it also gives you a glimpse into the department at a real detailed level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| So I was able to get a heads up on the need for additional police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| I was able to understand our homelessness crisis even more than I already did because I was in that council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| Since December 9th, I've also reached out to each of you, made time to speak with each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:21| but also the residents that I've met with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| I've met with business owners on Chapman Highway and talked about the history of the businesses on that and what it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| I've talked to neighborhood advocates in other districts as well about different opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| whether it's Knoxville Center Mall or gateway access for trails from the Old City to Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6399)|
| 1:46:49| I've been attending as many neighborhood meetings as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| but also reaching out to as many individuals in the First District as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| I've had a lot of community leaders reach out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| I feel like I've tried to listen well and be responsible in how I listen to their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:10| Renters represent the majority of our city, yet our neighborhood organizations are comprised primarily of homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| In your role as a member of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| how would you work to ensure the voices and priorities of District 1 residents who are renters or houseless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| are reflected in the policies and spending priorities of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| Well, I mentioned earlier my dedication to helping people find homes has been something I've done from a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| My parents instill that concern in me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| I think our housing ecosystem is diverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| You look at rapid rehousing all the way to permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| We do have a diverse ecosystem of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:54| However, we need more capacity along that ecosystem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| I mentioned the Foyer and Southside flats in my opening remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| I'm also interested and optimistic, I should say, in the Austin Homes development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| The mixed income nature of that is something that looks like the community we all desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| where people that make different amounts of money can all live together, whether they rent or own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:17| That development, as I understand it, is going to have everything from market rate to significantly subsidized housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:25| Housing navigators are something that have worked in other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| and something I recommend that this administration and council consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| Essentially, it's where I need housing, and I walk into an office or representative from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| and they know the inventory of housing around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| Through HMIS and SWARPs, we track people who receive services through homeless agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| and so we know when they receive service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| But there's not a single point of contact where people know what the inventory is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| whether it's within Flinigan Landing, other KCD properties, or market rate low income rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6535)|
| 1:49:03| So I'm also optimistic about the five-year consolidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6543)|
| 1:49:09| I think there's a lot of detail in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| It's a shared issue among every district, so it couldn't be a higher priority for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| and I think it's probably the highest priority shared concern among all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| As a council member, we are called on to represent varied viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| that may not be in line with our own personal viewpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| Give an example where you have been collaborative in solving a problem with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| who have opposing viewpoints from yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| Well, for the past three months, I've been paying quite close attention to an issue that's in the first district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| and that's a development behind Sudtree Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| and so that's not something that I've stumbled onto in the past few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| I've met with each person involved in that, from the local school to the developer to the architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| and to the residents in that local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| We don't have a magical solution for you ahead of next Tuesday's council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6603)|
| 1:50:08| but I do understand the complexity associated with that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| We developed a vision plan 14 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| It's been 14 years, and this specific situation hasn't been foreseen until the development comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6614)|
| 1:50:23| There's not a process in the South Waterfront particularly like there is for the downtown review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| That downtown design review board is really helpful and has been really integral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| in making sure that developments downtown fit within the nature of the design of our town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6634)|
| 1:50:40| the future we want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| And so I would suggest that a similar process be used for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| It's a very unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| The complexity there among the neighborhoods and developer is really challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| and so for many hours and many nights I've listened to all sides of that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| and feel like I have a good understanding of the practical challenges and disagreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| but also the emotional ones that are built inside of what we think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| when we think about neighborhood and development and those things colliding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| When a community comes together around a vision plan, it's a beautiful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| My day job is creating strategic plans for businesses and nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| and that includes taking lots of different ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| and everybody agreeing on one piece of paper what the vision looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| So when a community does that, it's a wonderful thing and should be supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| So we need to take care of that, and I feel like we've probably been a little negligent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| in not honoring the beautiful aspect of that by following up with that vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6699)|
| 1:51:45| and making sure that we understand the ramifications of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| Since diversity is a valuable thing on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| please share with us what perspective or experience you possess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| that is not already represented on this current city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6715)|
| 1:52:02| Practically speaking, I've been in this community almost my whole life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| and I have a lot of relationships both in local government and local business and in nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6726)|
| 1:52:12| So as any city council person knows, it's responsible for a certain district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6732)|
| 1:52:17| A lot of the phone calls are, there's flooding here or there's traffic speeding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| Those practical things, I already have the relationships to take care of most of those things quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| I know who to call, and I know the basics of solving those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| In addition to that, I think the diversity in our community is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| Our kids go to public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| I'm a big proponent of public schools, mostly because it looks like our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| and so I think that's an extremely important thing for us all to care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| And while the city is not responsible for Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| we are responsible for everybody when they turn 18 that lives in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| And so hopefully we get a chance to talk about education and workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| But I think diversity in our schools leads to diversity in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| And so developing workforce programs, apprenticeships for that critical year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| when people graduate high school and may not choose college, that's such a critical point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| When you talk to folks at Emerald Youth Foundation, at Great Schools Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| similar organizations in Project Grad, that precious year after graduating high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6802)|
| 1:53:28| dictates probably the next five to ten years of somebody's life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| And so I've been a mentor as part of Tennessee Achieves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| I understand how critical that year is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| And I'm optimistic about apprenticeship programs that we can set up with businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6818)|
| 1:53:42| to ensure that there's a connection between education and career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| And I think those are some of the most fundamental ways we should think about diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| not just on council but in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| Land use in the city is an important issue and a limited commodity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| Neighborhood and commercial areas are both important and dependent on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| Uses can be both conflicting and competing with a great deal of contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| How would you approach difficult zoning decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:16| Well, I talked about the one on Langford in the first district at length a little bit already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:23| I think one of the things that is important, and I've already said this, but every vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6863)|
| 1:54:29| and I think about this for Western Avenue or the Broadway rapid transit corridor concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| or some other aspect, should have at a minimum a five-year assessment from the original vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:45| Fort Sanders is probably the first neighborhood that comes to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| where urban development around campus particularly has changed that neighborhood over multiple decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:58| And so understanding the intent of the code on a reoccurring basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:05| making sure that this intent of the vision plan and the code is reflective of what's possible there is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6905)|
| 1:55:16| And so one of the things I would suggest, particularly for the South Waterfront and other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| is that as part of these assessments of the vision plans and code reviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| we talk about what types of properties can be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| A lot of times what happens, for example, in this situation that we're referring to off of Langford is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| by the time the community gets their hands on it, it's kind of already cooked a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| in the sense that a property's been designed, there's been a lot of investment from the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| which shouldn't be minimized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| But at the same time, up front, these are the three, four, five, six concepts that could go into this code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:57| based on this code, I think is a function of government that probably could use some improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6957)|
| 1:56:04| Because layperson who's not an architect or designer or developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| maybe probably a lot of folks in this room, don't know what's possible next door to them based on complicated code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| And while we can't give a forecast for what's possible on every lot of land for specific districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| that are really unique like the South Waterfront, I think that it's important to do that on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:29| How does public safety rank on your list of priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| What are your opinions on the Knoxville Police Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| What should change? What should stay the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| Visiting every neighborhood in our city and listening to neighborhoods talk about crime or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:51| one of the things that is great is each neighborhood meeting kicks off with a police officer talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| what's going on in their community, and it's the same community police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| And so I think that's a wonderful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| Every neighborhood speaks highly of their local police officer that they know and work well with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| So that's working extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| At the same time, the shortage of police officers couldn't be more critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| Nearly every conversation in different neighborhoods somehow made its way to even neighbors know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7037)|
| 1:57:23| yeah, but they're short on police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| So it's interesting when there's a consistent theme among all neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| and that one consistent theme is, yeah, we're a little short on police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| or we're really short on police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| I think that means we're at kind of a crisis level, and it has all different kind of ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| Even the recruiter who needs to help recruit more police officers has to work a beat as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| So it's a little example of how stretched thin they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7069)|
| 1:57:53| In terms of community relations and how they work with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| I think those individual officers who are known by the community is a healthy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:03| I think the body cameras was a wise investment, and I think it makes the community feel safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| and it provides a level of transparency that each person in our community should feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7088)|
| 1:58:15| So if I could extend that to the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7095)|
| 1:58:18| I know that there are challenges associated with their recruiting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| Now, they're not at a crisis level, but they are seeing similar trends about being hard to recruit firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7102)|
| 1:58:29| So that's around the bend, and so I think that learning how to recruit community-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7109)|
| 1:58:37| and diverse candidates for police and firefighting is really critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7117)|
| 1:58:44| Knoxville has the same serious issues as the rest of the country, homelessness, poverty, low wages, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:51| What is your role in addressing these topics on a city level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| Well, I mentioned a couple of things already in this regard, but particularly related to housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7136)|
| 1:59:01| I think the rental rehab program, the down payment assistance, and weatherization support are fundamental to sustaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:10| the right amount of housing, guiding people towards permanent ownership, building equity in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7150)|
| 1:59:17| We all want to see the possibility for everyone to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| I mentioned the housing navigators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| I think that's a concept that we should pursue, and I do think models like the four-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:33| maybe even particularly in South Knoxville, being a low-barrier shelter with some type of programming associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7173)|
| 1:59:40| with finding permanent housing is a unique model and the type of model we should consider elsewhere if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:49| As a member of city council, what role do you believe you should play in helping our city achieve racial equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| and address lingering historic disparities that have resulted in a 42% poverty rate in our black community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7196)|
| 2:00:09| I would say this is a pretty broad statement, so it's a little dangerous sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| but I do say thinking of minority populations in our community, particularly African-American communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7213)|
| 2:00:20| has been overlooked and maybe not prioritized and definitely not prioritized enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7220)|
| 2:00:27| So elevating that as a first priority of any new development, any new incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:36| any new visioning for certain parts of town, for all parts of town for that matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| I think needs to be elevated to the appropriate priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| With that said, we all need shared services, and so transportation is something that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| Transit-oriented development is one of the best ways to ensure long-term residents stay in the community they want to stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7253)|
| 2:01:02| Transit-oriented development also prevents displacement in most situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:08| so to the extent we can leverage our bus transportation model, potentially light rail or other concepts that are transit-oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7268)|
| 2:01:17| is a good way to ensure that all of us receive similar access to similar services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7277)|
| 2:01:26| What three steps would you take to ensure the future of our city is on a firm financial footing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7286)|
| 2:01:40| Well, I'm familiar with the compression happening in our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7300)|
| 2:01:44| so whether the hall tax is being reduced or expenses in our administration or city government are exceeding revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7304)|
| 2:01:53| There are not a lot of ways to increase revenue in the city, as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| and I've learned over time increasing property taxes or revenue from new growth in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7319)|
| 2:02:09| So economic development would be the first way that I would achieve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7329)|
| 2:02:13| and while I don't have any magical answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| I do think there are opportunities for entrepreneurial hubs within different parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7336)|
| 2:02:24| I do think there are incentives we can give to local communities such as Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:31| and Vestal, et cetera, to make corners of different parts of that community thriving and lively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7351)|
| 2:02:40| So incentives for small business is something probably that we need to elevate as well in terms of priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7360)|
| 2:02:46| in addition to the investments we've made downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:51| Revitalizing downtown has been important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| It does provide resources, particularly for shared services across our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7373)|
| 2:02:59| So while that's important, it will take different incentives inside different community pockets to grow in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7379)|
| 2:03:07| and not just grow in the short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| We can't recruit a company and just pop them in the middle of a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| so we're going to have to get creative about how we incentivize growth in different corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| That's the conclusion of my questions, but Council may have follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| This pertains somewhat to question number nine about the poverty rate in the black community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| and then you just mentioned Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| Do you have a vision for what could possibly happen in Burlington as far as revitalizing that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7417)|
| 2:03:43| and providing housing and commercial interest there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7423)|
| 2:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| The East Tennessee Design Center has produced a vision plan for Burlington that I think is a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7432)|
| 2:04:00| The different communities I've lived in where a main street is the core of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7440)|
| 2:04:06| where there's retail on a main street but neighborhoods spring out from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7446)|
| 2:04:11| are one of the things I would seek to try to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| I think the East Tennessee Design Center plan for Burlington is a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| I don't have a magical answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7463)|
| 2:04:25| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7465)|
| 2:04:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| I'm sure you're familiar with the idea of institutionalized racism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7469)|
| 2:04:34| and it's more institutionalized anybody that has less economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:41| I think that's something that's gone on for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| and we've always carried on business as usual and haven't looked at those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| You know a lot about policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| Is that something that has popped out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| Is there anything policy-wise that we're doing that you see that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| I totally agree with you in the sense that there has been institutionalized racism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7500)|
| 2:05:07| in a lot of the different ways in our community particularly, nationally shared as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| I do think access to transportation, transportation refunds for job hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7513)|
| 2:05:23| I think one of the things that could help with that would be the American Jobs Center that's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7523)|
| 2:05:31| which is, I think, state-funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| I don't remember if it's federal or state-funded, but a Knoxville version of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| I have plenty of friends who would like to work, either recovering addict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7537)|
| 2:05:45| or recovering homeless, who would like to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| So I think a version of that, a city version of that, of I would like to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| which was something we all want to hear from anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7556)|
| 2:06:01| specific resources dedicated to workforce development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| and job placement in minority communities is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| I think it needs to be elevated to a first priority and not an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Mr. Smith, very briefly, as you know, this district seat will be on the ballot in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7580)|
| 2:06:27| Whether you're the successful candidate or not this evening, would you seek election in the 2021 election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7587)|
| 2:06:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| I think the person who serves this role, it's an extremely important role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| and I commend you all for spending the amount of time we're spending on it because it is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| The person who serves in this role should be accountable to the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| since those constituents don't get to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| Having someone who plans to run in two years, I think, is a way of holding them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| I also think that a year and a half or two years before that election is enough time to make people happy and mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7617)|
| 2:07:03| And so there are a bunch of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| There's equal opportunity for satisfaction and dissatisfaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| including some decisions coming up next Tuesday in the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7629)|
| 2:07:13| So I do think accountability is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=7633)|

| 2:16:03| Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8163)|
| 2:16:06| It's an ineligible vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| He was the last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8167)|
| 2:16:09| He received the fewest number of votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| Vote for Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8174)|
| 2:16:15| Where are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:16| The only candidate with the least amount of votes in that last round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| As a point of clarification, Mr. Hayes received three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| Mr. Smith received five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| The rules are the candidate with the least votes drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| Because Mr. Smith did not receive six votes in that round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| there must be a round where Mr. Smith receives six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| That was not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8203)|
| 2:16:45| We're going to another round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:48| We are in the middle of another round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265200220specialcalledpart2?start=8208)|
