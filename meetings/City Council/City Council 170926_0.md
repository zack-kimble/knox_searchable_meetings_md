| 0:01:48| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| All council members are present. Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=115)|
| 0:01:58| Any opposed? The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| Are there any items to be withdrawn? Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=121)|
| 0:02:06| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| Yes. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=128)|
| 0:02:10| Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=130)|
| 0:02:12| Item 12D has to do with the application related to the Midway Road change in zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=132)|
| 0:02:21| and we're asking that that be postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| We've all received a letter from Arthur Seymour representing the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| and they're working on efforts to comply with the Hillside Ridgetop Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| and so they need additional time for their engineers to wrap up their efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| So we're asking it be postponed until the next city council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| And there's no opposition to that, because I know of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| And do we have a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Okay. So the motion is to postpone 12D, dealing with the Midway Road rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| Are there any questions or discussion from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Any opposed? That has been postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Councilman De La Volpe, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| The consent items are 11N through S, pensions, and 12E through G, 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=209)|
| 0:03:32| The mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| First, I need to say some goodbyes and also give some congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| The goodbyes are sad ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| As most of you know, Christy Branscom, my chief operating officer and deputy to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| is leaving us at the end of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| She's returning to the private sector and to her family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| Businesses, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Christy, as you all know, has been with us for five and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| first as the senior director of public works and then as COO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| I don't think I have to tell you all how invaluable her leadership has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| She has overseen major projects like the new public works service center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| and all of our work at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| You understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| She negotiated the deal to bring Regal's headquarters to the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| She has professionalized and modernized city services across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| and made them more efficient at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=271)|
| 0:04:34| leading to a savings of more than $13 million in operating expenses in the past five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| She has been a vital resource and an advisor for me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Her private sector experience has given us important perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=285)|
| 0:04:48| and insights into our economic development efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| I've always said I've been fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| I had a public policy, public process person as a deputy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| and then I had a private sector business person in operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| Just the perfect team, perfect match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=305)|
| 0:05:08| So we will all miss her very terribly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| and I know council will join with me in thanking Christy for a job extremely well done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| and wishing her much success, whatever she decides to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=322)|
| 0:05:35| I think she can come to public forum now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| Yeah, just she waits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Christy, you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| It's been a bittersweet time in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| working at the city of Knoxville has been an incredible experience. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| enjoyed it so much. Like everything, some days were more pleasurable than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| others. But, um, you know, it's I just think it was an amazing opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| for me at the right time of my life. And I so appreciate the, um, working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| with all of the staff here. That's what I tell everyone. That's what makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| this job so special. That's gonna be the hardest part. Dwayne asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| earlier. Have you had some tough goodbyes? Or maybe it was been barred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Think talking in my staff meeting was the hardest part because those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| that I work with every day and I'm really going to miss them. But that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=380)|
| 0:06:24| what's made this job so wonderful is working with the people and doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| kind of things that you get to do in public service and helping people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| our community. And I'm really gonna miss that. But it's just an amazing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| experience for me. And I really want to say thank you. All of City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| learned from all of you enjoyed working with you as well. And I'm sure I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| see you around and call me. We'll go to lunch. Thank you. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| Christy. So the second goodbye is to Joe Walsh. Joe, why don't you come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| to the podium there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Our parks and recreation director who is retiring next week. So Joe has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| with the city a total of 30 years, and he's been with parks and rec for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| last 25. He's seen a lot of changes and helped make a lot of change in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| time. Public expectations of our parks and recreational opportunities have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| grown considerably, and we offer facilities and programs now that nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| had even heard of 25 years ago. Whether it's greenways, skate parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| universal playgrounds or pickleball, Joe has always been enthusiastic about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| embracing new ideas and responding to community needs. Most recently, Joe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| oversaw the relocation of his entire department from downtown to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| administration building at Lakeshore Park. It's really a perfect home for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| department. How many of us get to say I went to the park to go to work every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| day, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| So, Joe, thank you so much for all of your work. I know everyone here wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| you a great retirement, whatever you decide to do next in your life as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| And we appreciate so much. I know as mayor, having you as our director during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| my five and a half years, I want to thank you for everything that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| done for this administration and for all the administrations before it. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=496)|
| 0:08:29| Real briefly, I've had the mayor and I argue about this sometimes as who has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| the perfect job. I think I've got the perfect job, and I'm pretty blessed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| be where I am serving the public. It's been. It's been a great 25 years in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| recreation. I just want to thank this council and this mayor and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| previous council and all the previous mayors, because a lot of cities that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| work with across Tennessee and across the United States are not as fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| as Knoxville is as far as the investment and the concern they have for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=534)|
| 0:08:58| parks and Recreation Department as a vital service that the city provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| And I know over the years we've been well funded and appreciate your support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=542)|
| 0:09:07| over the years and looking forward to maybe coming back sometime as a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| citizen and speaking of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| Yeah, you and Christie both. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| of course. So with these departures, we have vacancies, and that's where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=558)|

| 0:09:58| closely with Christie and me and many of our department heads, and he has a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| of great ideas, a lot of energy and a real passion for this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| You know, if we have to lose Christie, then it's great to have somebody like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| David, who is there in a position, willing and able and talented enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=612)|

| 0:11:11| their job so she can do a better job as as, um, at that time, the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| service deputy. I mean, public service deputy director. So I know she's excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| about now taking over the role from Joe. Big shoes to fill. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| Cheryl's really prepared and will do a great job in as our new parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=686)|
| 0:11:32| recreation director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=692)|
| 0:11:34| Also, along with those promotions, there's three others I want to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Chip Berry. Stand up, Chip. Chip has been Christie's right arm and left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| arm over these last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| 5.5 years, basically. And so we have now named him deputy chief of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| operations. He will report directly to David. He is going to directly. He's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| gonna have some director reports, which he hasn't had in the past. But also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| he's sort of the guy that that David will go to will all go to when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| things that need to be done overall with operations. So I already was glad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| to delegate a few things today to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| that he hadn't already delegated prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you, Chip. Rachel Butzler will replace Cheryl Ely is deputy director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| of public service. Rachel has done a really great job as our solid waste| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| manager, leading us through the overhaul of that contract and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| rollout of their new collection system. As you all know, that was a, um, tough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| job, really tough job, but she handled it very well, and she will do a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| job as deputy director of public service. Nick Bradshaw. He has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| serving as interim deputy director of our fleet division. He will now move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| into that position on a permanent basis again. The very talented staff person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| who has proven himself in the short time he's been in that role, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| want to make it permanent. So although it's sad to lose these great people, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| is good to have so many talent, talented folks who can move up to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| positions. I've been working hard to be prepared for that. So congratulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| Few more things to mention. National night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| yeah, I would just like to thank Christie for being so strong. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| easy. I'm sure having nine council members pulling at you, but she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| certainly has a knack for being able to tell, you know, in a very diplomatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| way and explain explain herself along the way. We teach people how does they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| know the council? I don't know. It doesn't always happen, but she she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| just she's done a fantastic job, and I know we all miss her. And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| future councils and what have you won't have her wisdom there at at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| fingertips. And Joe, I'm surprised he answers the phone when he sees when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| call, but he's been so instrumental. And that was a recording to the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=842)|
| 0:14:09| eight years, and particularly his guidance and leadership in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| advancement of the urban wilderness. A lot of it couldn't have taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| without Joe and his team and in their efforts, and he'll certainly be missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| I've known Joe long time. We graduated high school together and been friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| and has done an outstanding job. But I can't say enough about how happy I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| for David. I've never seen anybody be so when you call him and ask him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| something, be so positive all the time and can't wait to help. So you've made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| wise choice to put him there. And just an example, I was out driving around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| district in a week ago, Sunday, and I noticed that they had the back entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| closed at Fort Dickerson. So I'm just curious more than anything else. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| sent an email to Joe and he explained to me during, you know, it's past season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| We don't have supervision, so they lock it up and what have you. Of course, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| then David weighs in and said, well, Councilman, do we need to meet? And I'm like, oh, probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| I mean, I don't have a whole lot of time left here. I'm sure the next person will, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| know, may have a question. But it was the answer. But it's just that enthusiasm is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=920)|
| 0:15:25| what really makes the city work, because it is a service organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| But not, you know, just because it's a service organization doesn't mean it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| to be addressed with such enthusiasm and openness. So we'll miss them and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| thank you so much. Thank you. Vice Mayor Grieve. Thank you, Mayor. I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| repeat the things that Councilman Pavlis did on David, but, you know, I echo those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| same things. I've never had a telephone call that isn't either answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| immediately or that there's that enthusiastic David on the other side. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| also, I want to personally thank Joe and Christy. I really want to thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| all the work that you all have done on Lakeshore. That's been, of course, real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| special to my district. And it's obvious it is where it is because of you two. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| then, Joe, also all the work that you've done out at West Hills, us trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| a parking lot in and the pickle courts and that sort of thing. So I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| thank both of you. And both of you will be missed. And I've really enjoyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| working with both of you. Thank you so much for all you've done and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| service to the city. Appreciate it very much. Thank you. Thank you. I know Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| realizes that not only these folks we've recognized tonight, but many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| their colleagues. They truly are. With cell phones today, they truly respond 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| 7. Sometimes when something comes to my mind, it's late at night and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| send an email. I learned that when I send an email that people would respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| immediately. You know, it might be pretty late. So now I start, and if I really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| a response, that's fine. But often I'll say, for Monday morning or for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| Like, don't feel like you have to figure out this answer right away because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| that's how they are. They immediately respond when there's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| goes out. So, so we're very fortunate, I think, here at the city. So now we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| move on. Um, few other things I need to mention. National night out is coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| next Tuesday, October 3rd. Council members know this is an annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| nationwide event to raise awareness about safety issues and to strengthen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| the bonds between the community and the police. The Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| and neighborhood groups celebrate national night out on the first Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| of October and all over town. Neighborhoods will be having cookouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| and potluck suppers, ice cream, socials and other events so that neighbors can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| get to know one another better and strengthen relationships with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| individual police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Uh, so it's not too late for your neighborhood to participate. Just call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| Officer John Morgan at 2151519 to register if you've not already done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| that. And this will ensure that KPD attends your event as well. You want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| add anything about that? Chief? It's always a fun night. Uh, and of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| I'll counsel and and I know you'll be out there. Um, and it's just a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| opportunity to get out with our community and interact with with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| who help us do what we do and keeping the community safe. We also I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| know if you have it, Mayor, about the coffee with a cop. No, it's not on my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| list. So, uh, national coffee with a cop is on 10 for, uh, on, uh, October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1105)|
| 0:18:33| 4th. And we will be having, uh, one here in Knoxville at the Chick fil A in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1113)|

| 0:19:43| Finally, with all of the other recognitions were giving tonight, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| also want to mention two more organizations and their leaders. Visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| Knoxville and SMG are two of our most valuable partners, as you all know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1190)|
| 0:19:55| helping to promote Knoxville as a destination for tourist conventions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| events of all kinds. Visit Knoxville has been doing just phenomenal work, truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| phenomenal, building us into more and more of a tourism market. Not long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| our tourism efforts mostly focused on things we were close to, like stop by on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| your way to the Great Smoky Mountains, right? Um, Visit Knoxville has made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Knoxville itself their focus, and it is really paying off. SMG, with Mary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Bogert here and some of her team, manages the Convention Center and, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| y'all know, the old, um, Convention Center, the KCEC. What do we call that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| Guild Exhibition Center? Whatever that's called. KCEC, under Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| And last year, we also added the Auditorium and Coliseum and Chilhowee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| Park to their portfolio. Uh, and if you've been to those facilities since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| they took over, I know you can see the difference. And if you've read this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| wonderful summary that Mary Bogert sent to you, if you haven't read it yet, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| would have gotten it in your email. Do so. It is very, very impressive. So I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| wanted to ask Kim Bumpus, President of Visit Knoxville, and Mary Bogert, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| General Manager for SMG Knoxville, to just give us some brief reports on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| recent successes and what's coming up. Thank you, Mayor. I'm Kim Bumpus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| President of Visit Knoxville. For those that don't know, we're on 301 South Gay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| Street. It's the corner of Summit and Gay with the big mural on the side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| the building. Before I get started, I did definitely want to say thank you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| everyone in this room and a special shout out to Christy and Joe. I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| know he was gonna be here being celebrated also, but they've both been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| really instrumental to Visit Knoxville and I just appreciate you. So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| And then congrats, David. We were already used to bossing him around, so it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| work out for us. But with that, tourism is a team business and honestly, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| appreciate all the nice words about Visit Knoxville, but we wouldn't be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| doing what we do if it wasn't for all of you and everyone in this room and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| especially Mary and her team. And some of them are in the audience. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| gonna perform at the end. So Visit Knoxville, we're five years old this year. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| that's kind of crazy, but it is. November 1st is our five-year anniversary, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| we're very excited. I hope you got to save the date. We'll be doing a kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1331)|
| 0:22:15| big rollout on November the 3rd, which is First Friday, and we'll be celebrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| everything we've done in the past five years. And it's quite amazing and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| also coming off of an extremely exciting fiscal year. So I'm just gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| throw out a few stats at you, and I know Mary's got some things she wants to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| so I won't take long. But we are on our third year of amazing hotel motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| collection. We've been averaging 9 to 11 percent ahead of the year prior, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| that's huge. I mean, we're outpacing a lot of our competitive set in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| there. We're also on our second year of producing over a billion dollars in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| visitor spending, and that is tracked by the state. That's not economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| That's a real number based on employment numbers, state and local taxes, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| very exciting. We also just closed the year by booking over 132 events as Visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1380)|
| 0:23:06| Knoxville in partnership a lot with the convention center, but 68 percent of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| was new business. And that's really what's the most exciting, not to mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1391)|
| 0:23:15| 30 of those are at the Knoxville Convention Center. But 68 percent new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| business means that we are truly at our momentum. I mean, people are searching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| Knoxville, and I know I've been here for the last 20 years in tourism, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| just a very amazing thing to see. We're finally on the map as a premier getaway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| destination, and that's why we're seeing this amazing growth. On average, just so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| you kind of know Visit Knoxville, we're booking 130 events in the year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| future years, while partnering and servicing over 270 events in the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| for the year. And that's extremely important also because that speaks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| our visitor experience and makes sure we're delivering on every aspect, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| repeat business is always something we have to fight for. We have destinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| knocking on our door, wanting some of our big citywides that come to town, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| we have to kind of fight them off, and we always have to be at our excellent best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| Some other things we did in this past fiscal that are exciting and make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| competitive edge for Knoxville is we invested in sport court. We now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| enough basketball, volleyball court to do 10 basketball courts and 14 volleyball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| courts in the Convention Center, and it's also a special shout out to the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| of the funding for KCEC, because that's just going to open up these tournaments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| that we can do while still booking association business in the big facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| And we're working on one tournament that we just stole from Chattanooga based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| our rolling billboard of tractor-trailer trucks that we sent down there to go get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| this tournament, and we need both facilities. We're even bringing in more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| sport court than we own to host this particular tournament, so it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| be amazing and it's going to be things that Knoxville's never seen before. A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| couple of other things that we rolled out is the BK housing system. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| that's a real shout out to what we're doing at Visit Knoxville in trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| grow private revenue in addition to the support we get from the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| and hotel motel tax. So housing is a way to quantify groups while still recouping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| some of the investments we're putting back into the groups, and I'm really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| excited to say that as Visit Knoxville, through some of our sports partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| and our housing agency, we've grown our private revenue stream to go back into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| the mission by 68%. So we're right, we're knocking on a million dollar door, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| that's huge because all of our competitive set are membership bureaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| So Chattanooga, for instance, is getting a million dollars just through its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| members, and we don't want to do that in Knoxville because it tells kind of an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| antiquated story of your destination, especially for those partners that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| have the money to be a member. So we do that through our sports partnerships and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| our marketing partnerships, and so that's a very exciting thing, something to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| watching for the future. I could go on and on, but I won't because I can feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Mary tapping her foot behind me. So with that, we're also really active on Ollie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| and the bike share, and there'll be some exciting updates coming out about both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| of those initiatives very soon, and with that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Hey Kim, Kim, would you... I know we had a report, a written report from Mary. Could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| you put some of this in an email to us perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| Definitely, and right in front of you, I've laid out your... sorry Mary's mad about this too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| because I brought handouts, but you have your annual report and your road map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you for reminding me of that, Mayor. I should have pointed that out. That has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| 90% of the data that I just spilled out to you, and I don't know if everyone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| getting them, but we also send out an email update like Mary's as it relates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| to the quarterlies, and you can always find any of the documents in your hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| on our website under the media page of the website. Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you. Mary. Mary Bogert, 701 Henley Street, Knoxville, Tennessee. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1614)|
| 0:27:02| reiterate a little bit of what Christy said. It's been a real pleasure to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| with Christy, and I'm looking forward to working with David, and even more so with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Chip. We work very closely together, but it's been a real pleasure. I've learned a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| lot from you and hate to see you go. Good luck in the private sector. Anyway, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| to take a minute, you know, I sent all you an update. It was very, very long and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| very lengthy, but for those of you in the room who didn't get that update, I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| want to go over a few of the highlights. There are several members from my team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| here tonight. I have Mitch List, who's our AGM at the Knoxville Civic Auditorium and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Coliseum, and then Kate Jackson, who's Director of Event Services at the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Convention Center. The rest of the team could not be here this evening. Greg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| McKay is doing his Tennessee Promise meeting tonight, and then the rest of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| team at the Convention Center are feeding 1,200 people, so they hate they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| couldn't be here, but I certainly will take your nice comments back to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| because it really does mean a lot to them to know that you appreciate their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| hard work. There have been several milestones, though, that I do want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| point out because it's been a really incredible year of transition. Milestones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| for SMG Knoxville and for your venues. The staff here are very, very proud of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| those accomplishments, and so I'll rattle off just a few phone numbers and facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| too. I do want to say, and where's Jim York? Why is he never here when we be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| behind you? Okay, Jim York's here. Well, we beat budget at all three facilities, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1700)|
| 0:28:29| we're proud to have done that. Collectively, by $257,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| so we're glad to be able to give that back to the City of Knoxville. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| booked 800 and, well, we had 877,504 attendees at the booked and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1716)|
| 0:28:44| ticketed events. We booked 393 events for a total of 1,134 event days. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| pretty busy for the venues. The good news is we see bookings continue to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| at all of the facilities, and I will give a shout-out to Mitch and the fine job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| that he's done at KCAC. We are up 50% at the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| touring concert bookings, so that is pretty incredible, and a huge shout-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| to Mitch and his team for that. We also beat our disadvantaged businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| goal for the year with all three facilities, so we're really proud about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| that. A few other things that I want to let you know because you all are key. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| City of Knoxville administration, the mayor, and you all have been so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| incredibly supportive of everything we've asked you to do for us, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1769)|
| 0:29:34| keeps us from being status quo. It keeps us trending and marketable, and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| attendees notice that. Our meeting planners, our concert promoters, they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| that, and it keeps them coming back to Knoxville. A few things that I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| let you know that are a little bit new and rolling out. At the Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Center, we added valet parking this year. We're soon to open a self-service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| business center, and in partnership with Visit Knoxville, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| really important to point out that we were able to offer free Wi-Fi to all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1801)|
| 0:30:07| attendees at the Convention Center this year, and that is huge when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| selling a building to a meeting planner and a group of attendees. At the KCAC, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| new fly rail and auditorium that you all approved, it's making that our stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| house marketable to tours that come through the auditorium, so thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| much for that. We also have been upgrading the hockey experience. We added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| VIP hockey boxes last year. We continue to upgrade those, and this year you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| going to see cocktail service, enhanced beverages, and menus offered at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| hockey games. Another thing that we're about to announce is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| have just added a lactation room at the Civic Auditorium, and that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| possible by a grant that we received from the Knox County Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| so you'll be hearing about that coming up. At Chihuly Park, the mural has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1858)|
| 0:31:04| huge, huge hit. We'd like to bring more public art to the park, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| upgraded the midway tunnel entrance and all the landscaping throughout the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| If you drive through there, you'll notice that the team's really been working hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| at that. Then also, another shout out to Visit Knoxville. In partnership with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| we rebranded Chihuly Park with a brand new logo, a new website, and a new event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| guide. If you haven't been paying attention, we've been doing quite a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| concerts at Chihuly Park. We had one on Saturday evening, and it's really due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| the fact that those tools are readily available to concert promoters, so lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| of exciting things are happening. Lastly, I'd like to say that our team was so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| incredibly excited to have been recognized by the Knoxville Chamber this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| last year as a finalist at the Pinnacle Awards for excellent service and growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| in the medium-sized business category, so that was a real shout out to us, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| appreciate it. So really, just in closing, again, thank you all for all that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| done. I'll probably see you again on October the 10th. I have a few more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| things to bring before you, but because of everything that you do, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| administration, Christy Branscombe, I mean, we've been able to hit tourism and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1930)|

| 0:32:58| in favor say aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it, and so ordered. 9B is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| ordinance to amend Chapter 20, Article 3, Sections 20-52, 20-54, 20-55, 20-56, 20-57,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=1984)|

| 0:33:20| and adding Sections 20-64 and 20-65 as new sections of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| to augment and clarify existing ordinances, codify certain regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| that are now in place, and to remove language that is no longer necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| Vice Mayor Gray. Thank you, Mayor. I just had a question for clarification in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| terms of guns in the park. What is our situation with that now? In the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| ordinance, it talks about no person in public parks shall use or carry firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| Is that except as authorized? Except as authorized by law, and we adhere to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| state law with regard to guns in the park. Thank you. Thank you. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| questions? So we have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2048)|
| 0:34:15| The ayes have it, and so ordered. 9C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| Code Appendix B, Zoning Regulations, to update the City of Knoxville Parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| Councilman Delamonti. Is Ms. Cuccaro here? She is not here. Ah, then you're here. But I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| Yeah, you guys sent out a memo last night making some changes, improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| slash, and we need to go over a few of those to make sure we understand them. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| don't know if you've seen it or not. It was about 5 p.m. last night. All of you should have received the memo. It's mostly, simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2090)|
| 0:35:00| rearranging the, as Councilman Saunders said, rearranging the chairs on the deck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| and whatnot so that it is organized so that the ordinance is organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| appropriately. If you see, really the essence of it is that in that final page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| where she suggests five changes to the ordinance as it currently exists, and one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2121)|
| 0:35:32| three, and four are all simply rearranging the code so that it fits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| together appropriately. If you look at number two, it's adding a new section C3D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| which would provide that non-residential uses in residential or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| agricultural zoning districts be 10 feet, and then the last one would be amend the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| perimeter screening area in C.8 subsection 1 to 10 feet instead of 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| feet. So those are the, those are the changes, the proposed amendments that she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| would request that you make. I think she's gone over there with Peter Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| I think Peter is here somewhere. He may need to add some clarification to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Peter, do you want to? One of the questions is why did we change from from 15 feet to 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| feet in that C.8.1 that's now being relocated? I guess I'm not sure I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| understand exactly why we're doing that. It would be nice to know. Hi, Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| Director of Plans Review and Inspections. That was, it wasn't addressed during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| first reading two weeks ago. We got together with Casey Krause to, the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| there is to have setbacks and screening. We want to protect the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| residential neighbors. Right, but you're shrinking the setback, right? The setback was...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| It was 15 feet, now it's going to 10. Well, it was a perimeter screening of 15, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| the actual landscape requirements aren't changing. You're still having the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| amount of screening. In terms of plant matter? Pardon me? In terms of the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| plant matter? Yes. We looked at it, we saw that it was consistent with other, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2240)|
| 0:37:28| with multi-dwelling structures and developments abutting residential, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| it's a higher impact adjacent to a residential property in a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2252)|
| 0:37:38| zone. So we were looking for some level of consistency there. And then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| question that occurs is, we had that whole debate the last time we talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| about this, about the things that were in the screening landscaping world that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| also had a flavor of a setback requirement that might require public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| notice and opportunity to be heard. And we're doing some of that, I think. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| doing the... The C-7 is moving over, I think. And then there's the items that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| were C-8, 1, 2, and 3. And how are you addressing that, I guess? Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2292)|
| 0:38:21| being, you know, perimeters... Well, it's written perimeter screening, but it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| to do with between the parking lot and an adjacent residential zone is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| Between a parking lot and an adjoining right-of-way or street is two. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| between a parking lot and any property zoned for mixed or non-residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2317)|
| 0:38:44| Those were the three categories. We wanted to make sure that they fell into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2324)|
| 0:38:49| the setback world. And I think we're trying to do that here, but I just want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| to understand it a little better. We previously had setbacks for all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| except for the new addition. The 10-foot setback between a non-residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| and a residential district. Those items in C-8 have always been landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| requirements. Right. And so the goal here is to put them back in the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| section. J-section for landscaping. Yeah. And the amount of plant material is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| changing. The ability to screen is not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2364)|
| 0:39:32| Well, I guess the question is, have we covered all the bases with regard to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| amount of setback issues that are covered in the C subsection, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| is location and setback? Because I understand what you're saying. The parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| that are described as screening ought to be in J and landscaping. If you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| C-3, we already have setbacks established for industrial adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| residential or ag. The 20-feet guitar soil. Right. We've got the setbacks. They were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| always there. And so that's why we felt it was best to keep the landscaping as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| landscaping. We recognized the opportunity under the original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2407)|
| 0:40:15| for a non-residential use of church or school that wasn't specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| addressed. And that's the new D? That's the new D. That's 3D, right? Yes. And there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2420)|
| 0:40:28| again, the screening requirements are remaining the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| Did you get your question? I think from him, I understand that Ms. Malone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| something, but that may be coming up later. Okay. Vice Mayor Grave. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| Peter, on 8-1 that they're recommending the change in terms of screening, is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| are we talking about a parking lot next to a residential? Reducing it from 15 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| 10? C-8-1. Perimeter screening area in C-8-1 to 10 feet instead of 15. That last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2460)|
| 0:41:13| number 5. Yes. And there again, it's just the width of it. And there again, when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| talked with with Casey Krause, our urban forester, he went through this with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| as well, and he says 10 feet's appropriate for that level of plant material. Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| I'm not concerned about the screening or the amount of material, but all of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| sudden, what we've talked to people over this whole period of time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| especially some of my constituents, that what we're talking about is instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| what you're doing, instead of having 15 feet of asphalt or concrete, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| cutting it down to 10 feet. And I think that's a change that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| Isn't it? What are you actually talking about there? The dirt spot. I'm not sure I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| understand what your question is. We wanted to have the screening consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2522)|
| 0:42:07| We didn't want to have 15 foot of screening, which you definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2527)|
| 0:42:12| have to have within your setbacks from C-3, where we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2532)|
| 0:42:22| 10, 15, or 20 foot setbacks adjacent to a residential or agricultural zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| property. So you've got your level, based on what your zone is, adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| to residential. So you've got anywhere from 10 to 20 feet of setback. We didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| want a situation where, if you've got, for instance, a multi-dwelling structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| development that's adjacent to another residential property, C-3 says you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2569)|
| 0:43:00| need a 10 foot setback, but then you go to the landscaping and it says you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| to have 15 feet wide of landscaping. There's more landscaping than required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2585)|
| 0:43:11| setback, and that setback hasn't changed. So we're just providing a level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| consistency. So you're not changing the setback requirements? Not in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2596)|
| 0:43:22| situation. In any situation? Well, we've added the setback for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| non-residential use in a residential zone, and that's something that wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| specifically addressed. And what is that? What is it now? What we have proposed is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| 10 feet, which is consistent with multi-dwelling structures and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| developments. Okay, so commercial next to residential is what? Commercial next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| residential, that's going to be 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Industrial is 20. So you've got a 15 foot setback, and then 10 foot of that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| to be a landscape screen. You make no distinction between multi-dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| structures and just residential. That's the difference here, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| C3C talks about multi-dwelling adjacent to single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2653)|
| 0:44:21| residential being residential. Yeah, that's a residential use, and then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| didn't specifically identify the non-residential, the churches and schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| and such. But that's the same 10 feet is what you're saying? Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| Okay, recent changes to the proposed ordinances adopted by City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2677)|
| 0:44:45| Council have been reviewed by the City and MPC. MPC reviewed these changes also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| Yes, sir. Okay, I have a question for MPC. You speak into your mic. I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2689)|
| 0:44:57| question to MPC just as a review on the, or I guess we ought to stay with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| these first. I'm sorry. Pardon me? My question has to do with another part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| You want to stay with these five items? Might be good. Okay. Okay, are there, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2707)|
| 0:45:16| there any further discussion on these five proposed amendments from the Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Department? Councilman Del Vecchio? Yeah, if it's appropriate, or at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2719)|
| 0:45:28| permissible, I would ask Ms. Malone, who has spent a lot of time looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| if that explanation resolves some of the questions she has raised, since we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| staying on this subject matter before we move to any other parts of the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| ordinance, if that's okay, if she would address that set of changes, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| be helpful. So that we keep it all in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road. On behalf of Fountain City Town Hall, I just saw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| the Law Department memo this afternoon after talking with Councilman Del Vecchio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| and he mentioned it and sent it to me. Going through the five points, to answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| first of all, Councilman Del Vecchio's question, were all bases covered? My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| answer is, I would say no. Second of all, I'm not sure I understand everything Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2776)|
| 0:46:27| Ahrens was saying. I think there is confusion between setback, distances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2787)|
| 0:46:35| depths. Certainly a distance of 10 feet versus 15 is 33%, and we consider that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2795)|
| 0:46:44| significant. That's a setback versus a planting area, and I understand Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2804)|
| 0:46:53| Krause may have an opinion on the planting, the width of the planting area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| but that's different from the setback, and what we're trying to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| distinguish it. When we were here two weeks ago, it was clear that Mr. Green thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| the planting areas were setbacks, and I believe Mr. Ahrens thought that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| setbacks were in the setback and location, location and setback section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| and they weren't. So we basically had planting areas which are not setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| but Mr. Green had been speaking of them as setbacks. So you got some confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2843)|
| 0:47:30| going. I think the confusion continues. So to speak, and when I was here last two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2850)|
| 0:47:36| weeks ago, I made it very clear I was not asking for any dimensional changes, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| more screening, any less screening, any bigger depths or smaller depths. I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| simply trying to make sure we all understood what the ordinance said and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| that it could be enforced. So to respond specifically to the five points in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| yesterday's memo, I agree with number one. Number two, I agree that there needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| be a new section, C.3D. However, I think it's unwise to open at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| dimensional requirements and shrink them from 15 feet to 10 if that's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| being discussed. Now if they want to make it clear that the planting area is 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| feet but the setback is still 15, I don't have a problem with that. I think if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| open up now how deep these setbacks ought to be, we're going to open up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| whole thing. And I think that could be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| You're saying treat setback and planting separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| They're separate. That's what they decided last week, or two weeks ago, that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| were separate, distinct, different. And setbacks have the ability to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2936)|
| 0:49:01| public hearing and discuss those. If there's any changes, it's not done by a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| planting committee or something. By the Administrative Review Committee, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| does not have public notice and is not a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| Right. So we wanted to be sure the setbacks were clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| So we want to make sure the setbacks are clear and interestingly enough located in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| the section that reads location and setbacks. Just kind of made sense to me anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2958)|
| 0:49:29| So I think one thing that is left out and needs to be added is what was J.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2969)|
| 0:49:38| small C.3 in the draft that came before you last week or two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| And that's the thing that has a five-foot setback between parking lots and mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2985)|
| 0:49:54| Is that the one that's 8.3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| Yes. In the red ink, it's 8.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| The third item on the staff memo, I agree that C.8 should also be stated and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3004)|
| 0:50:17| moved back to the J.2 location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| Put the landscaping and screening in the same landscape?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Absolutely, because I don't think you want landscaping. How many trees and shrubs in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| a different configuration under different situations going before BZA. I think it makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| sense to go before the committee. That includes the professional staff of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| So once you fix the C.3 area to make sure it's clear what the distances are between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3037)|
| 0:50:45| conflicting uses, you can deal with landscaping in its own little home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Yes, and let that go before the Administrative Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| On number four, if it's followed, I think we need to make sure that it's clear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| these are setbacks. And on number five, I disagree with the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| If it means reduce the setback, if it's just reducing the screening area, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| have a problem with that from 15 down to 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| But the screening will be in J. It will be moved over to J where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| But the setback should be 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| 15 in the setback and location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Whether or not it's planted, it's a distance between properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| And one of the things, and we were having a discussion about what it actually means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| one of the things, these are non-residential uses in a residential zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| They can be large schools, large churches, clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| Those are all uses that are permitted on review in residential zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| I think many of us think that they are different from other residential uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| such as multi-family, where, you know, whether you live in an apartment or live in a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| you kind of sleep at night and are up during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| It's different from churches and schools and other uses that may have very different schedules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| I'm not sure that I know what words we're using to do that, but I understand the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| that the setback should be distinct from the landscaping requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| So, I think, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| So, Peter, I mean, so if the landscaping distance is greater than your setback, then you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3146)|
| 0:52:36| You can't have the, if your setback's 10 feet, you can't have a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| you can't have a landscaping distance of 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Then you just set your building back to 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| You're trying to distinguish that difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| You're not changing the setback, but you're putting the landscape measurement to the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| as what your setback is, because you can't build it in the landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| So, I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| So, I make a motion we accept this and with the changes that have been provided by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3183)|
| 0:53:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| First, we need a motion to approve 9, what are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| And then, I need a motion and a second to approve that, and then we'll do the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| So, I make a motion we approve 9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| What is 9C?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| That's the, that's the, what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| That's the agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| So, we have a motion and a second to approve 9C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| So, now we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Without amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| You're saying just as is at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Yeah, that's what we always do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| Right, right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| We first have to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Adopt it, and then we amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| And then we amend it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| So, Councilman Wallace, your motion is to approve these five recommendations from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Now, discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Any discussion on these five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Just those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| So, you all ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| So, these five from the law department are passed as amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| Vice Mayor Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| I have a question, just a clarification for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| Would you, I've had a couple of discussions with Mr. Greene about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Would you explain so that I can understand what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| So, I have a question, just a clarification for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| Would you, I've had a couple of discussions with Mr. Greene about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| Would you explain so that I can understand what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| So, I have a question, just a clarification for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Would you explain so that I can understand what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| So, I have a question, just a clarification for Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Would you, I've had a couple of discussions with Mr. Greene about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| Would you explain so that I'm sure in terms of what the setback requirements are under,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| this is under parking lot landscaping J1, in terms of whether or not we have landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| required in the front of all parking lots, or exactly what does that say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| No, the landscaping requirements only kick in when the lots are greater, 10,000 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| So, we've decided that's for sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| That's my reading of the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| They only start when the parking lots are 10,000 feet or greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3304)|
| 0:55:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3309)|
| 0:55:10| So, all landscaping requirements are for lots 10,000 or greater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| And then there's another break if they're greater than 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| So, there was some confusion after the last time in terms of what it really was, whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| it was plus or minus 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| So, that's what I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Are there any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| Mr. Laudery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| Let me just point out that with the amendments that you have adopted, the five amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3331)|
| 0:55:40| that came from the law department, if you pass it without making it an emergency, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| you will have passed it on first reading because there are a couple of substantive changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| there that do not need to go back to MPC, but there would be a substantive change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| would revert it back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| If you want to deal with it finally tonight, you need an amendment to emergency if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| I'm not suggesting that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| It's entirely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| I just didn't want you to do it without knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| I amend it to read on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| So, now we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| I'd like to address that because, you know, we haven't seen the words put in the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| We didn't get a marked up copy, and I'm a little concerned that we should see it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3388)|
| 0:56:33| with the words in place and be sure we understand it, but I think the emergency is not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| We'll see it in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| One of the items, number four, is if the staff memo four is followed, make clear these are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| set back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Well, you know, we don't know what the make clear is until someone writes the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| I'd like to see it in its full form, so if we pass it on first reading, we'll see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| fleshed out, and we can look at it and see if we need to tweak anything or whether we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| We may be happy with it, but I don't see why we have to have an emergency on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| It's been brewing for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| Let's make sure we read it through one more time with all the words in the right spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| So, I'm opposed to the emergency because I don't think we need it and that we benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3437)|
| 0:57:23| from a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3443)|
| 0:57:35| Vice Mayor Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| I was just going to say I agree with Councilman Della Vopi that there are some changes here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| and it's confusing enough, and I think that we ought to see it really written out, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| I think the public ought to see it written out also in terms of what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| I know there's been a lot of interest over the year over this whole ordinance, both from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| neighborhood organizations and from businesses, and I just think there's really no rush in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| two weeks in terms of where we are, and I would personally feel a lot more comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| if we have it, if we vote on what we're going to see that's right in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| So, I agree with Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| So, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Did he get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| So, we do have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| We'll vote on that first and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| So, the motion is to pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3504)|

| 1:04:33| and on and on because state requirements, state approvals, city requirements for drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| and other things are different, and I don't want to see the people in that area again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=3878)|

| 1:07:01| Is that what the extra cost beyond what's shown on the AIS is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| Can someone address that, Mr. Hagerman and Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| This one's a Parks and Recreation one, so I'm not as familiar with the details of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| but generally speaking for this grant program, $1.2 million or so is the maximum, so we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4038)|
| 1:07:27| asking for that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| If we have to match it, then there's going to be some more work that we're going to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4049)|

| 1:07:44| This particular grant is now a construction-only match grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| Not the design work and all the preliminary stuff, right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| Not the right-of-way, not property acquisition, so those other projected costs are normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4073)|

| 1:08:49| Mr. Hagerman, just to briefly tell us what's a granitoid pavement and why is it important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| It's a historic thing, I know, but it's not a common term that you see running around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| so if you might give us a little explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| Well, it's not a common term because it's a patented paving process back from around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| 1910 and before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4149)|

| 1:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4173)|
| 1:09:34| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Because, I mean, you don't hear, hey, we built a granitoid road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| There is actually a federally recognized historic district in, I forget, I think it's Iowa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4179)|
| 1:09:52| that is just Granitoid Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4192)|

| 1:14:09| We recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| I hope you were here when we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| But good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| That's your last official job as the recycling person, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4453)|
| 1:14:18| Solid waste manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| We got Jim York here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| Jim, this references the hall income tax and we did a little better than we expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| Would you just tell us about that since it's a shrinking fund coming to the city as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| legislature keeps ramping it down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Just tell us how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| For last year, we had budgeted $4.9 million from the hall income tax that came in just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| This year, it's $5.10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| So there was a gain of roughly $5.1 million in excess of what the budgeted amount was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4490)|
| 1:14:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| And that's the bulk but not the entirety of what we're proposing to spend here, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| We're proposing to use a portion of fund balance, all the proceeds from hall income tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| into fund balance at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| We're proposing to use $2.11 million from the general fund, fund balance as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4513)|
| 1:15:20| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Back of all these various projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| One other question and that is, do we have the same $4.9 budgeted for the hall income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| tax ongoing fiscal year or is it less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| We have $4.9 budgeted for 17-18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| We'll take another look at it for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| Again, we're expecting to drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| We did see a drop from prior year and we expect another drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| So again, when we get into 18-19, that number may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| I do want to correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| I think that you said $2.11 for the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| It's the $1.47, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| It's just the way Jim is calculating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| It's actually $1.4 is what we have down because of the total budget amendment was $6,560,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| All the money goes into the same place though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| I just want to make sure that what we say on the record is the same as if there's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| conflicts here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| He counts real dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| We all count real dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| I'm just curious in terms of the last item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| We have $500,000 to meet the growing demand of the homeless population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| What are some of the ideas that you have for spending that $500,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| I know I've been harping about the Broadway and the situation down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| So what are some of the ideas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| So you can see at the last item in the email memo that I sent you guys, there's items A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| through F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| And a lot of that is just outreach by different workers in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| And then I know that Chief Roush, David Brace, and a group have been getting together with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| some of the service providers in the area to help flesh out this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| And I don't know, David, if you want to talk about that briefly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| And some of it will be working on space as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| That's a big piece of it is creating a safe space that will provide opportunities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4634)|
| 1:17:24| engagement to assure safety as well as working with the service providers to provide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4644)|
| 1:17:31| services that are needed for those in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| And so those are the main focus areas that we've been discussing is connecting individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| to resources and having the right people to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| Are you finding that there are people taking advantage of the other people that are down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| Is the crime situation up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| I know that in talking with CARM there's a number of people that don't want to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4678)|
| 1:18:03| in shelters and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| So what are you finding out about the crime situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| So without going into too much detail, we are addressing that currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| And so there are some current operations taking place to deal with the criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| And so it's all part of kind of a comprehensive approach, multi-pronged approach to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| those taking advantage of the individuals that are in the situation and then working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| with those who are seeking assistance and an opportunity to get assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| And so those are all kind of comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| Like I said, without going into detail, I don't want to play our cards in terms of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| our operations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| But by doing this coordinated outreach, creating the space, the outdoor daytime space there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| under the bridge, by having social workers there, by working with Compassion Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| to provide education and outreach to faith-based churches, how they can most effectively engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| to help the folks who we routinely see there under the bridge to work to encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4751)|
| 1:19:18| to work with existing agencies, improving some of the landscaping and lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| There's an enhanced coordinated entry system, which is too complicated to explain here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4765)|
| 1:19:31| but it's something we can give you a further review of if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| But it's a way that all the agencies will be coordinating so we make sure that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| who need services, that they get identified quickly on what they need and what priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4780)|
| 1:19:46| they are in terms of vulnerability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4786)|
| 1:19:49| And then finally, a prostitution outreach program, working with another agency that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| also has some funding for that, and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| This is a comprehensive look at the situation there at Broadway and Magnolia, and it's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4797)|
| 1:20:07| cooperation, not just with the city departments we've talked about, but with the social service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4807)|
| 1:20:14| providers in the area, working with all of them to try and bring the resources that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| And we get the resources there for people, then KPD can do their job better in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| of addressing the predatory behavior and criminal behavior that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| How about just the problem with trash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| I know we're spending money, the city spends money every night to go down there and clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| Is there some plans for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| Well, that will be part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| By creating that space that we control there, then we will better be able to control the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| trash that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| I have another couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4849)|
| 1:20:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| So is this a one-time allocation of money, or will we have ongoing expense attached with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Obviously, the capital will be one time, but the operating will be ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| You'll see it in future budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| And again, it's a pilot, so we'll see how successful it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| But it's my intention to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| As you all know, we need to address that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| So the intention is to try to get some of these folks off the street and off the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| and off to the side where traffic and people can walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Is that your intention, to enforce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Yeah, the intention is to be able to enforce the laws that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4890)|
| 1:21:35| And so the challenge is it's hard to push when you have nowhere to push.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| And so that's what we're working on, is trying to find, one, defining some space where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| can provide safety, and then we can go and do the hard part, and that is the separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| of those who are seeking services and those who are seeking to prey on those who are seeking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| And so with all of that comprehensive work together, we'll be able to better clean that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| space and make it safer for everyone and for our officers to be able to appropriately do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| what we need to do to hold people accountable that need to be held accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| So has our population grown, or is it just that there's nowhere to go and that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| they're running their business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| There are a number of things that have led to it, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| And as we've attempted, it's no secret the work we've done on the creek to assure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4948)|
| 1:22:35| it's clean and safe, and that has pushed people out of those camps that they had been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4955)|
| 1:22:42| And so it's trying to fix that, finding space for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4962)|
| 1:22:49| And quite frankly, we have a void of permanent supportive housing, and that's something we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4969)|
| 1:22:56| going to have to address as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| And we've got some great examples of how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| Menville Manor and Flinican are two perfect examples of how permanent supportive housing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| And so we're going to have to get into that conversation again and start to find those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4989)|
| 1:23:17| resources to be able to provide those services, because there are individuals who need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| And those individuals are currently living under the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| And so we've got to be able to provide those services in a humane way that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5006)|
| 1:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Chief, without going into details, creating a safe place, will that include perhaps going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5021)|
| 1:23:50| into another geographical area outside of Broadway, Magnolia, or you may not even want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| So for this, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| The safe space we're going to provide is right there in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| So that'll be the initial safe space that will be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| And then outside of that, Mayor, is certainly looking at what other locations in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| that we can find to create permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| That also include more counseling services available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| So what'll happen is there are outreach workers that will be part of the spending, is to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| outreach workers there on the ground constantly being able to interact and to provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| counseling and guidance and walking many of these individuals to walk them through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| services and what's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| Well, let me thank those of you working on that problem, because it's a very serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| We're really all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| So we're glad to see that we're trying to do some positive things on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5093)|
| 1:24:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5098)|
| 1:24:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5099)|
| 1:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| Let me make a comment about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| I would encourage my colleagues to avail yourself of an opportunity to see what the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5105)|
| 1:25:11| Council on Homeless does, Mayor's Roundtable, and occasionally maybe even come to the Homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| Coalition, which met this morning, and this was one of the big topics of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5118)|
| 1:25:23| So a lot of this has been discussed and is being planned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| So what the KPD and the social services are doing together really can have a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| It's not going to be immediate, but I think we'll begin to see some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| I want to recognize David Brace and Mike Dunthorne, who have been actively working with KPD and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5140)|
| 1:25:48| the social service providers and others to put together this plan to try and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| That's our toughest situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| It's a lot simpler when people walk through the doors of one of our social service providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5158)|
| 1:26:03| and say, I want assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| And so for those who haven't or have a harder time doing that, then we need to go out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| And that's what this will, you know, it's a comprehensive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| It's a pilot, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| If this doesn't work, we do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| But we've got to, we know we have to address it, and this is what is being planned at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5182)|
| 1:26:30| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| And as he mentioned, permanent supportive housing, that's another thing come next budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5195)|
| 1:26:36| We're going to be talking about more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5196)|
| 1:26:37| We've already started talking with our service providers, our housing providers, about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5197)|
| 1:26:42| need for additional permanent supportive housing in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5202)|
| 1:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| So any other discussion about this budget amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5210)|

| 1:27:39| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| I wonder if Chief Sharp could just give us a brief report of what his crews did that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| went down to Texas and Louisiana to help out in the storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| I mean, y'all did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| We'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5272)|
| 1:27:53| Also, we have two folks who are going to be speaking in public forum as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| Go ahead, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Thank you, Councilman Delibolte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Yeah, we sent a crew down to Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| Originally, they were supposed to be down there for eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| They came back a little before that, but they were able to help out with a much larger group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5287)|
| 1:28:16| that went from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| I think there were approximately 19 fire departments, and we sent almost 100 individuals down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5302)|
| 1:28:29| to basically help after the flooding to rescue people who were still trapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5309)|
| 1:28:34| Appreciate the service of those men and women who do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5318)|
| 1:28:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| Now, we have two people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| The first is Anthony Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| I see you there, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| As you know, please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| Can you pull that down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| My name is Anthony Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| My address is 4301 Whittle Springs Road, Knoxville 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5343)|
| 1:29:09| The reason I'm here today is to speak about—some of you may not be aware of it, but there's a bus situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| at the Social Security office in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| I checked into it several times last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| I've been talking to people this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| I've been to one of the meetings at CAT, and the problem is the person that owns the car dealership next to Social Security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5364)|
| 1:29:32| has made it impossible for the buses to come inside the parking lot anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| Therefore, the only thing that CAT is left to do is they let the people off on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5377)|
| 1:29:45| Now, most of you guys drive, so I'm sure you've never seen or noticed that problem, but this is not young folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| This is old seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| They have to go down there and get copies of this, work on this problem, work on that, different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| When you get off the bus at Kingston Pike, really, really close to Social Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| you have to walk another 25 feet across a 45-degree angle of dirt and grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5403)|
| 1:30:13| I have personally seen three old ladies slip and fall and go tumbling down into the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| CAT can't do anything because the man who owns the dealership next to Social Security is the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| and I don't really think Social Security is the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| but something needs to be done to get that dealership to work out something to let the buses go back up in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| because when the bus stops at the bus stop, you can't get up there to Social Security at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5436)|
| 1:30:43| There's a fence, so they have to go 25 feet further, and then there's the driveway that takes them all up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| So these ladies are falling, and I'm sure there's some old guys, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| I see them all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| I'm on the bus all the time, and it's very, very dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| and we don't need to wait until somebody gets hit by a car to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| So I thought this would be the place to begin the situation to see if we could find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5463)|
| 1:31:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| We know where to find you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| We'll follow up with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| Y'all notice I pointed to our new COO, Deputy to the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| We'll be following up, right, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| And so it begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| Okay, and now we have Mr. Gerald Wilkerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| And please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| And you have up to five minutes, and I'll let you know when you're a minute out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| My name is Gerald Wilkerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| I live at 7228 DeVille Way in Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5507)|
| 1:31:59| I've come here tonight, well, first let me say nice to meet you, Mayor Herrera and the Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5519)|
| 1:32:16| Ladies and gentlemen of the City Council, I was a police officer for the city of Knoxville since 1973.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5536)|
| 1:32:29| Until a disability forced me to retire in 1989.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| I have been trying to obtain my badge and ID for 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5555)|
| 1:32:49| I talked to the law department, and they said the only way they could do it would be for City Council to vote an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5569)|
| 1:33:04| Because I had to retire, I couldn't do the job any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5584)|
| 1:33:10| My doctor said I'd never work again, and I haven't worked in 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170926?start=5590)|
