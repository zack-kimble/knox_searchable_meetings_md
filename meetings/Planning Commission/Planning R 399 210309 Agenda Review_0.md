| 0:00:40| I asked Amy a couple days ago, if she could arrange to have someone from the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=40)|
| 0:00:48| To talk with us briefly about the baseball proposal downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=48)|
| 0:00:53| And she has set that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| We've also, we've asked Steve wise to address the commission regarding just some formality in terms of procedures on subdivision approval concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:01:11| Plus we have agenda items to go over so it's somewhat of a tactic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=71)|
| 0:01:18| agenda review meeting. So we ask everybody's patience and I know that we've got some that need to be off by 130 so I'll turn it over to Amy and she can introduce our guests this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=78)|
| 0:01:35| Thank you, Chairman Phillips yeah we'll start off with the presentation I'll, I can circle back to the executive report I will say, I'm just real quick that I'm Chairman Phillips we didn't get a chance to talk about this but given the once I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=95)|
| 0:01:48| was reading the agenda and seeing how long it was. I did ask Mr wise just to chime in as needed as we went through the agenda items to clarify anything related to what's within the commission's purview is associated with the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:02:03| regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Hopefully that'll be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Okay, so let's go ahead and get started with our have our guests sit through my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=127)|
| 0:02:16| But we have three speakers which I'm pleased to introduce today we have Chris Caldwell he's the chief financial officer and co chief of staff for Mayor Jacobs and we have Stephanie Welch chief of economic and community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:27| She's the deputy to American cannon and Mark Manitow attorney with fast very intense, and they are here to provide you all with an overview of the downtown multi use stadium that I'm sure you all have been hearing about in the news, and they have made themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:43| available to give you a brief presentation answer any questions you might have about this exciting project so I'll go ahead and turn it over to them I'm not sure who's going to get started but maybe Stephanie or friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=163)|
| 0:02:55| So, yeah, good afternoon, or I guess it's still morning Good morning everyone. I'm Stephanie Welch for the city of Knoxville, and I hopefully everyone can see I just shared my screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=175)|
| 0:03:06| We're going to try to make our presentation brief and of course, be available for questions. At the conclusion, and so you can see some of the topics we're going to cover as we talk about this multi use stadium project, and really thrilled to be collaborating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:23| on the negotiation for this project is really important exciting projects with Knox County government and Chris Caldwell is going to get us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=203)|
| 0:03:34| And then we'll also be hearing from Mark Manitow. So, Chris, do you want to go ahead and get us kicked off. Sure, Stephanie, thanks so much and we're glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=214)|
| 0:03:44| through the high points here, what we're talking about on this project as a multi sport multi use facility. And so, the field will be configured for baseball and other sports that use a rectangular field we've had some talks in the last couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=224)|
| 0:03:59| with the minor league soccer team. And so we want this to be a multi sport facility also multi use for concerts festivals markets community and corporate events, weddings and more we saw that, as we looked at other stadiums, and also important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=239)|
| 0:04:18| to know that it's a public amenity. It's almost like a park. And if you can think of it that way we talked about it, maybe a green way, kind of connected to it but the concourse will be open for the public, except for events meaning that during the day if you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:33| to go down to the stadium and have lunch, there's picnic tables to use, read a book, do whatever you'd like to do it's open and you can exercise walk, things like that so it's open unless there are events that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:50| We very much consider this a redevelopment project is turning a decades vacant and blotted area into an asset. And so you would with that with the stadium that we configure which is, let's just call it a $65 million stadium around it will be $140 million worth of private development that comes with this project that's what makes this a very exciting project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=290)|
| 0:05:19| And it's, it's a very big economic development project where you'll see a bunch of private investments and a lot of jobs that are our construction jobs that turn into other jobs as well as we get going on this project. I think it's back to Stephanie now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=319)|
| 0:05:36| So just to give you an idea of the area that we're talking about and I think many of you are probably already familiar with the project area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:44| You can see on this slide that what what's highlighted here in blue is the proposed site of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:53| The additional orange highlights are property parcels that are also owned by Randy Boyd, or his business associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=353)|
| 0:06:03| And, you know, as Chris said, I think one of the things that is most exciting about there are many things that are exciting about this project, I would consider this to be really kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=363)|
| 0:06:16| We have a local philanthropist and investor who has been in discussion with the city for the last couple of years, last few years, about the potential of moving the Tennessee Smokies back to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:32| And moving them back to a location that's really just within a few blocks of the historic home of professional baseball in our city and keeping that investment and that public amenity in East Knoxville in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=392)|
| 0:06:46| The project site, as you'll see, is adjacent to the old city and really ties the old city in through this exciting project into East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=406)|
| 0:06:56| It's adjacent to Austin Homes, which is preserved as affordable housing in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=416)|
| 0:07:04| We have other, you know, this area over here that is around the stadium site does have some business activity, but this is largely sort of vacant and underperforming land in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=424)|
| 0:07:22| There are some great thriving businesses in the area, but there is a lot of vacant land in this area, and this entire site is vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| It's currently zoned industrial mixed use, and the project team has, you know, been in conversation, very initial conversation with Ms. Brooks about the appropriate zoning necessary for the project to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:47| And so you can, I think, see the opportunity of some of the adjacent development opportunities that will be happening with the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=467)|
| 0:07:58| I'm going to turn it back over to Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| You've heard a lot, probably, about sports authority and the creation of a sports authority by the county commission and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:11| It's important to know that we'll be appointing those board members probably next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| The stadium would be publicly owned by the sports authority. The land for the stadium would be donated by Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=498)|
| 0:08:27| I'm sure there's a deed restriction on the property, and we think it's something along the lines of as long as it's used for some sort of sporting event or sports that it would stay in the hands of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=507)|
| 0:08:43| The sports authority would then lease the stadium to Boyd Sports for Tennessee Smokies baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:52| City and county will have guaranteed booking events for a set number of community events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| In doing some research, we think that's probably seven to ten community events is what seems to be the norm in other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:09| We would have that ability to have, whether it's a 4th of July fireworks show, symphony, or one of the things that we could do, we would have that availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:23| Boyd Sports would market the stadium for events such as concerts, festivals, and other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| If you've heard Randy Boyd speak, you will hear him speak to the fact that he would like this stadium used for 300 events a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| Those 300 events would span a multitude of things because there's only approximately 70 home baseball games a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=579)|
| 0:09:47| It's going to be widely used. He's talked about making it the most used AA stadium in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| GM Community Development Group will lead the private development around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:10:01| As you hear about the private development side of this, we won't have a stake in that private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:11| but we will be able, through a development agreement, to ensure that that comes out of the ground in a phased approach at the same time as the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=611)|
| 0:10:22| Stephanie, I think it's back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| Just real quickly, I think we've already talked about some of the impact on the community in just redeveloping the economic investment, creating a public amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:36| One of the things that we've identified as a need for our community is more civic furniture or amenities that are attractive to retaining talent in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:48| We're really at a disadvantage. Knoxville has a lot of really positive attributes, but we do need to invest in that civic furniture like sports venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=648)|
| 0:10:59| entertainment venues that help attract and retain our talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| Chris touched on jobs. There's a great opportunity for small business growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| We've seen that in other cities that have invested in amenities like stadiums in their downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=670)|
| 0:11:16| Teams provide an opportunity for civic pride. It's wonderful that we have a great university sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| but we see the opportunity not just for baseball, but we're already starting to have discussions about soccer, potentially other sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=684)|
| 0:11:33| We've committed and both mayors have been very committed to ensuring there's a robust public process and that there are commitments to the community around workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=693)|
| 0:11:43| attraction and development, local labor partnerships with neighborhood schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| And we're listening to the community to hear what else people want to see happen as a result of this, this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| Obviously, one stadium is not a silver bullet to everything that Knoxville needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| We realize that we see that, but we see that this is just one more cog and one more tool in our toolbox to help with not only with civic pride and quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:11| but also economic prosperity. So key to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| I know lots of people have questions about financing and our financing guru,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| because he has helped other communities with the same process across the state is Mark Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| So I'm going to turn it over to him. Good morning, afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=745)|
| 0:12:32| I have way too many slides to in this short period of time, but just very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| Why do we use the sports authority structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| It all relates to the Tennessee Constitution and the relationship of issuing bonds to help a private entity versus traditional debt for schools and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| because of the expected long term lease to a team to manage and operate the multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| It does not it does not feasible to issue county or city traditional debt to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=776)|
| 0:13:04| So we need to go to the sports authority route. It's the same route that's been used by essentially every other major stadium in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=784)|
| 0:13:12| including all four major facilities in Nashville, as well as the FedEx Forum in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| So under this strategy, essentially, the city and the county agree to make up any shortfalls from non-property tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:30| And you may ask what those are. Those are essentially the revenues that could include sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| But primarily, most people think of those things as as fees and and pilot payments and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| that are not revenues from generated from your property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| And so we study if you want to move ahead. I'm trying to, again, keep this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| I know you have a lot to cover. This is a picture of the most visited baseball field in America by delegations from Knoxville being the Fort Wayne, Indiana baseball field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=838)|
| 0:14:13| It's a very similar stadium to what we're looking at. And you can see a lot of the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| Ours is going to be more of a if we succeed in this, more of a Wrigleyville concept where the developments even closer to the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| But there's a good example of municipal financing. They're not only doing this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| They're also doing a municipal arena, sort of something like our Coliseum, plus a municipal soccer stadium to the tune of over 100 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:41| Very ambitious mayor there in Fort Wayne. So this is a slide we've been going through a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| A lot of people ask questions about it. So where is the money coming up for to pay the debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| Again, I know you have a limited amount of time to answer questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| But the main sources would be the tax revenues off the stadium, which essentially is a two third state, one third local calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=897)|
| 0:15:08| That's obviously all new revenues. We do not have a baseball stadium out in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| So this is essentially all new revenues. And so no one loses presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| Then we're hoping to pick up the sales tax revenues from the one hundred and forty million dollar development and any other neatly adjacent development around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=918)|
| 0:15:28| That's that's generated by the stadium. We're obviously work on that legislation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Randy is projecting about one hundred thousand square feet of retail and his development alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| So that's another material payment source that we succeed as we hope to in getting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| Again, it would be a two thirds local, one third local, two third state split the way sales tax works in terms of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=945)|
| 0:15:53| Vastly new money. People coming downtown otherwise would have sat there and watched Netflix instead at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| But could there be a slight amount of transfer of sales taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Yes. But it almost certainly will be offset by tourism and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| The team is not it's not a freebie for the team. They're going to pay material rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| We're shooting for a floor of a million dollars. Obviously, that's got to be finalized out of a total, by the way, of roughly four million dollars in debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| If markets stay roughly where they are right now, the development itself will create a substantial amount of incremental property taxes surrounding the stadium using either a tip for pilot time concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=982)|
| 0:16:35| We obviously have to negotiate with the developer, the gem folks as to how that's used to promote their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| Also assist the stadium debt service. We're hoping to pick up a substantial amount of incremental revenues off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| And then only if all four of those first four revenues are not adequate to pay debt service with the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| Now, we we believe that there's a high likelihood they would pay nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| There is a likelihood that they want to pay something. We don't know what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1018)|
| 0:17:04| We've generally been saying it's probably somewhere around six hundred thousand dollars a year in a worst case scenario could be a million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1024)|
| 0:17:11| But to give you all some perspective, that is less than the projected amounts would be less than one percent of the county's debt service and less than two or three percent of the city's debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:21| I know a big stadium like this seems consequential, but if we are able to create these other revenue streams, the economic impact in terms of additional debt service to the city of the county by them agreeing to work together and collaboratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:38| Minimizes any exposure to each of them and also keeps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:43| It's really very, very small in the scheme of things, given their over eight hundred million dollar budget for the county and over four hundred for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1063)|
| 0:17:53| So this is not a material effect on their balance sheet if we move forward with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1073)|
| 0:18:01| Glad to answer any questions. Stephanie, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1081)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you so much, Mark. So I think one of the questions that we get most frequently is what's happening next and what is the timeline look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1086)|
| 0:18:14| And so, you know, one of the things I think it's important for for our community to know is that even though we've been talking about bringing the Smokies back to downtown Knoxville and the potential of building the stadium for a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:30| with the change of administration and at the city and at the county and the desire of the city and county to work together and then with covid things took a little while to get the discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:42| And we're still at the point right now where we're putting the pieces together on the front end to even be able to present a really clear proposal back to city council and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1122)|
| 0:18:52| So one of the first things that we have to do is we need to point this forward. So that's been authorized to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1132)|
| 0:19:01| But we have been working through the process of identifying and interviewing potential board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| We're hoping to bring those to bring those appointees to council and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| We're still still working on that right now, either later this month or early April, or in commission case, it will be late April, but in the next the next six weeks, we will be bringing those forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1155)|
| 0:19:30| And then the sports authority will meet where we are as we're refining, not just cost estimates for the project itself, but also, we are getting some third party verification of economic impact that will help us put together a more solid financing plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:50| We've been having community meetings and are continuing to schedule community meetings for input on design and programming and just to help get accurate information out there about what this project is, what it is not, how it will be financed, because I think one of the big misconceptions and you all have heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1190)|
| 0:20:12| And I think Mark cleared it up, is that we're really talking about a project that will be largely financed through new revenue sources that don't currently exist in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1212)|
| 0:20:24| And, you know, just making sure that people understand that, by and large, this project is being made possible, you know, for self funding or through new development that will occur as a result of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:38| So, this summer will be finalizing development agreements and lease and construction documents, bringing the agreements to council and commission for their review, because they will have to ultimately approve an interlocal agreement and the bond issuance portion by the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:21:01| If there's a pilot intent, that will have to be approved as well. And then we'll get into construction with a very ambitious goal to have the stadium open by spring 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1261)|
| 0:21:17| And, of course, that will be dependent on the rest of the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| So, with that, I think we'll open it up for questions and I'm happy to leave the screen share up or I can take it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:33| Pat, you let me know what would work best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Stephanie, if you don't just take it down and we can see who's got their hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| Stephanie, Chris and Mark, thank you for the presentation. Very informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| I see several people have their hands up and we'll take questions and we'll start out with Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1309)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips, and thank you for that great presentation. It's really wonderful to see the progress that's been made and have some just kind of macro view of all the different moving parts for this great proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1319)|
| 0:22:12| I have two questions. The first one is regarding the composition of the sports authority and what measures are being taken to ensure that it is a diverse group of individuals, both from gender and ethnic background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1332)|
| 0:22:29| And my second question is about the retail space. If you can explain if I missed it, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| Explain how the retail fits into the stadium, if it's bringing the stadium or if it's actually integrated into the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| That's my question. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| I think we're all polite and we don't want to talk over each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| I'll be happy to take the sports authority question and then kick it over to either Mark or Chris to talk about the retail component and how that relates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1371)|
| 0:23:00| So what I'll tell you is that the board will be diverse, both from a race, ethnicity and gender perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:08| So it's a small board. There are only seven members. So, you know, I think that what's been important and Mark has seen how sports authorities work across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:20| Because of their responsibility for really particularly initially developing the agreements around the development of the stadium, the financing of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:32| We need people with pretty specific skill set law, commercial development, residential development, because there's a surrounding component that's residential that we need to be keeping in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1412)|
| 0:23:46| Financing, real estate. So we have we've been receiving a lot of letters of interest and calls of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1426)|
| 0:23:58| And at this point, we're narrowing it down based on those pretty specific criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| But, you know, what's great is that even with a small city, we have diverse applicants to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| So I think people, when they see the board that is being put together, it will kind of make sense that the folks who are who have kind of risen to the top of the letters of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:29| Thank you, Stephanie. Before we move on to another person, we'll bring out that planning staff has been kind of knocked off our Zoom meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1469)|
| 0:24:38| They lost the Internet. Oh, they're back on. I see. So glad to have them back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| Also, Commissioner Graff called me a few minutes ago and said he was running a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1483)|
| 0:24:50| Stephanie, one question I had is my understanding that there is a proposal before the state legislature to recapture the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1490)|
| 0:25:06| Who's who's moving in that direction? Is that both city and county as well as Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| Yes. So we have two resolutions that we've presented one to county commission that's already been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| One to city council that's being considered tonight in support of that state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| And Mark is really has a lot of familiarity with this as does Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| So maybe one of them would want to talk about what that legislation would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| So going back to Pat, don't mean to step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| But Karen's second question really got answered as to the retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| There was a the stadium itself will clearly have typical concession stuff for stadium users.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:49| But that was not what I was talking about in the hundred thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| It would also likely have a Smokies retail store based on existing legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| That's the sales tax revenues that we already get under existing law. Is any retail within the stadium itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| The roughly hundred thousand square feet that they temper program for their development is essentially ringing the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:11| It's your typical type of moderate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| I don't want to call modernists because I'm not commenting on the architecture, but, you know, very typical mixed use retail on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| Apartments above type development with restaurants, especially retail and things like that on the lower levels with apartments largely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1582)|
| 0:26:32| I think there's one that's actually only two stories that may be all retail or something, but that's still being programmed there in an opportunity zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| They're obviously trying to determine how the best way to garner equity for their project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| And so they we can't don't really have a lot of precise information we can yet provide you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| But you can see from some of the pretty pictures that Randy shared of the thing that as to sort of where that that is, is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:59| That's a perfect segue for past questions. Pat, that was my second bullet point in my little chart is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| I mean, legislation is hard. This kind of legislation is hard. It's been somewhat disfavored in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| It used to be that I could write these legislation things and nobody would understand what we were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| It would pass easily. Now people begin to understand that it's really costing the state quite a bit of incremental sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| And so even though that they have supported a lot of these across the state and titans have a major request in for a similar bill this time, we're having to work really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1643)|
| 0:27:32| And I hope if you are supportive of this project, you will encourage your legislative representatives for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| We essentially have almost unanimous support from our legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| And we want to make sure we thank our senior first, Becky and Richard Briggs for taking, you know, leading this in the Senate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:54| Becky's our sponsor. And Jason Zachary is leading our charge for us as our senior representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:28:01| And the thing in the thing that certainly we've I think, as I said, we essentially have all of our legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| So maybe one has already agreed to be a co-sponsor. So we're really excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| But unfortunately, it's not just Knox County that we got to win over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| It's the governor's office and the commissioner of FNA to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| And so we're working hard. We have lobbyists, both the city and the county supporting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| And we have the charming Stephanie Welch and Chris Caldwell to convince the legislature when the time is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| That should certainly take care of the problem. Yes, I'm counting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| Yeah. Commissioner, he has a question. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| Good afternoon. I guess we're high noon so I can say good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| I am a county appointed member of Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| So obviously I'm a huge proponent of this project and super excited about what it can do to to Knoxville and just just many, many levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1734)|
| 0:29:06| I could go off on a bunch of different questions that probably aren't related to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| But so I would I guess my I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| One, I would assume we would see some sort of site plan coming through our body with potential overlays or redevelopment plans or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1754)|
| 0:29:25| that we would, I guess, need a plan for and hopefully plan on a fairly quick process through our our department to get that moved down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1765)|
| 0:29:36| Number one. And number two, because of where this is located, Stephanie, I'd be curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| I know there is always been an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| The previous mayor had some improvement plans on Magnolia just from an infrastructure standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| And, you know, this kind of ties close to the old city, which I think is now starting to see some new redevelopment, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| Market Square kind of took over there for a little while and now it seems like they're kind of bubbling back up from an opportunity zone standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| I know there's some opposite opportunities on overlay that kind of goes out around Magnolia with that opportunity zone kind of come closer to the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| So you could get some more redevelopment around the stadium and get that back towards Magnolia as a catalyst for more development out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| Is that something that that we're looking at? So thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| There's a lot in those questions, so I'll try to do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| So, first of all, yes, you are correct about the site plan and the, you know, sort of the land use questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1833)|
| 0:30:42| I think that conversation has started already with with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| And I think Ms. Brooks can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| There have been some emails exchanged and some presentations exchanged, and I think there are some next steps being identified there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1852)|
| 0:31:00| The second piece around the opportunity zone, this isn't an opportunity zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| And my understanding is that the private partners who were involved in the private development are looking at towards opportunity fund engagement on this particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:17| And I would see that as a potential opportunity for other property in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| And then this is also a redevelopment area. So it's an area of interest to the city for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| And, you know, we've already made some investments, obviously, in the old city, and we'll continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| Magnolia Avenue, we are working on phase three of Magnolia Avenue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| So all of those investments, I think, you know, Ms. Brooks and her team have been really helpful to us in thinking about how all of this connects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:51| So we don't want these to be five independent projects that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| But how does it connect? How does Austin Homes connect with the stadium site, connect with Magnolia, connect with the old city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| So we need to continue to keep that on our radar and planning is uniquely positioned and skilled at helping us think through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1923)|
| 0:32:12| Great. Thank you for your time. Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you, Stephanie. Let's see. Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1936)|
| 0:32:25| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips, and thank you guys for coming for that great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| The first question I have is I know you guys said you're going to be opening it up for community events, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| The surrounding schools, you know, mostly in the East Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| Will they be allowed to have sporting events since they don't usually have great facilities around these schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| And that that's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| My second question, well, my second statement is I am a downtown resident, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| And talking to a lot of my neighbors, you know, they're really worried about property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| And I've tried to tell them that that's not going to raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| But is there anything I can say to reassure them? Because they go, yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| Right now, it's not. But we pay really high property taxes in Knoxville, not compared to the rest of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| But you know how people are. They don't want their taxes raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Is there anything that you can tell me to reassure them that that will not happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2011)|
| 0:33:37| I am totally excited about this. I think that it's going to bring a different, new and exciting dimension to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:45| I just want to make sure that a my my neighbors down here are OK with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| I know that these are the revenues not going to be supported by our property taxes down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| And I'm hoping that the schools around the stadium will have a lot of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| And I think that would be just we've kind of had some issues down here the last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| And I think it would be great for kids to have a place to go in sports is something as a former basketball player.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| Sports is a great way to to build a community. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| I can take the first part of that and I can maybe go into the second part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| The first part is I can tell you that Mr. Boyd has reached out to the schools that kind of are in that area around the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2071)|
| 0:34:41| and has met with the principals and PTAs and things and getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| And I think he wants to explore maybe even starting like a sports league, which will be a baseball league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| And I'm not saying that they'll play every game in the stadium, but I'm sure they'll have some access to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| And so I think he's done a really good job of reaching out to see what those schools needs are as it relates to property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2100)|
| 0:35:09| You know, as Mark had mentioned, we can't support the stadium with property tax sources of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:19| And so they're not tied to the baseball or to the multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| And so one thing that we should point out, though, is would this development lead to growth in tax values of downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:37| It's possible. And so I think I also live downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| So as you know, even without a stadium, the values downtown continue to rise and increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2142)|
| 0:35:55| And I don't think that would be slowed by a multi-use stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| So I don't think you want to see a quote unquote a tax increase, but values may increase because of the amenities that are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:14| Mark or Stephanie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Yeah, I don't. I mean, I've heard the tax question raised in one of two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| Are you going to tax me to pay for the stadium? I mean, legally, we won't be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| I mean, but so I don't know how to respond. Of course, people say, well, you'll shift revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| I hope that people will see that this is a tiny portion of the city, county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| This in and of itself is highly unlikely to resolve any sort of tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| Well, you know, equalization occurs every four years, although Chris has explained to me that it's always ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| I mean, certainly we hope our I mean, Kelly, natural growth in values of properties help avoid tax increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| And so so hopefully we'll keep, you know, solid growth within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| We'll help people keep not only county taxes down, but city taxes down because and we'll broaden the downtown area so that there is less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| You know, Kimberly will probably. Sorry, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| But I'll keep the demand somewhat for downtown housing down a little bit because you have a bigger volume of it in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| Not so much the condos, but probably a significant number of apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| And, you know, I don't I think as to downtown itself, but hopefully we'll have a most a neutral effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| But can we it's really hard when someone has that type of question, the bullet point to say, oh, here's the proof that nothing will ever happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:36| But is it likely to happen? Not due to the baseball stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:40| I mean, basically, you've got a blighted area that's going to hopefully be made a whole lot nicer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| And we've done a lot of that. And certainly downtown property values have risen significantly over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| But this is not pretty far from downtown from an alternative real estate standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you, Mark. Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:12| Jacqueline, you're muted or we cannot hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:25| Commissioner Dent, we cannot hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2314)|
| 0:38:45| Mr. Phillips, while Commissioner Dent is getting her audio hooked up, I just wanted to make a comment back to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| Manitow's explanation of the retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| My purpose in asking that question is to understand, really, when you go to other cities and you're around one of their larger amenities like a stadium or that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:39:09| when activities aren't taking place, some cities have the approach of, you know, if it's closed, it's closed and it becomes this kind of just empty spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2349)|
| 0:39:20| even though it's actually a very vital thing just because there's not a game happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| But your answer about the integrated and non-integrated retail was what I was really hoping to hear, because that's what allows that area to stay active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2364)|
| 0:39:35| even when there's not an actual game happening at that very moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| One thing we were amazed by was the number of people using the Fort Wayne Stadium in off hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| I mean, it's a half a mile walk around the stadium covered if we do something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| It's really lovely. It's flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| It's like walking the mall without being approached by cell phone providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| So it's really nice. We hope that it will get a whole lot of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2398)|
| 0:40:10| Commissioner Dent, I see she has stepped away, but she had a question regarding the zoning requests for the retail development surrounding the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2410)|
| 0:40:22| Would it be an overall zone overlay we're looking at, or would it be rezoned in phases for each individual development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2422)|
| 0:40:32| Jacqueline, are you still not connected? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| So I guess that would be either Amy or Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| I think as Ms. Welch stated earlier, those conversations have just begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| Very preliminary. Where we are in that process is that the development team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| we need to get together and talk about exactly what they want to do and discuss the zoning that they currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| and whether or not that's going to work for what they want to do and talk about next steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| and if that involves rezoning or if it just involves submitting for special use applications or what might be by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2463)|
| 0:41:12| So those are just it's really preliminary right now, but we'll keep everyone up to date on how that progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you. I don't see any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| And again, Stephanie, Chris, Mark, thank you so much for taking time for your schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| I know all three of you are very busy, but I think it was a very informative presentation in a very limited time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:37| Again, thank you and appreciate your day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you for your service. Everyone has a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| Amy, it's all yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| OK, so I just have a few remarks. We'll circle back up to the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| I apologize. We did lose Internet connection here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Hopefully we'll stay connected through the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| So we have a new staff member and his name is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:06| One second, let me get my computer set up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Levin King Cranston, he has joined our team as a planner and he will be working closely with Michelle and Liz and Mike on review of applications and providing support to them as we begin working on some long range planning projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2531)|
| 0:42:25| We've been very busy over the past year, as you all know, and so we're really excited to have him on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| And I'm excited for you all to meet him in person, hopefully here in a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| If you have not already RSVP for the upcoming Urban Land Institute event, please do so this week or next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| This is the one real estate and land use and a rapidly changing world is the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| I'll resend this out to everybody. Planning will cover any costs associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| If you all want to participate, it's going to be on Wednesday, March 31st from 1030 a.m. till about noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2574)|

| 0:43:09| We think this is a great opportunity to engage with a really dynamic speaker expert in the field of land use and real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| And also, like I said, secure that that hour of continuing education credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2596)|

| 0:43:53| Our doodle poll on the in-person versus continuing to meet virtually was split almost evenly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2633)|
| 0:43:59| Most of you are probably aware that the governor Lee's most recent executive order extends the electronic meeting option through April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| And so staff will be prepared to move your meetings back to in-person beginning in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2646)|

| 0:44:21| We feel very confident that we can meet in there safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| And we also will be able to do a hybrid option for community members who wouldn't be able to attend in person or maybe he didn't feel comfortable attending in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:36| So we can talk more about that as we get closer to May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| We had our second planned residential stakeholder committee meeting last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| We had a robust discussion on this district and the changes that should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| The next steps for this process is for staff to review all the comments we've received since last fall and develop a proposed draft for consideration by the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2690)|
| 0:45:00| We are really grateful for everyone's participation so far. And that includes members of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Commissioners Roth, Hilton Hill and Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| And I don't know if any of you want to if you have any remarks about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| But you'd like to share with your fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| I think it was well, well prepared by staff. But, you know, there are a lot of input from the development community as well as Knox Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2718)|
| 0:45:29| You know, I think we're making progress. I think everybody sees the need to make some changes to what level we're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:37| But I think at the next meeting, Ms. Brooks is going to try to do a preliminary amendment for for us to look at and to kind of work off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2737)|
| 0:45:49| So I want to thank her and her staff for doing that. They've got a busy schedule and this is just one more responsibility on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:46:01| Commissioner Hill was there and Commissioner Ooten were also present during those meetings and they had some relevant comments to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2761)|
| 0:46:10| They want to chime in. Please do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2770)|
| 0:46:19| I see you want to turn on their mics. OK, great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| We do have a Web page devoted to this. I'll send that out just so everyone knows it's it's part of our ordinance amendments page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| And we'll share the presentation that was given on Friday and any other information that we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| And once we have drafts and a recommendation going forward, we'll use that page to share it out with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:42| So thank you. OK, so we're going to go and get into our review of agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| The first item is item number 11. It's our one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| Michelle is going to go over this, but this is a requirement of the city charter that future zoning in the city conform to the city's comprehensive development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:47:00| And we do this annually. For the entire city. So, Michelle, are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| Thank you, Amy. Here we go. So I'll try to make this really brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| There is a longer presentation for some of the newer commissioners that you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| It was our basically our public meeting that it kind of delved into the relationship of the one year plan with our other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| Excuse me. Kind of goes into the purpose and things like that. So if you find yourself unsure about what the one year plan is or what it does, then I would encourage you to go there and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2841)|
| 0:47:31| So basically, it's we do this every year and for the city charter, but it's also to strengthen the relationship between planning and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2851)|
| 0:47:40| We will go through every year and look for conflicts, both with the sector plan and the one year plan the land use designations there and also with the zoning and the one year plan designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2860)|
| 0:47:51| And so in that way it's the basis for zoning all properties with this within city limits. As you all know, if the zone is not allowed in a particular zone that someone's requesting they have to request a plan amendment with that and so that's kind of the reason for all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2871)|
| 0:48:06| It's got to be consistent with each other and that way kind of guides the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| So, this year's one year plan we really didn't change a lot every year we'll have a list of staff proposed amendments and that's kind of where we've identified those conflicts between the sector plan and the one year plan designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2890)|
| 0:48:25| And for more information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| This is our plan draft right here and on page 41, here's the list of our staff proposed plan amendments, and there you'll see here under this amendment number this is what corresponds to how we have it on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:39| So, one tool that you can use to look at is the maps that are available and that'll show you where the property is that'll show you know what they're asking for versus, you know what it was or what we're proposing versus what it was that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2919)|
| 0:48:51| But we also have this page on our website. So if you go to our www.knoxvilleplanning.org you'll see on ongoing projects on the left, and then here on one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2931)|
| 0:49:03| In the interest of time I've pre opened all these pages so when you click on that link, this is what opens up, and then you can kind of get more information on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:12| This view recording takes you to zoom you can actually view the recording on our YouTube channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| For those of you who aren't familiar you can just Google Knoxville Knox County planning, YouTube and it'll pull right up and you can just scroll through the through the different televised portions until you get to the one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2958)|
| 0:49:31| But to look at the interactive maps that we have you can click on here it says view maps and that'll bring you to our interactive map series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2971)|
| 0:49:39| And so again going back into our plan this amendment number number three on website under staff proposed amendments, you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| Once you hit that view map, it'll pull up this web page it's got all these tabs across the top if you activate the one year plan staff amendments, then you'll see all these numbers across here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2986)|
| 0:49:58| You're going to go to amendment number three to kind of look at okay where is that property located, and you kind of get more of a context, this way, so you can see these two properties here we're proposing to change because clearly they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:10| They shouldn't be designated right away so we're just going to make that correction via the one year plan it's that's the kind of things that we typically propose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3010)|
| 0:50:17| So if you want to go through the one year plan and look at each one of those amendments you can do so on this website here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3017)|
| 0:50:26| So the next thing that we have in here is a list of some of the zoning conflicts so you all may be aware that after planning commission approved the one year plan last year it went to Council for vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3026)|
| 0:50:38| And as part of their vote, they removed the are in three zone from the allowed zones within the LDR land use class, and they removed the RN five zone from the medium density residential ladies class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:50| So these are some conflicts that resulted from the removal of those sounds from that land use. We're not proposing to do anything with it we're just trying to get the information out there, we can see if their property was affected and kind of let everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3050)|
| 0:51:04| So, this is just kind of a overview of how many properties were affected by that decision, and kind of how it affects things in the city so overall looking at all the zones including our in three and our in five it affected 1136 properties that's how many conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3064)|
| 0:51:20| And a lot of that or is resulting of the new zoning ordinance with the old land use designations and as we do the sector plan updates and one year plan updates will bring these more and more into alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3080)|
| 0:51:32| But the RN three and five zones resulted in 227 new conflicts, affecting 505,594 properties and so when you look at it from a property perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3092)|
| 0:51:45| It's about half, almost half of the zoning conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| There are too many of them to list. So again, if you go to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| The plan itself the draft, there is a list of all of them and so you are able to kind of either see them that way looking at it this way, or on our interactive maps series, move my zoom stuff over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3113)|
| 0:52:07| Under reclassification conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| And again, because there are so many that it's not a list that you can just click on oh it's number three or number four that you want to see because there's just so many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| So what you'll have to do is basically just zoom in close to a property if you know the area that you live in can zoom in on it and kind of see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3138)|
| 0:52:26| And here's an example of some are in three properties that are in LDR and that's one of the conflicts. This is one way that you can do that on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3146)|
| 0:52:34| And then the final change that we made to the plan was reintroducing a paragraph to the land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| And this is just to clarify and emphasize that is zones inclusion and the list of allowed zones for a land use doesn't necessarily mean that all zones within that that list are appropriate for a given property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:54| And then it goes on to say that the Planning Commission and City Council are obligated to recommend and approve the best zoning districts within the conforming range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| And so this that language was in plans prior to this one it was taken out last year and we're putting it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:09| So that is it for one year plan I'll open it up to questions and see if there's anything I can help you guys with questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3189)|
| 0:53:22| I don't see any hands raised Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| Now we'll move on to resigns and plan amendments so item number 12 on the agenda 12 be 21 RC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:32| We've talked about this before but it's been postponed, I believe a couple times so this request is for 2002 Thunderhead Road in Southwest County, they're requesting a removal of a plan development overlay as well as a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3212)|
| 0:53:48| So you guys are familiar with where it's at I won't go into that again because as Amy said we've talked about it several times so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| I will say in comparing the two zones, the one that they're asking for CG and then what they're coming from CR. There's been a lot of correspondence on this and people concerned about the multifamily dwellings and multifamily dwellings are allowed in all the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3235)|
| 0:54:11| zones, or all the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Through here whichever base zone they have the multifamily would be allowed so whether or not you rezone the property. If the PD is removed, that would be, that would be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3254)|
| 0:54:25| So looking a little bit at the zone comparison and we've talked about this before as well but the zone they're asking for the CG three has setbacks that are more similar to what was approved as part of the master plan and so any kind of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3265)|
| 0:54:41| under the C3 jump, C3s up CG three zone would be more consistent with the development that would occur under town town center district planning for before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3281)|
| 0:54:56| And so, kind of getting into a timeline of the events and I don't want to muddy this too much because there's been so many cases for town center, just in general, since its annexation in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3296)|
| 0:55:09| So trying to hone in a little bit more closely on just this particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| The approved master plan in 2004, this was the land use that was shown so it's a mixed use course the orange and then the medium density residential was around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:25| And this is part of, you know, the plan in general and there's another slide on this a little bit later but it kind of shows how the residential wraps around the mixed use core in the middle with some open space kind of dispersed throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:40| And just a little bit closer view on this there was originally supposed to be walking trails, this was the road configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3340)|
| 0:55:48| And then that kind of gradually started to change this is another slide of that 2004 this shows the boardwalk, a little bit more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3348)|
| 0:55:56| And then this shows this particular properties uses a little more clearly so this has future buildings and assess parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:56:07| And then in 2011 the plan shifted and you can see that that parallel building type no longer exists and now they're they're proposing to angle the buildings, set them farther back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3367)|
| 0:56:19| And then that plan also changed a little bit as the road network change and so then this became what was going on so before the road came up this way and this went farther along this way now it's got more of an angle, more room in this very and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3379)|
| 0:56:35| here so that's kind of how the plan has changed and what that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| This is an overlay taken from a request later that shows that core peripheral area that we were talking about that has the residential land use around with the green space throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3400)|
| 0:56:51| And how that affected everything so with the new road configuration, coming through here, you can see these core areas no longer align with the road boundaries or the parcel boundaries and the original master plan called for and I'm just kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:57:05| of meeting from along the side, a mixed use core area of retail office and residential uses, that's the orange spaces and then the peripheral area that includes a mix of low and medium density residential which is these white spaces here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3425)|
| 0:57:19| The residential component was to include single family lots townhouses and apartments, and the commercial component was to feature a theater big box retail small shops restaurant space and office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:31| So according to the master plan apartments could essentially go right here on this parcel but they wouldn't be able to go through here. The interesting thing about how these two areas align on this property is that kind of sets up discordant development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3451)|
| 0:57:46| So on the one hand you have a residential called for on ground level, and on the other you have a more urban type of design with everything's attached or close together you've got retail or commercial or restaurant or something like that on the bottom with residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:58:00| on top. And so, removing the master plan kind of helps to clean that up a little bit. So it could, you know, you can make it all core all peripheral or whatever that that's not really what's at play here it's removing the master plan, so that the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3480)|
| 0:58:16| itself would take over in terms of uses, and the uses in the core area in particular are very similar to the uses that are allowed in both CR two and CG three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3496)|
| 0:58:28| So again the zone that they're coming from this and that they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| So there's not a whole lot of difference between these is I guess it's just a question of where that would be applied. And then finally in 2014 this was a plan that was approved that subdivided the land into different parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3514)|
| 0:58:47| And because of side setbacks and things like that that kind of introduces a different land use where you've got individual businesses with their own parking and what that looks like on each individual site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3527)|
| 0:58:59| So, the confusing thing about this is that as these plans came through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| The master plan itself was never changed to reflect this so the master plan is no longer a living breathing document it's sort of a documentation of what was originally approved back in 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3546)|
| 0:59:18| And then, as plans have changed it's caused all these, all these problems. And now that we have the this process of removing the special use it's kind of bringing all these things into light where it actually has to come before this board to be removed whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3558)|
| 0:59:33| before they could just change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| One of the recommendations that we're making is regarding the boardwalk and that's to kind of keep that boardwalk design, remember from along in here, which is kind of strong, quite a bit, but we're proposing to to keep that piece of it so that it still makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3578)|
| 0:59:57| the pond open to the public for their enjoyment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| But other than that we are recommending approval of the zoning change because the uses would be similar to what was allowed before and to remove the removal of the master plan because it helps to kind of clean up the problems with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3601)|
| 1:00:17| Any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| Questions I don't see any hands raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| Okay, now we move on to our number 14 is to eat 21 RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| This is Eric Garcia salads, and it's also Michelle's case this is a request to rezone from CG to to CG wants to similar to the item that commission considered recently in your Westtown mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3638)|
| 1:00:52| So I'm just to orient everyone with this site this is a little bit north of the townsville Pike interchange with Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| Also just north of the interstate 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| And looking at the development there's plenty of commercial development up and down North Broadway, and it was developed under the old zoning and so buildings are set a little bit further back everybody has their own parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3662)|
| 1:01:16| This is kind of the pattern that's been established and so when we came through to redesignate these different zones and kind of look at what exactly we thought was best with what community interaction that CG three, or sorry, CG to zoning what was applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3676)|
| 1:01:32| And so that is kind of, it's got to start at some point the development pattern to change you know zoning doesn't stay the same into the future forever and so you're looking into the next decade or two and how development starts to proceed and creating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3692)|
| 1:01:47| more consistency along these lines if you've got a bill to set back of zero to 20 feet, then the building start to move closer up and there starts to be more consistency as you move up and down the street of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3707)|
| 1:02:01| The other thing that's interesting with this property is it's a good portion of it is in the floodplains you can see 500 and 100 floodplains and so that built to zone actually benefits, the property because it pulls it farther from these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3721)|
| 1:02:14| and kind of helps protect it more from flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| The main reason that we're recommending denial is just because there's not been a change of conditions to warrant a rezoning, so it's not really been a population increase there's not been any sort of new, new roads new development utilities, anything like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:32| that and that's one of the criteria for rezoning is to meet that and there were no changes of conditions that we could find that I will open it up to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3752)|
| 1:02:47| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| Thank you, Chair Phillips, Michelle, as you compare this to, I think it was called the take five project, just west of Westtown mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3771)|
| 1:03:02| Do you see any major differences in, in how these are are viewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3782)|
| 1:03:11| As far as the CG to and CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| And I would just like to add, I think we voted this down at commission, very narrowly may have been a 687 something like this. And I think it went on the city council and Council may, I want to say it was unanimous that they overturned it to allow CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3794)|
| 1:03:32| Is that correct. Amy Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Michelle, could you comment on the differences, as you compare it to the take five project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| Do you mean their site plan or do you mean they use it so I'm just I'm just saying the walkability, you know, CG to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| you know, I really supported this, the rezoning the recode, and I still do. And, but, but I, I am thinking a little differently about how CG to is applied in some of these high traffic areas and I'm, believe me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:04:13| I would love to see less automobile use and more pedestrian use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| But we also have to just understand the reality of it too and, you know, will this area ever be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:28| It's a tough question. I'm not sure any of us can answer it today but it does limit drive throughs in a big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3868)|
| 1:04:38| CG to does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| And since the uses are the same. I just, I just, I like to see a little more flexibility in the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3880)|
| 1:04:52| I'm not saying that there's a better way I'm just expressing my struggles with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3892)|
| 1:04:59| Now I understand and that's a valid point I mean, as it stands right now North Broadway would probably be a miserable walk I've never attempted to walk it but I did park right here but the sign across and it was, you know, not a pleasant experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3899)|
| 1:05:14| But part of part of changing that development pattern and things like that, I guess, you know, part of making an area more walkable is to try to make it a more enjoyable walk and so if you're adding, you know, better sidewalks to buildings closer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3914)|
| 1:05:29| street with parking towards the rear and things like that and you're kind of limiting that that vehicle interaction along the front end where the sidewalks are I think that certainly helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3929)|
| 1:05:39| With that said, it's a really lengthy process I mean it's something that would take decades to see a difference on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| And that I think that becomes sort of the question to, you know, if you're, if you're basing the rezoning on the conditions on the ground now then conditions wouldn't ever change I think it starts to become about what do you want to see and how can we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:58| help get it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And so if CG to is, you know, it's got the design components that talk about the administration on the front it talks a little bit about the site plan and orientation of sidewalks, providing a sidewalk from the street to the door of the of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3961)|
| 1:06:16| that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| All those contribute to the, the aesthetic appeal of a space and I think all of that does kind of encourage pedestrian activity at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3978)|
| 1:06:28| Obviously there would also need to be, you know, maybe as if we saw more pedestrian activity there could be more crosswalks at some of the red lights and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3988)|
| 1:06:38| I can't imagine if you like playing a game of ballroom try to cross the street now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| So, you know, that's I guess that's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| Mm hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| I share commissioners hill perplexity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| The question that I'm facing is, is twofold. One is, we do need to abide by the decision criteria and moving forward. And so we need to take a close look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:07:14| On the other hand, there needs to be provision for these more auto oriented businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4034)|
| 1:07:23| Then on the other hand again, perhaps the problem isn't the zoning but that the law is an inappropriate shape or size for the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4043)|
| 1:07:33| And so maybe the problem is inherently doing is physical with the property and the use, and not as much the other factors of design and decision criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4053)|
| 1:07:49| I have no solutions. I just feel that the CG one will continue to be desirable, because of its lack of aesthetics, and that there are design standards that would be a compromise, providing more auto oriented use but yet providing an aesthetic feel for pedestrians, walking along the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:08:13| I totally agree with that and I think a lot of the problem with the last one is, you know, there were two uses they were trying to squeeze on the spot and so I think had it just been one or the other, it probably wouldn't have been an issue for them to put that use there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4093)|
| 1:08:28| lot. I mean I think they're, they're probably facing some of the same challenges. It's a smaller lot I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4108)|
| 1:08:36| But, yeah, and it's it's almost got a corner type configuration because of the entry to the shopping center and so what does that do to your access and things like that so I think it's also a challenging site for slightly different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4116)|
| 1:08:49| Mr wise has his hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| Yeah, I just wanted to remind commissioners with the adoption of recode a aggressive new standard for amendments or rezoning amendments now exist that didn't occur before, and it's been kind of downplayed and it's also been ignored by the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4133)|
| 1:09:13| Blunt about it with an example that Commissioner Hill pointed out earlier, but it's the ordinance now requires a specific finding that the amendment is necessary because of substantially changed or changing conditions in the area or district affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:31| And since we have since the zones are put in effect. Last November, or whenever, November year ago whenever rezoning scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4171)|
| 1:09:40| It's hard to envision seem to me hard envision how there's been a material change of circumstance to justify a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| And it's a it's a real dilemma. This is this is a recording rather draconian provision you don't find it in most zoning ordinances but for whatever reason it was put into recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4188)|
| 1:10:00| I suppose the policy was designed to discourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4200)|
| 1:10:07| There's something out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| Some activity going on either new roads or something to justify it, but I'm just want to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4209)|
| 1:10:18| And but at the same time tell you that it may be an untenable provision in the long term because city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| At the first bite just like Tim pointed out you are split on whether to change the one in West Knoxville which probably violated the zoning ordinance but then the city council given the same opportunity unanimously changed it and they to have basically ignored the provisions of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4225)|
| 1:10:44| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| That's why you all will see that in our staff reports we really have tightened up our recommendations, and we are closely following that zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4246)|
| 1:10:54| You know, as it currently reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I want to echo what he'll have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| And also, and I said this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| I think Rico certainly has a lot of good things involved in it. And I think, you know, it goes over an area but we said this just a few minutes ago about the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4277)|
| 1:11:30| And we were talking about it, that it may fit the area, but not necessarily an individual property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4290)|
| 1:11:38| And, and keep it in mind also that what the property was on before we code was allowed would have allowed what they're asking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4298)|
| 1:11:50| And even though it's just a setback. It still changes the overall use of the property and I think that they, they presented some good reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4310)|
| 1:12:01| Even though we say nothing's changed well I would submit that it did change Rico changed the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:08| And I think we should consider that with individual properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| And I think I don't, I don't really see a problem with what they're asking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4332)|
| 1:12:19| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Yes, this is also building off of what Commissioner Hill brought up. Can someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| I thought that the meeting right after the one where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| And then the city council voted to allow the applicant, I'm speaking of the Kingston pipe case to proceed with the change in zone that Councilman Roberto had put forth a request for design standards to be put into CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:57| Is that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| So he has is on the agenda for tonight's city council meeting, and he is asking planning to add the development or the consideration of design standards and CG one to our work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4380)|
| 1:13:15| So they will be voting tonight on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| Okay, so thinking futuristically, if that does pass tonight, then planning would be taking care of this particular issue in adding some design standards to CG one that could help us since we've seen two of these close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4397)|
| 1:13:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| Yes, potentially. So what we would do is we would take it and we would add it to our, our work program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| I can't tell you right now when we would get to that. We have a number of items on our work program, but we would study it and make a recommendation to to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4422)|
| 1:13:51| And then you all would make a recommendation on the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4431)|
| 1:14:02| I don't see any other hands raised. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| Move on or maybe run out of time given the number of genomes we have number 19. This is Benjamin Mullins 321 RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4446)|
| 1:14:14| This request is a another rezoning request for property on Greenway Drive and it's Michelle's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4454)|
| 1:14:23| Thank you. So, this is another one that you guys have seen before it was back and in November that this request originally came through and it got postponed and changed and and postponed again and so now it's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4463)|
| 1:14:36| A fresh, fresh face I guess so they're asking for the RN for now versus our fives which they were asking for before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4476)|
| 1:14:45| So this is located to the east of Broadway just above interchange with 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4485)|
| 1:14:51| Future land use map shows the properties designated as NPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4491)|
| 1:14:58| And I'm not sure why that show in blue it's it's NPR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| The zoning map is shows it as our in one so as the properties were re designated they were given the RN one designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| Due to the larger lot sizes on both sides of Greenway the type of uses on a property that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4509)|
| 1:15:16| And so they were the only properties zoned are to prior to the change in zoning all along Greenway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4516)|
| 1:15:27| The FEMA map shows that there are some floodways and floodplains towards the rear of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4527)|
| 1:15:35| I'm currently recommending an RN to zone designation instead of the RN for, and a couple of different things to kind of delve into with this one and I'll go over to KGIS for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4535)|
| 1:15:51| So we had some cases come through recently this particular one right here on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4551)|
| 1:15:58| There's one of these properties in here now that I'm clicking on this this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| So the applicant asked for RN three, they had an existing duplex on the property we recommended RN two so that you know the plans would have to come before this body and be judged and in that past that was the recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4562)|
| 1:16:16| The recommended zone to city council who is it so this applicant asked for RN three and got RN two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| These properties are these few here right across the street just recently also went to RN two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4582)|
| 1:16:27| And so, if we have this one applicant over here that's asked for RN three which is lesser than what this applicant is asking for and we denied him his request or recommended a lesser zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4587)|
| 1:16:39| I would, I would challenge you to think about what would be the reason to approve this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| And so the current use of the property this one right here has a multifamily building I can't tell exactly how many units are it looks like it might be maybe eight maybe 16 depending on how many stories and how many windows encompass each unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4604)|
| 1:17:00| This property here is a duplex and so part of the new zoning code talks about non conformities and so anything that was considered legal conforming at the time of the zoning change would still be allowed to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4620)|
| 1:17:13| So, the applicant doesn't have to change the use or anything like that he is able to make repair and maintenance type upgrades to his property that sort of thing it doesn't prohibit him from from maintaining and running the property how he was doing before the zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4633)|
| 1:17:28| This is just to to protect future development so if the applicant ever decides to sell the land or redevelop, you know, what does that look like under the RN for zone there's a lot sizes of 5000 square feet which would be out of character with the general area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4648)|
| 1:17:43| It would also allow up to 35 dwellings on the property and so you know is that what you see for this area as well so it's not just looking at what's there now what's there now can stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4663)|
| 1:17:53| It's really about looking at that future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| And what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| And without opening up to any questions anyone might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| Michelle. Any questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| Let's move on to agenda item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| This is one C 21 rz one e 21 pa one e 21 sp this is Benjamin ones on behalf of Hilton capital group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4695)|
| 1:18:26| We had quite a bit of discussion at the last meeting on this one this was sent back for staff to work with the applicant on splitting this out and I'll let Liz, take it from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4706)|
| 1:18:39| I'm sharing my screen just want to make sure folks can see it. Can I get a thumbs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| So, this was discussed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| However, the applicant has now requested to modify the area that they are applying for for the rezoning sector plan amendment one year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4732)|
| 1:19:02| The original area was a 39 acre site, and they have now modified their request to a 21.9 acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4742)|
| 1:19:10| They are still requesting the RN five zoning, and the MD are land use plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4750)|
| 1:19:18| This is what an aerial shot looks like before, if you can see, I don't know if you can actually see my annotate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4758)|
| 1:19:29| If you can see this area, the previous rezoning request extended all the way up to the top of the ridgeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4769)|
| 1:19:39| And this is what the sector plan and when your plan designations look like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| So you can see that the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4785)|
| 1:19:49| And this is what the sector plan and when your plan designations look like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| So you can see that the last few areas along the south side of merchant between Clinton Highway and pleasant Ridge Road have some existing built out medium density residential areas that are designated in both the one year plan and sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4794)|
| 1:20:09| And this site is adjacent to one of those areas to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| When we look at the zoning, we can tell that the current zoning is not in line with the sector plan or the one year plan the current zoning on the property is neighborhood commercial on the front half, and then agricultural and hillside protection on the rear portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4815)|
| 1:20:34| When we do a slope analysis on this reduced area, we see that for that 21 acre site they would have a disturbance maximum of 19.47 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4834)|
| 1:20:47| And then, of the area within the hillside overlay, which is 6.12 acres, they could only disturb about 50% of that area so that would be primarily the area that you see speckled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4847)|
| 1:21:06| This is one of the more unique areas in that it is serviced by both sidewalks and transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4866)|
| 1:21:13| There are cat bus stops at this location along merchant. It's also in the parental responsibility zone for Northwest middle and Norwood elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4873)|
| 1:21:25| We've had a number of community comments come up related to transportation safety issues along this section of merchant road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4885)|
| 1:21:35| And because of that, I would just like to sort of float these conditions forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| And because of that, I would just like to sort of float these conditions forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| And not sorry conditions these considerations forward and hopes that the developer, the city of Knoxville and cat could pursue to address some of the safety issues during the development of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4907)|
| 1:22:00| The first of these being safe access to the cat bus stop alongside walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| And ideally the developer should coordinate cat on this safe crossing from the sidewalk from the site to sidewalk on the north side of merchant roads at this census project is proposed for the south side, and making sure that that crossing maximizes visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4925)|
| 1:22:22| and limits exposure to pedestrians and potential conflict areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| So the more appropriate location for entrance to the site should be in the three lane section of merchant drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4949)|
| 1:22:40| You can see here in the photos that transitions from two lanes on this side to three lanes on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4960)|
| 1:22:49| And ideally the entrance to the site should be located in the three lane area, where it would be safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4969)|
| 1:23:00| And this is just showing where the existing cat bus stop is at the corner with, I believe, Whitaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4980)|
| 1:23:09| This is the difference between the NDR and NDR land use, and when your plan designations, again, the zone districts that are called for in the NDR designation are limited to our in three and four, and NDR allows consideration of also are in five, six, and office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=4989)|
| 1:23:35| And looking at the types of residential uses that are allowed, townhouses are permitted as special use in our in three, and in our in five, they are just a permitted use, and however multifamily is also permitted use in our in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5015)|
| 1:23:54| This is an example of what the two zone districts dimensional standards look like. You can see they're pretty similar. However, our in five does allow consideration of multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5034)|
| 1:24:12| Again, the land disturbance maximums would be the same under our in three or our in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| But since there is a difference in the housing types that are allowed. I wanted to bring attention to the fact that we do have concerns related to the missing middle housing, and I'll describe this a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5059)|
| 1:24:32| In the next couple of slides, but this slide is showing the residential building permits from 2009 to 2019 detached dwellings, or just traditional single family residential one family homes is shown as blue on here and attached or two family homes are duplexes are shown by the yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5072)|
| 1:24:57| And then the orange represents multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| So you can see that over the last 10 years only one sixth or 17% of all the housing units in the northwest county sector were single family attached units, which are primarily duplexes and townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5100)|
| 1:25:15| If we look at this number countywide, we can see that over the last 10 years, only 6% of all housing units were single family attached. Again, primarily being duplexes or townhomes and looking at affordability for housing in the northwest county sector, where this is located along merchant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5115)|
| 1:25:39| We can see here the darker the red area means the more burdened homeowners are by the price they pay per month for mortgages and sorry that first image is from 2005 to 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5139)|
| 1:25:56| This next image is from 2010 to 2014 so you can see that cost burden growing in the sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| You can see this growing again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| And this is the 2015 to 2019 American Community surveys data from the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5166)|
| 1:26:17| So pulling from this data we can look at rental affordability for the sector versus the county, and between 2015 and 2019 93.4% of renters under the age of 65 were cost burdened in the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5177)|
| 1:26:35| And generally cost burden means that someone is paying more than 30% of their income related to their housing costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5195)|
| 1:26:47| And we can see the number, you know, for those 65 and older, it drops down to 6.6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5207)|
| 1:26:56| So there's a need for alternative housing types to just single family residential and just apartment in this sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5216)|
| 1:27:06| And I just want to remind everyone that the other required standards related to townhomes landscaping required for yards, as well as the other standards for townhomes related to articulation and transparency and building separation for the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5226)|
| 1:27:33| Any other questions regarding our recommendation for our entry versus our five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5253)|
| 1:27:41| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Thank you, Liz Can you go back to the slides where you were talking about the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Just to put a definition to what missing middle housing means in housing terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5272)|
| 1:28:03| It is the mobile home and the attached dwelling. Is that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| No, so mobile homes would not fall in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| It would be just attached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| Those are primarily duplexes and townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| So it is attached dwellings, which mean townhomes and duplexes that are really missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| That's the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Yeah, generally nationwide the definition for the missing middle includes, you know, four plexes five plexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5306)|
| 1:28:37| But this is the easiest way for us to identify this number, because we track attached dwelling versus multi dwelling and single and detached dwelling in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5317)|
| 1:28:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| Any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| Any other hands up. Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| I have a quick question if you guys can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| Yeah, I'm glad you can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| My question was I heard that the agricultural portion left they could disturb up to 50% of that, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5348)|
| 1:29:19| So, they would have to come forward with some sort of plan for disturbance for that area and they would be limited to the uses allowed in the agricultural district would would multifamily be one of the uses allowed and okay okay cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5359)|
| 1:29:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| Okay, so we'll move on to concepts development plan special uses you some reviews number 21 is three essay 21 also includes a use on review three be 21 you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5387)|
| 1:29:56| It's the Murphy red subdivision, and it's, I'll turn this over to Mike, he's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5396)|
| 1:30:04| And I meet myself. Thank you everybody for having. I'm going to try to go over the couple of these pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5404)|
| 1:30:12| Especially the first one, the Murphy road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| We've had a lot of the comments are related to road conditions on Murphy road is a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5415)|
| 1:30:24| If you're familiar with Murphy road it's it's north of east center mall center mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5424)|
| 1:30:34| And kind of between Washington Pike and Haswell Pike Shannon Valley farms subdivision which is a larger subdivision this area is the opposite side of the road and this property was is owned by the same developer and was kind of a phase of it at one point in time, it kind of still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5434)|
| 1:30:55| But the 2006 there was a townhome development proposed for the site that had 100, little over 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5455)|
| 1:31:05| At that time, a traffic or turn turn lane was going to be required on Murphy road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5465)|
| 1:31:12| They came back at with a development with 42 units with single family, and the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5472)|
| 1:31:21| They had a new traffic study done that showed that a timeline was not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| Because this application did not meet the threshold of our traffic impact study requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| They're requesting 61 lots here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| However, we know that somewhere between 42 and 100 and little over 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5500)|
| 1:31:44| There was a need for a trap turn lane, and with the increase of traffic on Murphy road staff we did not feel comfortable, allowing more than 42 units without a traffic impact study be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5504)|
| 1:31:55| So there's a condition condition number three that no more than 42 lots may be plotted in this subdivision until they update the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5515)|
| 1:32:05| And that would be reviewed by both planning staff and not scanning engineering staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| If that traffic study does show that a timeline is warranted they'll need to install that timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| So, let me go to the plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| So everyone's aware, you do see that there's a stub out on road, I guess, Stoney Stoneyhurst drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5541)|
| 1:32:29| There is a future opportunity for additional units to be requested on the southeast port or southwest portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5549)|
| 1:32:39| So this could get to be a bigger development than it is currently shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| Does anybody have any questions on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| Mr Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| Thank you. I had a couple questions if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| The first one is, there was a reference in the staff report regarding open space in the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5578)|
| 1:33:07| And could you explain to me the requirement for open space within a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5587)|
| 1:33:16| And for the Innsbruck one maybe the Innsbruck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Yeah, I think it was the Innsbruck but I think it might apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| Yeah, so there's a provision in the in the subregs that says 10% of the gross land area could be required to be dedicated for some kind of public use it's like a school or parks, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5603)|
| 1:33:36| But that's the way I read that section it's truly talking about something open to the public or dedicated to the public, versus a, a HOA maintained part for the residents of the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5616)|
| 1:33:53| I don't know if that if that answers your, your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5633)|
| 1:34:00| So that as an interpretation of the, of the code you could you send me later what where's that section is in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5640)|
| 1:34:10| Yeah, it's written in Innsbruck staff reports it references the section number there, or should it doesn't then just obviously reach out to me I can get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5650)|
| 1:34:20| Yeah, we'll send it to you it's 3.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| It's on page 85 of our subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| Now I thought that the Montessori school across the street had a very interesting letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| And I was wondering about the fact that it, although it's a private school, you still have students on a busy street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5675)|
| 1:34:43| And was there any traffic safety measures that might be required of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5683)|
| 1:34:53| Not, not specifically for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| They the county look at its sidewalk policy, its ordinance, and the time they, they determined that their, their ordinance would not require them to install a sidewalk along their frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5696)|
| 1:35:11| This, the developer has mentioned that this, this subdivision may be associated with the Shenandoah Valley Farms subdivision across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5711)|
| 1:35:23| They mentioned that they might share amenities but that was not a given at this point that's something they're gonna have to discuss more between the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| But if they did share amenities and they would be installing a site, a crosswalk on Murphy road but that's, that's not necessarily part of our, our review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5731)|
| 1:35:42| So something they're considering so outside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| Another has not been any other pedestrian facility discuss at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5746)|
| 1:35:53| So a private school does not have a parent responsibility zone that's only holds for public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5753)|
| 1:36:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| Let's see the other hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Yes, so this might be a general question just like an informational so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5773)|
| 1:36:21| you're recommending approval for 61 lots, and if we approve it County Commission approves it, then they have to plot or plot, each one of these lots and before they get to 43, they have to have a traffic study done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5781)|
| 1:36:41| Yeah, so it wouldn't have to go beyond the planning commission approval wouldn't have to go to County Commission, but yes, they could not find any more than 42 lots before they have to get a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5801)|
| 1:36:53| So pretty much with this plan as it stands, they would have to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| If they plan to plant all of these lots. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5822)|
| 1:37:13| Question for me. So, after the traffic study does it come back to planning commission or is it handled administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5833)|
| 1:37:25| It'd be handled administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| And can we get safety features such as a crosswalk at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5853)|
| 1:37:41| That might be a good question for Knox County engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| I guess it depends on what's what kind of facilities, the crosswalk is going to if it's just crossing the road or, you know, if it's in relation to going to the school, and that's a different situation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5866)|
| 1:38:02| But, yeah, I think that'd be a question for Knox County engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| Okay, I'll wait till Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5888)|
| 1:38:13| Thank you, Mr. Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| I'm actually Commissioner Corbett question made me have a follow up question. So that traffic study would be done after, you know, lot number 43 is plotted and handled administratively, up until the point of that possible future development in the back of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5895)|
| 1:38:32| property right then that would that would come back before us and they would probably need another traffic study to study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5912)|
| 1:38:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| Well that they could that the development would have to come back to the planning commission for review, they want to build out that future phase, they could go ahead and assume a certain amount of units within the traffic study now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5922)|
| 1:38:59| And that way, they basically cover what their future potential development is as well. As long as what they ultimately request doesn't exceed it or change the types of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5939)|
| 1:39:14| You know, if, if anything, they may have to just do a minor amendment to the traffic study or like a traffic impact letter just to update the findings of it based on new new number units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5954)|
| 1:39:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Yes, this is a question about how this particular development relates to case I think last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5972)|
| 1:39:45| Correct me if I'm wrong. There's a question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| The extension of a larger lane road is going all the way up to Murphy from the interstate is that correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=5988)|
| 1:40:04| There is a city is improving Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6004)|
| 1:40:13| And I'm not overly familiar with exactly all the components of this, I believe it goes from where target is like where Washington Pike takes the hard right going east, northeast, and it goes up to Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6013)|
| 1:40:31| I'm not sure if it goes beyond Mill Road or not I that's not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| Okay, I may be incorrect, but my thinking was that when we reviewed it last month that went beyond Mill Road and all the way to the intersection with Murphy, which is, there's a Wigles there, and a little dollar general store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6036)|
| 1:40:57| That could be wrong but I'm bringing that up in context of this because of the amount of traffic that I'm imagining this starts to introduce along Murphy, if it, if I'm right and that road improvement is bringing more flow to that light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6057)|
| 1:41:21| And then there's this development that is being planned over here, I feel like there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| There is a increased concern for what's happening on Murphy road that perhaps is different than what we might see if we're just looking at this development in isolation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6086)|
| 1:41:40| We can find out about that plan improvement on Washington Pike and just verify where, where it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| Yeah, agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| For consideration, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| So, we can find out more details and send it out to you all in terms of what that will look like, and it might and there's a potential that it might change, but I'll follow up after after this evening's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6113)|
| 1:42:04| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| Mr Corbett. Do you have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Yeah, just a quick one I also in my notes I noticed that I was a little confused but where in the subdivision code it discusses double frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6132)|
| 1:42:24| Let me see now I've got here in condition, seven talks about if a lot is less than 150 feet deep and it's double frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6144)|
| 1:42:39| I think there's common area, but then in the Innsbruck one that lot depth is less than 135 feet to have the common area or the setbacks and I were in the subdivision code does it kind of identify this regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6159)|
| 1:43:02| It's in the lot standard section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| Yeah, 3.02, a, a four 3.02 a four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6189)|
| 1:43:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| Yes. And so, if a property if a lot is along a classified road that's when it's 150 feet, if it's not along classified road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6205)|
| 1:43:35| So it's the local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| The depth is 135 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Okay, great. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| We'll move on to our number 23 sb 21 see this is Innsbruck farm you all received a lot of comments about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6228)|
| 1:43:56| The community had their first meeting last Friday's is what we, we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| And obviously expressed a lot of concerns that you all probably read about in your emails we understand that a representative of the community will be asking for postponement at the meeting if they haven't already sent in a letter but they will be attending the meeting, requesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6242)|
| 1:44:17| I'll let my ticket from here and give you a brief overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6257)|
| 1:44:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| So, if you're not familiar with the location of this property is on Ruggles Ferry bike, which you can see that runs through the middle of the screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6262)|
| 1:44:31| The large RA property to the south of the proposed subdivision is the Ruggles Ferry Golf Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6271)|
| 1:44:40| The Carter community is down here in this little node at Asheville highway and Andrew Johnson highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6280)|
| 1:44:51| You know, Ruggles Ferry is, you know, for a county road is a pretty, pretty good road is two lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6291)|
| 1:44:58| As center striping and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| The big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| There's two, two major issues that the community has expressed and you know one is lot size and a number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6306)|
| 1:45:13| You know how is that compatible with the, with the more rural community. They've got out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6313)|
| 1:45:20| The other being transportation issues, and the concern with Ruggles Ferry, but also some of the side streets that lead back to Asheville highway, such as like cash road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6320)|
| 1:45:37| It comes down to the highway. So, it's a kind of a twofold issue there, you know, Ruggles Ferry itself is, is a pretty good road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6337)|
| 1:45:46| But once you get off of Ruggles Ferry and start using the side streets, those will get busier, as well as the intersections at Andrew, Andrew Johnson highway and Asheville highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6346)|
| 1:45:59| The Andrew Johnson highway intersection with Ruggles Ferry, that's a county intersection, as well as a facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6359)|
| 1:46:11| And then the Asheville highway intersection is in the city limits of Knoxville so and also a facility. So we've got a couple issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6371)|
| 1:46:22| Both, both the county and the city have said they're not interested at this point in installing traffic traffic flights which the traffic impact study had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6382)|
| 1:46:36| has recommended as being needed these I guess the traffic study says it's warranted at these at these two intersections, both the county and the city so they'd rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6396)|
| 1:46:49| Once the development is up and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| If it's somebody gets approved, you know, study the, the traffic at those intersections and wait until it actually is warranted before they would like to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6412)|
| 1:47:05| So, I briefly just mentioned that the Ruggles Ferry properties across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6425)|
| 1:47:12| The golf course. I'm sorry, golf courses across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| The golf course and the subject property were rezoned at the same time in 1988 as a golf course and residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6437)|
| 1:47:25| And then in 1999, the golf course and some of the lots around the outside of the golf course were were approved and developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6445)|
| 1:47:35| Obviously this larger portion the RA, we're dealing with now for the Innsbruck Farms subdivision was never developed, but was intended to be a residential component to the larger course development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6455)|
| 1:47:51| It does have two access points and we turn on the plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| Has two access points to Ruggles Ferry. The main one being this boulevard entrance kind of centered in the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6476)|
| 1:48:04| The, the, the second one, more of a secondary entrance is off Lake Lane, which is an existing road it's very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6484)|
| 1:48:12| It's substandard it's about 12 to 13 feet wide now will need to be widened to 20 to a minimum of 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6492)|
| 1:48:21| From their proposed connector on road queue back to Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6501)|
| 1:48:28| There shouldn't be any issue with site distance, according to the traffic study at these two access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6508)|
| 1:48:34| It also does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| It also states that turn lanes on Ruggles Ferry are not warranted at those intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| There might need to be some restriping of passing lanes that are currently on North Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| So, just from a safety standpoint as you get closer to an intersection that that'll be, I guess, evaluated further by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6530)|
| 1:48:59| The project does also have to stub out roads, one on road B that would go to the property to the west and one on road are that would go to the property to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6539)|
| 1:49:09| And technically, that's the same property could connect into what is the remnant of Blake Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6549)|
| 1:49:17| As north of the road you intersection, a small portion of Blake Lane also need to be closed within the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6557)|
| 1:49:25| That'll be done after as a separate process through county commission doesn't have to be approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6565)|
| 1:49:35| There's 482 lots, a little over 200 acres. It's about 2.4 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6575)|
| 1:49:43| And it does have one small amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| It's kind of a shared amenity. I'd say too many, but this is where their mail facility would be and they also call a bark bark dog or dogs obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6586)|
| 1:49:59| Most of the other open spaces in the, in the subdivision are related to detention ponds or buffers, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6599)|
| 1:50:10| Does have frontage on on the whole river as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| I'll leave it there. If anybody has any questions I'll be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6614)|
| 1:50:23| Yes, I am dismayed that this large development proposal does not show any community enjoyment of the Holston River shoreline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6623)|
| 1:50:39| And I again wonder if the open space requirement can't be applied to having a shoreline easement or a kayak park that could be donated to legacy parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6639)|
| 1:50:54| I see that as a is one of the major flaws in this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| Is there any way within our jurisdiction as a planning commission to look at requiring that form of open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6659)|
| 1:51:12| I think it'd have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| It'd be preferable to be tied to some kind of plan document that shows how this open space would be part of the full system of the park system I obviously you're alluding it to be more of a kind of a quasi public, where if it's the land preservation organization and rather than the county parks department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6675)|
| 1:51:41| But I think it'd be better to be, you know, part of a plan document that we could say, you know, this was adopted where these properties in this area we're looking to have some kind of coordinated park use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6701)|
| 1:51:56| But I don't know if Amy or Steve anybody else has a thought on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6716)|
| 1:52:05| Legacy parks has expressed a view in the past that they do not want to be injected into development plans without their prior permission and approval and they were they were discomforted at some point in the past that their name has been bandied about by developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6725)|
| 1:52:23| and we're going to get with legacy parks, this, that, and the other and there's been no discussion so they have asked to be insulated from that in the course you couldn't mean they are just a free standing entity and would have no obligation to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6743)|
| 1:52:39| The base question could be have the authority to acquire open space. Yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6759)|
| 1:52:44| But tying it somehow to legacy parks would not be a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6764)|
| 1:52:51| At least not with their prior participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6771)|
| 1:52:57| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| Yeah, we've obviously gotten a lot of emails on this one, and, you know, several things about traffic and drainage and potential wetlands and things of that nature and I think there was a little bit of information in there about trying to reach out to the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6783)|
| 1:53:25| and that sort of thing so just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| You guys may have already touched on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| Mike may have been but just a little recap again on the traffic study and from staff level and, and anything that you kind of like to relay as far as the communication with the, with the residents, and then, am I seeing this right this thing's getting developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6810)|
| 1:53:51| So we're, we're not in a planned residential zone right we're just straight zoning and, and it's just cutting up the lots that are allowed in the Arizona right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6831)|
| 1:54:00| That's correct it is an Arizona.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| You know, in regard to what's been related to the community out there. I, I did not participate in the public meetings that were this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6845)|
| 1:54:19| And I've talked to several community members and and provided information to them, whether it be the development plan or the transportation, transportation impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6859)|
| 1:54:32| Once I provide information I didn't really get direct communications back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| It's anything that is substantive other than just some basic questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| So, that's, that's kind of where my participation in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| Yeah, I guess my broader question is did the county engineering department, give you any specific feedback from their review of the traffic impact study there that they concurred with whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6892)|
| 1:55:04| Yeah, yeah so that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| They want to defer to them, we could as well, if they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6908)|
| 1:55:14| Jim is on or representative from EPW.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| Hey, Chris, this Jim snow. We, we did look at the study pretty carefully. Obviously this number of watch you would normally anticipate some offside improvement but due to the existing traffic or lack thereof on Ruggles Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6919)|
| 1:55:34| It did not meet any necessarily requirements for an offside turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| We did look and speak with the state about both intersections of Ruggles Ferry and Asheville highway and Andrew Johnson highway, and they recommended no improvements either so we were we're comfortable with the recommendations contained within the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6940)|
| 1:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| Yeah, I think it did I mean I, you know, it's tough to deal with a large large piece of property just because, you know, it just, it gets penalized sometimes we're being so big and just, it's just hard to control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6966)|
| 1:56:22| If it's meeting the RA zone and and meet the locker requirements and meeting the sub regs, and you've gone through the traffic study I mean I'm trying to figure out ways that in a straight zone that you can apply a little more pressure for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=6982)|
| 1:56:41| out there I'm just in listening Mr. Snowden I'm not sure that there's a whole lot of options there it's like, you know, if you got a kid that's real tall and you're in your in your son's trying to play play sports against this kid that's three heads higher just because he happens to be a big kid you can't penalize the kid not let him play on your, on your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7001)|
| 1:57:05| It just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| This is a tough one for me because I've certainly gotten a lot of feedback and just trying to look for ways to make sure we're being thorough here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7027)|
| 1:57:22| I just wanted to, I think I maybe alluded to this early on to go to the traffic study but the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| We asked the engineer to basically force all the traffic generated from this subdivision onto rebels ferry only and not go on the side streets so he didn't, so they didn't really evaluate the side streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7049)|
| 1:57:45| The big thing was to see how, basically how if this development. If everybody went to rebels area went to Andrew Johnson highway intersection and over to Asheville highway intersection, you know, how would those two intersections handle that traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7065)|
| 1:58:00| Yes, I wanted to thank Mr wise for his comments about legacy parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7080)|
| 1:58:26| You know, their take on this, and for future developments I think that was really important to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7106)|
| 1:58:35| And really, I'm probably having the same struggle that Commissioner is having, because all of the comments that we have received and there have been quite a large number seem to emanate from the size of this the density of this development, and I'm just wondering what options exist for us as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7115)|
| 1:58:57| In relation to those community comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| Let me weigh in here that this isn't a zone unplanned zone as Mr. Mr pointed out, but it also is subject if which takes it out of a development plan, kind of control that you think of ordinarily in a plan zone you could impose conditions, but it's also a subdivision, and you have the same rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7142)|
| 1:59:29| In fact, greater rights in review of a subdivision plan to impose conditions, relative to amenities and the like, as you have been struggling over on plan zones or the zones that aren't planned and don't have sufficient language adequate to it but you have more latitude on the review and approval of a concept plan than you do on any other application that is presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7169)|
| 1:59:58| In terms of making something compatible with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| The, the language and the statute and the language and the ordinance itself refers to harmonious development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7202)|
| 2:00:10| And that can include the requirement for completion of amenities, it can limit the amount of density notwithstanding the fact someone has a density right either by some sort of zone where there's a maximum density established or if it's a zone where it's where there's the zone, the density established within the body zone itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7210)|
| 2:00:32| That's just merely an opportunity to ask subdivision proposal to be approved needs to be something that is compatible with the community or harmonious is the word that is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7232)|
| 2:00:43| And in keeping with the betterment of the, of the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| And one of the, one of the things can be implied is the amount of density that it is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7249)|
| 2:00:56| There's a whole multitude of powers that you have set forth in the body of the of your subdivision regulations requiring adequate open space coordination of roads harmonious development transportation considerations and of course the traffic study is addressing those avoiding population congestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7256)|
| 2:01:14| things are set forth in the code, but they've also been adopted in the predatory language or in the, in the preface to the minimum subdivision regulations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7274)|
| 2:01:26| So you have your exercising judicial quasi judicial authority, making judgments upon what is in the best interest of the community as a whole, which allows you the latitude to seek out and impose conditions to make these things harmonious with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7286)|
| 2:01:46| In fact, you're, you have more latitude here than in virtually any other exercise that you go through as a plan commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7306)|
| 2:01:57| So, can you help me understand, because that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| Yet I want to be understanding of when one crosses over into can well this isn't a zone, I was going to say conditional zoning that this isn't a zone, this is this, the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7322)|
| 2:02:18| Yes, that's not conditional zoning. So we do have the ability to, as you said, look for ways that this can be as harmonious as possible with the surrounding sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7338)|
| 2:02:36| Right. The subdivision regulations are minimum. So, they're called the minimum subdivision regulations, and there's specific language in there that gives the mission the ability to impose any, any, it's unlimited, you can impose conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7356)|
| 2:02:52| They're not defined or limited in any way it just there's a separate paragraph that acknowledges that these are the very bare minimum. And of course it makes sense that if you know the subdivision restrictions the way they're printed up they're mostly dimensional and density related they're all numbers which staff can run and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7372)|
| 2:03:14| And if you in somebody submits an application that meets the minimum, there would be no role for the planning commission to play the staff can figure out whether or not they've made the minimums and they can prove it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7394)|
| 2:03:25| So there's something more is anticipated by the statute, and by the, the subdivision regulation you're supposed to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7405)|
| 2:03:32| You're supposed to take these minimum of pro applications are making sure they hit the minimum and staff that's their burden to make sure that they won't give it to you unless they hit the minimums and you're then the burden upon you is to listen to public input, which again is required by the, the resolution the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7412)|
| 2:03:50| and consider the recommendations, and then do what's necessary to to massage applications to make them make the development harmonious, and there is no, there's some sort of some limit some types of conditioning that is set forth with suggestions in the body of the subdivision regulations and others are just there's a say there's no limit on it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7430)|
| 2:04:21| the overriding thing you're supposed to do what's best for the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7461)|
| 2:04:26| One thing that's specifically not included is in something that's has cropped up in the past is developments on subdivision myself, they will suggested to you that that we need to have certain density in this subdivision, otherwise it doesn't economically work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7466)|
| 2:04:45| And that is an utterly inappropriate criteria for assessment, the, what the courts have held is that the implications financial or economic to any one individual, or to any neighborhood is not an appropriate criteria rather you're trying to figure out whether the proposed development is harmonious and whether it's in the best interest of the community as a large and at large, not the economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7485)|
| 2:05:16| That was incredibly helpful. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7516)|
| 2:05:24| Commissioner Corbett like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| Yes, I, the process that I'm going to bring forward for discussion Thursday, regarding this application would be to hold the hearing and the deliberations, and then postpone it for a period of time so we can really stop and think and consider, and then actually return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7527)|
| 2:05:49| to the decision, either 30 days or 60 days. Is that a process that can be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7549)|
| 2:06:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| Thank you, Commissioner graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| Looking at the application, and the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7569)|
| 2:06:14| He's asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7574)|
| 2:06:17| Didn't it say 2.4 per unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| Is that right, that's, that's correct it's what average is out to an RA zone, he could get about 3.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7583)|
| 2:06:34| By right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| And when we talk about what should he give a what amenities and that sort of thing. And what conditions should we impose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7597)|
| 2:06:49| He's already giving quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| To begin with, he could be asking for more than 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| You're going to be asking for 150 more locks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| So, I think maybe we ought to keep that in mind when we discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7622)|
| 2:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7629)|
| 2:07:16| Thank you Commissioner graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| Any other question or comment, Commissioner public, or move on. Yes, Commissioner graph said by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7639)|
| 2:07:26| And I'm not sure that is entirely correct I was going to ask Mr wise, given that he needs to go through a subjective hearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7646)|
| 2:07:36| It's not by right it's not permitted the density is part of what our subjective decision is, isn't that correct Mr wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7656)|
| 2:07:47| What he has a right to do is ask up to a certain level you don't have a right to obtain the density either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7667)|
| 2:07:54| Having been set by playing commissions are resounding or established by the zoning ordinance is merely a limit to which the request can come but if there's a subdivision involved and burden is upon planning commission to determine what is the appropriate density in order to be harmonious with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7674)|
| 2:08:16| Thank you Mr wise Commissioner off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| I'm gonna make a comment and then I'm going to have to bail up in another meeting here in about 10 minutes I will do a little preparation for but when you talk about what's nice and what's appropriate and what's what looks good to one person what looks good to the other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7702)|
| 2:08:41| We'd have 15 different opinions of what that might be on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7721)|
| 2:08:46| And I think, considering Commissioner grass comments, he could have asked for 1.2 more units per acre, but they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7726)|
| 2:08:59| They could also, they could ask for 1.2 more units per acre and say okay we need that additional density if we're going to be required to do some other other parts of the property for various reasons that individual commissioners might think are nicer, or that should be or shouldn't be included in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7739)|
| 2:09:22| And I think we ought to keep that in mind. I think we also, you know, I think we get caught up a lot in talking about developers and talking about how we need to hold developers responsible or to a higher standard, so to speak, and each one of these things that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7762)|
| 2:09:40| But I think a lot of times we forget to look at the actual property owners, and, and what they want to do with their property and what they have a right to do with their property, based on the zones that we set forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7780)|
| 2:09:54| And I just think we need to consider the people that own the owners of the property and and what their rights, if you will, under our laws, under our property right laws are before we try to hold these people hostage, if you will, to whatever we think is nice and pretty between each one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7794)|
| 2:10:24| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| Thank you, Commissioner, I might suggest, given the time it's 142, we know that we'll probably have some additional discussion about this item on Thursday if it's okay with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7827)|
| 2:10:36| I know there's some folks who have been dropping off to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| We have a couple more agenda items, could we, is there one okay if we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7839)|
| 2:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| He has two more agenda items, and he wanted to touch on number 24 is bluegrass subdivision is the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7849)|
| 2:10:57| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| This will be real quick I just want to, like Amy said it's touching a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7859)|
| 2:11:06| familiar bluegrass elementary school is this off to the east, and then Ebenezer road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7866)|
| 2:11:13| Just, you know, just not too far away from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7873)|
| 2:11:19| We've gotten some, some comments about this, but bluegrass road in particular that the road is residents out there feel it's not really safe to have some dips have some curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7879)|
| 2:11:32| So people who use it every day have concerns with the road, which I would say that is very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7892)|
| 2:11:40| This, this property is pretty close to Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| So, and it's appears to have site distance that bluegrass for the new road that doesn't appear to be an issue there that could be evaluated further during permitting but that's does not appear to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7904)|
| 2:11:59| Other other item is that this storm stormwater related that there is some flooding in this area county insurance familiar with it. It's been documented there's a sinkhole in this area that this that this property drains to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7919)|
| 2:12:13| And because of these issues, they'll be required to do retention on the site instead of detention which is a higher standard for stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7933)|
| 2:12:23| And a neighboring property owner mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7943)|
| 2:12:26| There's some water that drains from the neighborhood to the north through this property that will need to be picked up and then easement and and so on it's not shown on the concept plan but it's typically handled during the, during the permitting phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7946)|
| 2:12:43| One other quick, quick item me flip over to the plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| The applicant is requesting a purple setback reduction on lots nine through 1135 to 25 feet, and the same down here at 30, 34 and 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7968)|
| 2:13:01| I'm, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| My recommendation is to basically deny those, I'm not recommending approval of those two reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7984)|
| 2:13:12| So, my recommendation is to require the 35 feet for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| For those lots. There is a separate reduction request that I am recommending approval of the 25 foot peripheral for lots one through three, and then a 20 foot peripheral on lot one which is kind of like a side setback over to bluegrass road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=7997)|
| 2:13:34| There's a driveway that is behind these lots that provides an extra 25 feet or so to the next adjacent neighborhood to the east. So, not really sure a 35 foot peripheral is really going to be provide anything of extra protection against adjacent property owners I think the 25 foot purple there is, is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8014)|
| 2:13:58| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8038)|
| 2:14:05| Questions on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8045)|
| 2:14:07| See no hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| Thank you Mike if you want to go on to item number 31 which is one day 21 issue it's acre Kingston Pike we briefly discussed this one earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8049)|
| 2:14:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| Recently, by council to go from CG to CG three to down to CG one I can't remember whether it was CG three down to CG one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8061)|
| 2:14:32| The big, big thing on that it takes away the built to zone, and there's also some building standards and design standards are not going to have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8072)|
| 2:14:40| But for them really the built to zone was the thing that that really hurt them, because they would have to build the buildings closer to the road staff is recommending postponement on this, there's still some issues they have not addressed in their traffic impact letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8080)|
| 2:14:57| So they have to do a full study but we were asking them for certain things to be evaluated as part of a traffic impact letter outline outline some of those in the staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8097)|
| 2:15:08| But you can see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8108)|
| 2:15:10| They've got two different uses they have a take five oil change and they also have the scooters copy. Both of these uses are require special use approval by the Planning Commission, so they're not permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8110)|
| 2:15:23| But what you what you also see is there is a lot of space dedicated to the movement of cars in this very tight site, which creates some very awkward situations and this is something that staff was really concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8123)|
| 2:15:37| Especially because we have the Kingston Pike frontage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| If you look at their exit to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| So, one, what they're showing in this queue for the drive through lane. These are about as big of a passenger car, probably a large SUV or truck, but big of a vehicle that you would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8146)|
| 2:15:58| That's just a standard vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| It's about 22 feet long if you show that here stacked at this exit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8161)|
| 2:16:06| Somebody sitting there if somebody's pulling off for Kingston Pike and wanting to go over here to the oil change. They can't get past that car granted again, this is about as big of a vehicle you're going to find for for just a passenger or regular non commercial vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8166)|
| 2:16:23| So, it doesn't take much for one car to then block that that entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8183)|
| 2:16:30| They're queuing space for the scooters appears to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8190)|
| 2:16:37| And to take five oil change, you'd have cars that are would pull in and wait and then for their time to pull it, you know, get their oil change and then they pull through the building to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8197)|
| 2:16:47| Even then it's you. For instance, this, this vehicle turning left here with a parked car here gets kind of dicey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8207)|
| 2:16:57| I think they could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| But they're, they haven't shown any, any turn templates to see exactly how cars would maneuver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| You have also be able to carve turning are coming out of the scooters drive through and wanted to turn right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8224)|
| 2:17:14| I think they should probably be making some kind of multi point turn to come back around to the Winston Road in the traffic letter, the engineer mentioned that if somebody wants to get over to Winston Road, and there are scooters that could turn right onto Kingston Pike and then right onto Winston Road, which is, which is true, they could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8234)|
| 2:17:32| Do you have markings that say, yeah, you're, you're not supposed to turn right, especially say turn left only, but it's human nature that somebody wants to turn right they're going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8252)|
| 2:17:41| It's just that the site is it's very, very tight. And the staff is would still like to see the, some of the issues addressed that were not addressed in the traffic impact letter that we were requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8261)|
| 2:17:55| Another, another item was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8275)|
| 2:17:59| Yeah, so across the shopping center across Kingston Pike has the Barnes and Noble and Trader Joe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8279)|
| 2:18:07| And the access to this site would be would be here if somebody is turning left onto Kingston Pike, and someone's turning left out of this shopping center they're going to be in some conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8287)|
| 2:18:19| That's not uncommon on Kingston Pike and some of these other larger corridors, but we just want to see what what kind of issues we're going to run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8299)|
| 2:18:28| So, that's the reason why we're asking for the post moment we feel that there's still needs a little more fleshing out of the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8308)|
| 2:18:38| I think I'm wrong but they're also possibly asking for a deviation from landscape requirements is that, and that's still being worked out as well. That correct, or will be a deviation from the standard alternative landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8318)|
| 2:18:55| Sorry, wrong plan. I don't recall, they're going to have to or not, because their lives so small that they're going to, they don't have to meet all the landscaping sanitary of a parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8335)|
| 2:19:08| But they, they might need to along the outer edge maybe of their other side they do show a six foot landscaping set area though which justifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8348)|
| 2:19:22| Thank you, Commissioner Adams. Yes, my. This is really helpful to see their movement plan, and you're right it's super tight you kind of, it's like a, everything has to go right to make it all work but where the parking, it seems like the cars are all in movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8362)|
| 2:19:44| Okay, so so scooters doesn't have their drive through facility only so that they, they need to have three parking spaces by the parking regulations, but there will be really only for the employees of their other coffee shop so they have to right in front, which, you know, and then they also have one here in the drive through lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8384)|
| 2:20:05| So they would want to see a high turnover parking space, be located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8405)|
| 2:20:11| But if it's an employee, you know, a little less concern there they're not going to have people parking and then getting coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210309-agenda-review?start=8411)|
