| 2:44:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9862)|
| 2:44:22| Moving it from 10.9 to 12.5, and that's what makes the project doable versus not doable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9862)|
| 2:44:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| I just thought that was important to kind of clarify how that works a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9874)|
| 2:44:41| A couple of questions that I had for Ms. Welch when we spoke about this earlier, I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9881)|
| 2:44:48| familiar with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9888)|
| 2:44:49| My kids went to school next door and no longer because of many of the challenges of student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9889)|
| 2:44:56| parking, housing, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| And I actually saw the houses torn down, which has nothing to do with the current development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9900)|
| 2:45:08| at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| The houses where it's going to go were torn down a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9910)|
| 2:45:16| So, there's several businesses that are there currently, the Subways, the Jasons, the Dominos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9916)|
| 2:45:23| the bookstore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| You have a three-year build-out phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| What happens with those during the build-out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9927)|
| 2:45:30| That's a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| So, the Jasons and Subway will come back into the ground floor of our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9933)|
| 2:45:40| We've executed conditional leases for them to come back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9940)|
| 2:45:48| Temporarily, both Jasons and Subway will relocate to other facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9948)|
| 2:45:56| So, they're not having to go out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9956)|
| 2:45:58| They're just temporarily relocating and then they'll come back in into what they're telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9958)|
| 2:46:02| us is a much improved layout of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9962)|
| 2:46:08| Dominos will go to another location and stay in that other location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| It didn't make sense for them to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| They said, well, if we're going to move, we'd rather just move once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9974)|
| 2:46:21| So, they'll still be operating in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9981)|
| 2:46:26| Hookah Hookup is actually going to not be a part of our project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9986)|
| 2:46:33| So, they're on a month-to-month lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| And they're still kind of to be determined on whether they want to relocate somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=9996)|
| 2:46:44| But we won't have space for them in our final project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10004)|
| 2:46:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10010)|
| 2:46:51| And to clarify, the current tax rate that's paid will be paid during the three-year construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10011)|
| 2:46:59| base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10019)|
| 2:47:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10021)|
| 2:47:01| Yes, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10021)|
| 2:47:02| Nothing changes about that during the construction base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10028)|
| 2:47:09| And then for six and a half subsequent years, assuming that the number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10029)|
| 2:47:16| how does the number of units apply to the pilot in terms of, you know, the project says it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10036)|
| 2:47:23| going to have a certain number of units, a certain number of parking spaces, a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| number of bicycle parking spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| So, can this be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| The abatement is really based on the projected tax assessed value of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10053)|
| 2:47:40| If the property isn't built out as described in Graystar's proposal, then first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10060)|
| 2:47:50| I would assume that that would affect their return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10070)|
| 2:47:53| But it also would affect the appraised value of the property at the end when they receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10073)|
| 2:47:59| their certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10079)|
| 2:48:01| And the pilot just therefore wouldn't be worth as much, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10081)|
| 2:48:07| So, right now, based on the projected investment and the number of beds and, you know, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10087)|
| 2:48:14| of the improvements that Graystar is making to this property, I think you made a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10094)|
| 2:48:18| good point earlier, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| And I just want to really sort of drive this home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| Right now, on this property, the current property taxes are almost $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10104)|
| 2:48:33| That's city and county combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10113)|
| 2:48:36| That amount will not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10116)|
| 2:48:38| That payment will be the same amount as the current taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| So, there's no outlay of funding from the city or from the county, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10121)|
| 2:48:47| At the end of the pilot period, the projected value, and this is going to be based on an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10127)|
| 2:48:56| assessment that will be done when the project is complete, but we're projecting, based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10136)|
| 2:49:02| what they've turned in, the property taxes will increase 20-fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10142)|
| 2:49:08| So, just that will be a $1.5 million tax bill that Graystar will receive, and those dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10148)|
| 2:49:19| in six and a half years after construction will then start coming to the city and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10159)|
| 2:49:25| county in that 20-fold increased amount with no outlay from the city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10165)|
| 2:49:35| Just if I could interrupt just to do the calculations for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10175)|
| 2:49:41| That goes from an annual tax revenue of $70,000 to an annual tax revenue of $1.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10181)|
| 2:49:52| in just six and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10192)|
| 2:49:54| Right, about $1.5 million, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10194)|
| 2:49:56| $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10196)|
| 2:49:57| Yeah, a little bit more than 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10197)|
| 2:49:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10199)|
| 2:50:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10200)|
| 2:50:01| Oh, Ms. Ryder, Ms. Hesseman has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10201)|
| 2:50:04| She hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10204)|
| 2:50:05| Yeah, two quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| You have no intention of asking for any variances for the project, or you don't know that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10208)|
| 2:50:15| We have no major variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10215)|
| 2:50:17| We recently received two very minor technical variances at last week's BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10217)|
| 2:50:25| Okay, but not variances on parking, bicycle spaces required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10225)|
| 2:50:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| In the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10231)|
| 2:50:32| Right, we were very careful to keep everything intact and, you know, push for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10232)|
| 2:50:37| And all the parking is private to your establishment, or is there some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10237)|
| 2:50:41| element of public parking for those commercial spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10241)|
| 2:50:44| It's all, it'll all be owned by the entity that owns the, you know, the greater building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10244)|
| 2:50:52| And 40 spaces will be available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10252)|
| 2:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10256)|
| 2:50:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10258)|
| 2:50:59| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10259)|
| 2:51:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10263)|
| 2:51:04| I just want to say, first of all, to Graystar, thank you for coming to Knoxville, and thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10264)|
| 2:51:11| for, you know, investing and infusing, you know, a great deal of money in this area, in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10271)|
| 2:51:21| You know, we all, I think for all of us, affordable housing is certainly top of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10281)|
| 2:51:26| It is a critical need in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10286)|
| 2:51:28| But I also believe that we can't be one dimensional in our approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10288)|
| 2:51:32| I mean, we have other needs, and we have other gaps to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10292)|
| 2:51:35| I think having this housing on campus, I mean, we know that enrollment's going up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| that UT doesn't have the ability or the land to, you know, build their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10301)|
| 2:51:47| And, you know, but it also keeps the walkability for students to campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10307)|
| 2:51:52| the accessibility, I think there are a lot of bonuses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| But, you know, I get we have to be judicious about issuing pilots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10316)|
| 2:52:02| but we also have to make it easier, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| Ninety-one million dollars to come to this community is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| I've said, you know, for a very long time, we've got to expand our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10329)|
| 2:52:13| And, you know, to have $800,000 or nearly $800,000 more increasing a tax base in a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10333)|
| 2:52:22| short period of time really only gives us that much more revenue to then, in turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10342)|
| 2:52:28| infuse into more affordable housing, social services that we need in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10348)|
| 2:52:32| So I can only hope that we have more investors like Graystar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10352)|
| 2:52:37| They're looking at Knoxville to come in and infuse this kind of money and to build our city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10357)|
| 2:52:44| to create, you know, economic vibrance across Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| So I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| And, you know, it's an enormous investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10371)|
| 2:52:54| And I'm sorry if you've been met by a lot of challenges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10374)|

| 2:53:22| No, that's a good question, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10402)|
| 2:53:24| The county does not need to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| I will say just in the spirit of cooperation, I made sure to touch base with their finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10406)|
| 2:53:33| director, the county mayor weighed in on this because we know that it will, you know, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10413)|
| 2:53:40| also an investment in Knox County as we are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10420)|

| 2:53:53| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10433)|
| 2:53:54| Does this also impact their county taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10434)|
| 2:53:59| Yeah, every single body, every single property in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| pays Knox County property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10443)|
| 2:54:05| The ones that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| No, I just mean the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10447)|
| 2:54:09| When we, will the county come under this pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10449)|
| 2:54:16| Yes, Council Member Parker, you know, again, a good question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10456)|
| 2:54:20| So the pilot affects both city and county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10465)|
| 2:54:26| And you only have to give the county heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| They don't have to be a part of the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10468)|
| 2:54:30| If it's more than 10 years, they, the county has to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| That is the way the state law works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| So this is under 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10477)|
| 2:54:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10480)|
| 2:54:41| For me, I appreciate this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10481)|
| 2:54:45| I have struggled with it because I have real concern about these apartment complexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| And I would like for us as a city, you know, to not just get excited when we see big numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| on a page, but to really think about the impact that these housing complexes can have on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10496)|
| 2:55:03| community long term and think about who's going to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| Rich people have to have somewhere to live too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10506)|
| 2:55:08| So I'm okay with development that is just for rich people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10508)|
| 2:55:13| But let's acknowledge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10513)|
| 2:55:14| You know, let's not have false conversations about affordability because I think it's frustrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10514)|
| 2:55:22| for me and it's frustrating for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10522)|
| 2:55:25| If this is about expanding our tax base, let's be honest about it and talk about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10525)|
| 2:55:31| that being the goal of this project in terms of, you know, providing more affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10531)|
| 2:55:38| for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| I don't think that meets the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| I haven't been convinced of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| Will it bring in a lot of extra tax dollars in six and a half years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10544)|
| 2:55:48| It appears so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10548)|
| 2:55:49| But I just wanted to clarify that point and encourage us to look into these types of developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10549)|
| 2:55:57| more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10557)|
| 2:55:59| And their long-term impacts on college towns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10559)|
| 2:56:01| I just wanted to comment that that raises another good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10561)|
| 2:56:05| When we do get that extra $1.5 million above what we're currently getting, that can be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10565)|
| 2:56:12| more affordable housing projects, for our affordable rental development fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10572)|
| 2:56:16| It can be used to address needs in the homeless community, to invest in workforce development so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10576)|
| 2:56:22| people can earn, improve their skills, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10582)|
| 2:56:26| There's two sides of the affordable housing equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| One is the cost of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| One is people's incomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| A huge part and challenge of our affordable housing challenges is that people's incomes are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| really low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| So this is a project that will increase the tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| We're being totally transparent and open about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| We've said this isn't affordable, but it does increase supply, which addresses affordability in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10602)|
| 2:56:46| a macroeconomic sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| And I think it's a worthwhile investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| I wouldn't have put it on your agenda for your consideration if I didn't think it was worthwhile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| to the people of this city in the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| And I would appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| May I add one more comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| I think one of the things that was important for me was that we were able to get a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10626)|

| 2:57:17| I think one of the things that was important for me is the built-in parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| That's another reason that makes this project so hard from a design and development and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10639)|

| 2:57:33| And so I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Cumberland Avenue, Buckeye, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10653)|

| 2:58:27| If you know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| You may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| You know, it really varies by market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10711)|

| 2:58:35| There are those anomalies where, you know, you might have a market that, you know, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200922_202102?start=10715)|
