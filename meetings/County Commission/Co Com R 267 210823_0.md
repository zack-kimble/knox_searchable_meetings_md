| 0:11:11| Anniversary of the FIRST Annual Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| on Global Content and Additional論| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| Political Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| There was a poll done, a national poll done after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=678)|
| 0:11:24| 2016 election on the state of our families after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| And it showed that there were one in six families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| another family member because of all of the conflict and turmoil over the 2016 election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=694)|
| 0:11:44| I haven't seen any numbers for polling that's been done since the 2020 election, but I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| imagine that it's probably not better and it may even be worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| So this conflict and internal, not only within our nation, has also hit our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| It's very close and it's very personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| I do see that conflict in politics, of course, is nothing new in our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=728)|
| 0:12:16| I mean, we were developed on conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| One thing that I had read here of some interest is one of our early presidents, Andrew Jackson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=740)|
| 0:12:29| was asked on his deathbed if he had any regrets, anything that he would have done differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=749)|
| 0:12:36| decisions he would have made, changes that he would have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| And the congressional record actually reports that his reply was, and as you know, he was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| referred to as Old Hickory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| He said that he regretted he hadn't shot Henry Clay, who was the Speaker of the House, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| hung John Calhoun, his own vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| And if you all have had a chance to see the Broadway play Hamilton, you will certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=781)|
| 0:13:08| recall in that that he was actually shot in a duel by Aaron Burr, who at that point in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| time was a sitting vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| So even though it's not new to us because our country has faced this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=798)|
| 0:13:27| I do think that we feel like it's very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| Again, it has just gotten to a personal level that has sometimes not brought out the best in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=811)|
| 0:13:42| We love our God, and we love our country, and we love freedom, and we love what freedom means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=822)|
| 0:13:53| We cannot even agree on what freedom is anymore in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| There is so much conflict over the definition of freedom and what it means from one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| to what it means from another person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| And sadly, when we go to the polls and we vote, especially when we vote as Christians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=851)|
| 0:14:21| sometimes the results are not what we hoped for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| And as our former governor put it so aptly, we are mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| We are mad, and we cannot believe that other people do not believe the way that we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=870)|
| 0:14:38| So this is kind of the state that we have revolved around to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=878)|
| 0:14:50| Every man and woman has the right and responsibility to bring their most deeply held beliefs to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| as Haslam states at the public square, where discourse, debate, and dialogue can flourish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| as Lincoln said, with malice toward none, with charity toward all, with firmness in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| the right as God gives us to see the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| And that is a quote, again, from Abraham Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=916)|
| 0:15:21| So how exactly do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| I am sometimes puzzled myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| I love the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| I love what he does in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| I love our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I love our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| And yet still, sometimes things just don't quite seem to gel the way that I wish that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=937)|
| 0:15:41| they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| I might suggest that through all this turmoil, we need to remember, as believers, that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| eyes belong on the Lord, not on the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| And we also need to remember, as believers, that we are serving the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| We are not serving a political party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| We're not serving an ideal, even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| We are serving the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| And keep in mind that it's not about our politics as we make decisions, and it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| about our pocketbook as we make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| And those are two things that have caused a lot of misguidance in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=984)|
| 0:16:35| I suggest on a personal level and here at the community level that we are, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=995)|
| 0:16:41| better than that, and we will continue to be better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| Just to end on a little bit lighter note here, I wanted to read just a brief story that our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| former governor included in his book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| He talks about standing up, stepping up, coming forth to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| And he writes, I had been in office as governor of Tennessee about two weeks when Max Haston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| the adjunct general of the Tennessee National Guard, asked me to attend the Guard's annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| meeting on a Saturday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| I arrived and was immediately taken to the holding room outside the main ballroom where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| the meeting was being held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Soon, a sergeant at arms came to escort me to the back of the ballroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| I was impressed by the sight before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| All of the men and women of the Tennessee Air and Army National Guard were in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| They were all in uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| They were seated with their units, and at the end of each row, there were flags that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| represented the battles that their units had fought in over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| It was just wonderful gala and pageantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| I was in the back of the room looking down the long aisle at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| I heard a deep voice come over the speaker and say, please welcome the commander in chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| of the Tennessee National Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Immediately every soldier stood at attention and they saluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| And he said, and I stood there, and he said, the sergeant of arms had to come over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| nudge me and say, sir, you have just been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| You are our commander in chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| He uses that as an example of what it truly does mean to step up, sometimes even when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| you don't even realize it's you that's being called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| It is my hope that people of faith realize that we are the ones to bring hope to a world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1119)|
| 0:18:46| that feels increasingly divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| We are the public servants, and people look to us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| When an entire nation is filled with contempt for the other side, perhaps we can model what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| Jeremiah was calling the Israelites to do in Babylon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| And this is a quote from Jeremiah 29, 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| In doing so, we can remind a wounded and weary nation that there is one who came to rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| us from a life without hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| If you all would bow your heads for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| Our heavenly father, thank you so much for giving each of us the privilege to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| to serve our communities, to serve at any level that we're called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| Lord, I would like to have a special prayer tonight for our brothers and sisters in Waverly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| We've seen how those devastating floods have cost not only loss of property and homes but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1186)|
| 0:19:53| loss of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Lord, and we pray tonight you'll be especially close to those families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| Lord, as we carry on our business tonight and each night, please keep your hand on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| and your guidance in our heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| We love you, Lord, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1208)|

| 0:21:11| Well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| Here is how I intend on conducting tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| First we'll set our agenda, then we have two honorary resolutions to vote on in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| After that, we have two presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| We do not have anyone signed up for public forum, so we will skip that item and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| jump into the rest of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I anticipate we will be done before 7 when zonings begin, but if not, as always, we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| take a break and then return to the agenda when that is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| I want to break down the additions, withdrawals, deferrals, and non-consent, then I will call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| on you, Commissioner Daley, after we set the agenda and begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| Our additions tonight include 31, 32, 44, and 45, 31, 32, 44, 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1321)|

| 0:22:24| We have quite a number of deferrals tonight, those include 35, 42, 54, and then 61 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=1344)|

| 0:35:30| We don't know if that will ever change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| The North Battalion continues to be the busiest overall with 633 emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2132)|

| 0:35:42| We don't understand some of these trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| Through the partnership with Knox County, we added two new educational videos to the YouTube library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| Had 49,305 views for the month, representing 3,625 contact hours of program time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| And logging 637,891 impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| That's got to be a record for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| And also added 138 new subscribers to the YouTube channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| In addition, I apologize for my phone ringing. I guess somebody needs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| We had 37 in-person events, 2,700 contact hours in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| So total contacts via all conduits was 52,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| Our membership percentages for the month of July have remained just around 47%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| Although we have started some pretty aggressive neighborhood visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| Showing off equipment to the kids and discussing the many benefits of supporting rural metro fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Thus keeping their taxes low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We are headed into the fall and we've all heard the COVID reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| And I'm sure you may hear some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| It has also affected the fire department in this second round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| We have had EMTs and paramedics who have contracted this latest round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| Have been forced to have them off from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| Which causes an extreme amount of stress on our system and our crew members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| That have been, to this point, successfully avoiding the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| Or in most cases, getting the vaccine, utilizing facial coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| And when warranted, keeping some distance from those who may or may not have been vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| We want to encourage all Knox County citizens to talk to their doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| Gain the necessary knowledge and make the appropriate decisions on their health outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| As always, know that we're here for you should you have any needs or any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| And I'll entertain any if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Doesn't look like there is. Thank you very much for the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| Have a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Mr. Odom from the Knoxville Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| If you would join us at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| And please state your name and your address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| Good evening. Mike Odom, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Mr. Chairman and Commissioners, glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| I'm going to go quickly because I have one minute left on my meter outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| I don't want the sheriff to give me a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I know he doesn't do tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| The last two months, we've had almost 560 new Knox County business licenses issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2290)|
| 0:38:18| That's a 7% increase over the same time period from pre-COVID two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2298)|
| 0:38:23| A year and a half, two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| So more people are starting businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| And what that means is typically the number one issue with new business people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| and small businesses is capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| Access to capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| So as part of Path to Prosperity, our strategic vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| one of the priorities was to develop a regional access to capital strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| which we did in partnership with a lot of organizations across the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| And it's called Capital Access Redefined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| We released that last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| So right now, we, as well as our partners out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| are trying to implement the recommendations for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| And if any of you have a chance to read it and have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| we'd be happy to answer those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| Economic development-wise, our project pipeline is as large as it's ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| There seems to be a lot of pent-up demand coming from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| We right now have 86 legitimate economic development projects we're working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| That equates to 13,000 jobs and about 1.6 billion in capital expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2362)|
| 0:39:30| And of that 68, 19 of those are business expansions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| So those are businesses here that we're trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| We've already made the commitment, made the investment in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| We want to help them grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Another priority of Path to Prosperity was a workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| regional workforce development strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| We did that earlier this year, called Workforce Redefined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| It is the number one issue of businesses still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| They just can't find workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| And so we're working very hard to help build that pipeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| We're working on internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Another problem is transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| So our team is working very diligently with groups like Ethro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| to see if we can do a pilot out to our employment centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| out in the county to get the people that can and are willing to work to those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| We also work concerned about talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| As we've talked about before, you know, that 25 to 54-year-old person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| professional that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| So we're implementing our Talent Redefined strategy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| The big thing for us is pretty soon we're going to launch some talent recruitment efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| in very targeted regions across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| So areas we think we can go and get people and bring them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| have them fall in love in the same way that all of you fall in love with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| A big part of that, though, is right now we're in the midst of a regional wage and benefit survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| to understand what in the post-COVID world, I guess not really post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| but what the wage and benefit landscape is of our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| That actually finishes on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=2462)|

| 0:58:32| THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE IT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=3512)|

| 1:34:21| I agree with Mr. Holbrook. I think the applicant does need further advice because it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| that there's a procedural issue here that there really should have been an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| for a sector plan amendment or was there? I would think the zoning being requested actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5670)|
| 1:34:39| needs a sector plan amendment, does it not? It does to go to CA, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| So I don't know if that was not done or it seems like maybe it wasn't. So I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| some procedural issues that need to be cleaned up. So I would move that we grant the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5691)|
| 1:34:58| requested by Mr. Holbrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| To what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| To a time certain of the September zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| So would you like to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| Yes, I did make the motion. But I want to qualify that by saying if we simply take this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5710)|
| 1:35:17| up as is, I'm not sure that we can even grant the appeal because there needs to be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| procedural issues cleaned up. There's got to be a sector plan amendment for this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| zoning. So I'll yield to the Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| Is there a second to that motion before we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| Mr. Daly, you had your light on first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| Yeah, just to, Amy, this is a planning, not BCA. BCA didn't have anything to do with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| That is correct. It came through the Planning Commission. I just wanted to double check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| as well to make sure that there wasn't the sector plan amendment that was considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| as well. The only thing that would come forward as appeal would be the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5752)|
| 1:35:56| Yeah, it's not BCA. It was all under planning, sir. So BCA did. I just wanted to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| that. BCA had nothing to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| Well, BCA declined at 11 zip. I mean, that's in the record. What I'm looking at is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5764)|
| 1:36:14| planning, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| It's the Knoxville-Knox County Planning who did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| BCA is the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| That's a nine-member board that meets on a Wednesday at 1.30, the last Wednesday of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| That can be cleared up, I think, after the fact. Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Will that be enough time to get it out? You said September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| I did, but I guess I would ask Ms. Brooks, how much time would they need in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| apply for a sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| I just want to clarify that they did apply for a sector plan amendment, and the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| plan amendment was denied, as well as the rezoning. The only thing that gets forwarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| to this body from Planning Commission is the rezoning. If you all were to overturn Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| Commission's recommendation, or denial, excuse me, then it would be sent back to Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| Commission for them to reconsider the sector plan amendment and the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| So would you like to keep your motion to defer it as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| Yes, I'll keep it the same. We can just take it up in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| For the motion on the floor, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| Is there a reason they put in notes on why it was denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| I apologize. Commissioner Ward, can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| What was the reason why it was denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| That it wasn't consistent with the sector plan. They considered the sector plan first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| prior to considering the rezoning, so they had that discussion first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| Is there any notes about why the sector plan was denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| Yes. So there were comments made to the adjacency to agriculturally zoned properties, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5874)|
| 1:38:01| as single family dwellings. The commission discussed with the applicants if they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| be interested in the neighborhood commercial. So there was quite a bit of discussion about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| that in terms of if, you know, there was, you know, comments about, I think maybe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5892)|
| 1:38:19| wasn't clear to the commission exactly what they had hoped to pursue with this rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| and plan amendment. But really, it just, it centered around the fact that it wasn't compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5903)|
| 1:38:30| with the existing development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Commissioner Bealy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Thank you, Chairman. I just wanted to, I was going to add to that, but I think Ms. Brooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| So currently the motion is just to defer for 30 days and hopefully that would give enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| time for proper legal counsel and maybe clear up the matter before it came back to us for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5928)|
| 1:38:53| a ruling. Is that understood by you? Do you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| No, Mr. Chairman. I have not followed this at all. I'm trying to understand whether Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| Brooks is saying that this particular zoning presently, she, I think, is indicating that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5942)|
| 1:39:11| it complies with the sector plan and it doesn't. Do you want to clarify that, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| I can try. So the current sector plan designation on this, I'm going to pull it up here, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5958)|
| 1:39:34| NC, Neighborhood Commercial. The current zoning on the property is Ag, Agricultural. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5974)|
| 1:39:42| are requesting to go to CA, which is a general commercial zone, which would require a sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5982)|
| 1:39:52| plan. I'm sorry, they're requesting to go to CA, general business, which would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=5992)|
| 1:40:01| the general commercial land use designation. I don't know if that helps clear it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| I've just got one simple question. What is the present zoning of this particular piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| of property? Agriculture. Okay, agriculture. What does the sector plan say? The sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| plan says Neighborhood Commercial. So we've got an agricultural zoning. We don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6022)|
| 1:40:30| a zoning that complies with the sector plan. And they've left these people just swirling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6030)|
| 1:40:40| around. Mr. Skinneker? Hold on a second. This is a clarifying statement. You can go. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6040)|
| 1:40:48| Thank you, Mr. Biggs. Sir, do you want to try this this evening, or do you want to delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6048)|
| 1:41:01| this for 30 days to help the applicant out? Because you sound like you want to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| with this case, but you said you're not prepared to. So we're trying to figure out what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6066)|
| 1:41:12| want to do here. Do you want a 30-day delay, or do you want to go ahead and hear this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| this evening? I don't think a 30-day delay. I don't know the procedures for amending the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6076)|
| 1:41:22| sector plan, but I don't think they can get it done in 30 days, can they? Mr. Wheeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6082)|
| 1:41:29| and Ms. Brooks, do you feel like 30 days is an adequate amount of time to revisit this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| The appeal that's before you is the appeal of Planning Commission's denial of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| You all need to act on that appeal, and if you choose to overturn that denial, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| would be sent back to Planning Commission for reconsideration of the sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| which is also denied, along with the rezoning. Commissioner Biggs? That's kind of why I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| wondering if we, I didn't want to waffle the ball or anything like that, just kind of making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| sure that if we did do that, that's the direction that it would take, so it would go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| then come back again. No, if you approve the 30-day delay, that would give more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| for the applicant to work with their attorney, and that's my understanding, is that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6132)|
| 1:42:19| may be going to switch attorneys, someone who has a land use specialty. You all still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| need to act on this appeal for the rezoning before it can be reconsidered by Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| Commission. Planning Commission has already considered the rezoning and the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| and have recommended denial. So, I'm going to try to summarize. Commissioner Smith? Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6153)|
| 1:42:43| you, Mr. Chair. Director Brooks, the applicant's attorney has stated the intended use for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6163)|
| 1:42:52| piece of property. That would not work under neighborhood commercial, would it? It depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6172)|
| 1:43:00| on what type of use it is. If it's for a contractor's office, which would include a contractor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| yard, then no, it wouldn't. If it's just a strict office use, then that can be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| under the neighborhood commercial. Okay, so the fact that he wants to have a small warehouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| would exclude him from being able to do this in neighborhood commercial? With the outdoor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6195)|
| 1:43:20| storage? Yes, that would need to go to the CA, general business, based on my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| of what they might want to do there. Okay, I just wanted to make sure that he didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| have what he needed already. If I may point out to the Commission, there is in one quadrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6210)|
| 1:43:40| in this intersection that has a warehouse. I think going back to the comment of our Vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6220)|
| 1:43:47| Chair, you can either try it tonight and make all the cases and things, but you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6227)|
| 1:44:00| also got your district commissioner has offered a 30-day window to allow for counsel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| maybe is more versed in what's going on here or gives the applicant time to kind of process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| the game plan, and you have a motion right now to give you 30 more days before making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| a decision, but you can make the case to make the decision tonight. I mean, if it was me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6255)|
| 1:44:22| I'd take as much time as possible. May I ask a question of Mr. Morton? Sure. Our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| representative, Mr. Morton. Is 30 days going to be sufficient time to go through this administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6268)|
| 1:44:35| process? You've asked for 30 days. I asked for 30 days simply because I do not understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6275)|
| 1:44:46| the process, and I'm further confused about the process now more than ever. I mean, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| got a sector plan out there that's already supposed to be rezoned, yet it's agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| Now you're asking these people to jump through some more hoops. It doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6298)|
| 1:45:08| At this point in the process, I'm not giving you advice. I'm just trying to lay out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| groundwork here. We have to make a decision before anything else could happen, basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| where he's at currently in the process. So I think what the commission's asking you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| do you want 30 days to prepare an argument to us because we need to make a decision before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| any other steps can be taken within this process? So right now, there's nothing else that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| can do besides make an argument to us, and then once that argument's made, we make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| decision, and depending on that decision, it then goes to a different direction. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| at this point, this is where you're at in the process. So the 30 days would give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6346)|
| 1:45:52| more time to understand where they're at, the argument to be made, and to help your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| case going forward. Another side question to this is, does he need outdoor storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| or is he just looking for indoor warehouse storage with the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| Indoor warehouse storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| Excuse me, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Indoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Indoor, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| It's a combination of warehouse, office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| Sure, so he...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6372)|
| 1:46:12| Which is common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6372)|
| 1:46:14| So he does not need outdoor storage is what I'm trying to get to. There's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| be a fenced-in yard where there is outdoor storage. I'm asking the gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| I think you probably need to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| That's what I'm asking, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| There's going to be probably some equipment part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| You've got to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6389)|
| 1:46:29| You've got to come to the podium. Please state your name for the record and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Well, I have some equipment, you know, like a skid steer and trailers, and they need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| be parked outside. And I don't know, is that considered as outdoor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| We're not talking about supplies and things of that nature, just vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| No, not like... Yeah, just my equipment, trucks, and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| Where does that fall underneath neighborhood commercial? Is that within the realm of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| commercial, or is that still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Sorry, this is tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| Yes, you can have outdoor storage as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| Okay, so he could do neighborhood commercial with use on review for outdoor storage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| his vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| I'm just double-checking to make sure that that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| Outdoor storage of materials, products, or equipment. That would require the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6439)|
| 1:47:25| So he can do... So to your lawyer, if you're hearing what I'm saying, because I can't tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6445)|
| 1:47:31| you what to do, the sector plan says that he could do neighborhood commercial, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6451)|
| 1:47:39| we could do use on review for storage outside, which would fall within the sector plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6459)|
| 1:47:44| idea. It would have to be approved for the use on review part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6464)|
| 1:47:50| So there's a path there, if that's a path that you guys want to take. If you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| stick with the general, or whatever commercial you're going for right now, which is different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6476)|
| 1:48:01| than the current sector plan. So you have to kind of decide if you want to take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| 30 days or not to figure out a new argument, or to re-approach this property under a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6486)|
| 1:48:13| zoning request than the current request you're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| Do you kind of get what I'm getting at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| Well, up to a point, and it seemed to have a split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Are you suggesting that the current zoning is in compliance with the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| No, sir. I can't suggest anything. Your current zoning is agricultural. The sector plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| You're asking for a general commercial. So under the sector plan, if you would ask, let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6521)|
| 1:48:50| me give an example. If I own the property, and I wanted to make it, if I wanted to upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| the property in zoning, in a sense, I can ask for neighborhood commercial. And because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6537)|
| 1:49:02| the sector plan allows neighborhood commercial, I would most likely get it. But if I ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| something outside of what the sector plan is suggesting, it's going to be a harder fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| typically, because it's outside of what we're projecting for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| Are you suggesting that this commission can approve the sector plan tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| I am not suggesting that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| Well, how do you go about doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| I think the point that everybody's getting to is that you may not be asking for the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| thing, and it's confusing, and it may not have gone through the process in a thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| way. You met the client four seconds ago, and perhaps you might want to take a breath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6577)|
| 1:49:44| take the 30 days that's been proposed, go back and kind of work with the staff to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| a new plan of action. Because if this body is forced to take action tonight, it may make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| it further complicated. Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6595)|
| 1:50:01| If you want to provide some testimony, just please state your name and your address for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6601)|
| 1:50:05| the record, and bring the microphone to you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| Amelia Gushchuk, and address 7820 East Emory Road Court in Tennessee, 3721. So at the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6607)|
| 1:50:15| meeting when we were granted denial, basically we were emailed the last steps. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| those were not the right steps that we took, because I was emailed what needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| next. So you're saying we need to act on the sector plan. Well, we acted on whatever we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6628)|
| 1:50:36| were advised by, I forgot her name, Michelle, I think. So what did we do wrong after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6636)|
| 1:50:46| last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| Here's the problem, is we can't necessarily go back, because this is a totally different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6647)|
| 1:50:52| this is a planning staff and a planning commission that took action. So it's not for us to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| back and figure out that they give you the right answer, the wrong answer, left, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| or center. We just have to review what's in front of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6660)|
| 1:51:04| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| What we're saying is clearly something is, the wires are crossed in the process, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| there may be another path for you to achieve what it is you're hoping to achieve. But there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6670)|
| 1:51:16| a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| Because we did apply for sector plan change, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| And there may be other paths for you to consider. So right now, your district commissioner is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6682)|
| 1:51:29| offering you an opportunity to have 30 days to find the right path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| David Larson, can I call for the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| I've got one light that hasn't talked. If you want to, I will stop debate and I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| Yeah, if he wants to talk, talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| But right now, the vote is to postpone for 30 days, so I want to call for that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| That's what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| You're not recognized by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| Okay. You want to call for, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| I'm going to pull that off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| You're going to yield to me, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| That's where I want to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Right. Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Mr. Daly had his light on before, but if he wants to defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| I didn't know Mr. Daly had his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| One question. Director Brooks, why didn't they appeal the sector plan denial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| They could appeal, could they appeal the sector plan denial and the rezoning tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| Why didn't they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Our understanding is the rezoning gets appealed to this body, but you all wouldn't take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| You would send it back for planning commission to reconsider their decision on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6753)|
| 1:52:39| if you chose to overturn their denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Okay. Commissioner Bealey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| No, I'm simply going to say that I'm just, I'm going to keep my motion the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| I think, I know a lot of this is frustrating and it's maddening and there's all these multiple layers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| but that's the reason why this needs to be postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| I mean, and no disrespect, Ken, but I mean, in your own words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| you said they need to secure someone who can guide them through this land use maze, because it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6785)|
| 1:53:13| I've been at this practice of law, Mr. Bealey, you know a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6793)|
| 1:53:17| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| I don't get abused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| That's just not in the, that's not in the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| I'm trying to understand Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| Sure, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| And she's saying that it can go back and have a sector plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6806)|
| 1:53:33| Right now, you have a sector plan that says neighborhood, but it's been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| Well, I mean, I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6822)|
| 1:53:44| That was a different body that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| And so, you know, the only thing we're taking action on is the zoning appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| which is moot until the sector plan is dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| And so I'm going to stick by my motion, and with no other lights on, I would suggest that we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| I'm not going to call for the question, but I suggest that we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Seeing no further lights on, the motion on the table from Commissioner Beeler with a second from Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| or Commissioner Ward, was to defer for 30 days, giving the applicant more time to work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6850)|
| 1:54:17| All those in favor, is this a roll call on appeal or on that action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6862)|

| 1:54:25| Any opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| The motion is accepted, and it will be deferred until the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6868)|
| 1:54:33| and I'm sure Ms. Brooks will help sit down and figure things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| So it will be taken up at the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210823?start=6877)|
