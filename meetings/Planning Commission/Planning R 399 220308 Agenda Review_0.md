| 0:00:29| Hello everybody. Welcome to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=29)|
| 0:00:32| Pat's not going to be here today, so he asked me to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=32)|
| 0:00:36| So Amy's got a report she wants to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=36)|
| 0:00:46| Thank you, Commissioner. Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=46)|
| 0:00:50| Let me move this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=50)|
| 0:00:54| I just have a few updates for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=54)|
| 0:00:57| I want to share from planning and planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=57)|
| 0:01:00| And then we will have a brief presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=60)|
| 0:01:03| and then we'll go through the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=63)|
| 0:01:07| So a couple notable accomplishments from planning staff over the last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| Information Services completed our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| with the Knox County Administrator of Elections and the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:20| We've talked about this a little bit over the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=80)|
| 0:01:22| but so after each decennial census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=82)|
| 0:01:24| the Administrator of Elections and the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| are to adjust voting precinct boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| in response to population growth and decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| And planning staff has played a pretty significant role in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| and they've helped the group split several overpopulated precincts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=94)|
| 0:01:41| in the southwest portion of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| and combine a few precincts with declining population in the center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| The bigger task that our staff were asked to help with though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| was the realignment of precinct boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| to coincide with county commission, school board, and state senate district boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| So by state law, no precinct can serve more than one commission or board district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:02| nor more than one senate district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| and all boundaries must align with the census block boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| This effort, as I mentioned, was pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| It required major GIS support from our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| to reconcile all precinct boundaries with the 7,500 census block boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=136)|
| 0:02:21| that comprise Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| while also preserving the commission, school board, and senate boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=143)|
| 0:02:28| And really I want to commend our GIS analyst Alex Zindel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| and our research associate Aubrey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| who you all have seen before present a couple times over the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| They've received high praise and gratitude from the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| and worked really hard over the last few months on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| I sent out an email last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| You all might not have had a chance to look at it yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| but I want to make sure to keep reminding you all of the great resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| that we have on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| So the Census Data Explorer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| it's a user-friendly way to access the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| This is all provided on the U.S. Census website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=180)|
| 0:03:04| but if any of you have ever been on that website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| it can be really challenging to look up information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| so our staff has created a really great tool to help make that easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| So I encourage you all to check that out along with some of the other tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| that are on that webpage that I sent you a link to yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Advanced Knox, the county's comprehensive land use and transportation plan is moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| We will have seven in-person and one virtual workshop coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| to kick off the first round of community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| You all have hopefully seen these little flyers here at your desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| So there will be a number of activities available on our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=218)|
| 0:03:41| to allow community members to participate in the process and provide input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| and share their ideas in addition to the in-person workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| that you'll see there listed for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| So this is Sunday, March 27th through Wednesday, March 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| I encourage you all to attend and share it with your friends and colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=233)|
| 0:03:57| and encourage them to attend as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| The State of the County Report is anticipated to be released in the next few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| and this report will include issues and topics that influence growth and development in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| such as demographic trends and historical trends in land use and transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| and once that is finalized, staff is currently reviewing it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| We will provide comments and edits back to the consultant team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| and then once it's finalized we'll share it out with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Now I'm going to turn it over to Jeff Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| I mentioned at our last agenda review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| that we would do a presentation on the recently completed North Shore Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| So I've asked Jeff to do this because it is a project that the TPO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| which Jeff is the Director of our Transportation Planning Organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| and TDOT partnered to conduct the North Shore Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| It was completed late last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Thank you, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| For several years, some of our state representatives and county commission chairmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| Larson Jay and before Larson, I just lost his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| have been advocating and former representative Martin and Danny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| have been asking for a corridor study along North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| and as a result of significant development that's going on out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| and further west, west of Concord Road in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:25| to try to identify possible solutions for transportation improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| transportation issues along North Shore Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| So we were able to finally partner with TDOT approximately 18 months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| utilizing funding that the Transportation Planning Organization receives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| and we matched it with funding that the Tennessee Department of Transportation had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| and we engaged a consultant that we had on board already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| that was working on our regional mobility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| to undertake this North Shore Drive Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=350)|
| 0:05:55| Going into this thing, we realized that there is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=355)|
| 0:05:59| going to be almost impossible to fund a total widened North Shore Drive corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| given the intense development along that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| the water features that you have in many places and the bluffs out by Concord Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| That was going to be virtually impossible to, I mean, you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| but there'd be probably a $100 million project or more looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| So we went in and with the consultants and working with TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| City of Knoxville and Knox County identified locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| that we wanted to do more specific analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| So we, the limits of the study were west was at Concord Road where the roundabout is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=391)|
| 0:06:38| and then they had Lions View at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| So we identified eight locations that we wanted to look at potential traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| and spot safety improvements along this corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| and our consultants again working with our local and state partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| did a review of the existing conditions at each of these locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| and then made recommendations for future transportation improvements at these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I will not hit on all eight of these locations but hit on the major ones that are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| that include some sort of relative major construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| So what was done for each of these examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| we're taking a look at each of these sections and areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| and take a deep dive in what are the existing problems at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Here's the existing location at Concord Park Road and Eagle Glen Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| out there by the marina, the lakeside tavern, the boat ramp, the Par 3 golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=449)|
| 0:07:39| A lot of stuff is going on right there with a two-lane roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| and you can have traffic just stop on North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| and it will back up traffic quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| or you have a boat, a vehicle with a boat winding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| and it turned into the ramp and they're having to look for wide enough gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| so you can have a lot of traffic back up in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| So the existing conditions are not really too bad out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| except for some of the major lakes but it does not really reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| in when you do have a stop vehicle on North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| without any turning lane there and traffic can back up quite a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| and we've got several folks, including myself, who go out there and witness that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| So looking at identifying ways to address that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| very tight constraints with the water and then you have the bluff at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| and not sure if I, yeah, my little arrow's not going to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| but you have very tight conditions with water on features there by the boat dock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| and then you have Concord Park, a little bluff there at lakeside tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| So existing conditions, again, looks pretty green on North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| until there's a stop vehicle on either direction, it can fail pretty bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| and then traffic come on out of Concord Park, winding to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| there's significant delays in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| So what was identified was to provide a continuous turn lane from Concord Park Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| where the boat dock is out past the first entrance on Eagle Glen subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| going eastbound as well as sidewalks and an additional turn lane on Concord Park Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| in order to facilitate right turn movements out of there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| and provide better ability for traffic to get in and out of Concord Park Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| and along North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| Long term, it'd be really nice if we could line up the intersection with the boat dock entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| but that would require engaging further to the west end of the park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| and that would be a major transportation improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| Second location is at Bluegrass Road, Chandler Road and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| Again, North Shore Drive is a two-lane roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| very limited locations along the corridor where there's a left turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Here you have a little bit of a sight distance problem with a curve in that regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| and some Chandler Road is continuing to be developed towards the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=607)|
| 0:10:12| significant delays that occur with the turning movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| So what was recommended through the study is a roundabout similar to what we have at Concord Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| would allow for much freer movement of traffic at that location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| would not significantly impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| There's already two of the lakes are relatively vacant properties right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| on the north side of North Shore Drive or they're vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| So it would be not a significant, you know, relocation of any properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| and that to make an improvement to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| We'll skip three and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| There are just minor turning movement recommendations at the other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| And five, location five is at Ebenezer Road and North Shore Drive right there, Bluegrass Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| You have a Y goes on that corner you can see right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| You got Bluegrass Lake just to the south of that T intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| another water body just past the office development to the east there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:17| You have just a tremendous amount of turning movement at this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| And you have adequate laneage there for providing some additional movement support in that regards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| particularly if you're going westbound on North Shore Drive, eastbound, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| on North Shore Drive and approaching which would be, doesn't again show up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| but if you're heading towards in town, again, west is to your left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| and east is to your right on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| You have left turn movements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| It's heavy on Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| It can back up quite a ways, way past the Y goes entrance and almost to the next intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| But you have two approaches into Ebenezer Road going northbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| and you have a lot of back turning movements and backup on Ebenezer Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| where you can see the red box to the north on Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| And if you were able to and with the lane configuration there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| you could have only one receiving lane for the traffic turning left on to Ebenezer Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| You would be able to provide an additional right turn movements on to Ebenezer Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| and that in order to have one receiving moment and be able to add additional outbound movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| from Ebenezer Road to handle the heavy turning movements to get on to North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| So this is how it would look like with an additional dual right turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| out of from Ebenezer Road down to North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| and one receiving lane, again, for the left turn movement going up to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| You'd be able to have much more improved signal timing too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| because you'd be able to handle the dual left turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| You'd be able to help more efficient traffic signal timing at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| Again, providing sidewalks appropriately as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Again, providing sidewalks appropriately as part of the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| Recall the Knox County has a plan for long term to build a greenway along North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| They're making movements already right now west of Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Knox County just built the greenway from Concord Road out to the bridge crossing at North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| The plan would be, again, to carry potentially the greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| or some type of bi-pedestrian movement along the entirety of North Shore Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| 7A is at Wallace Road and North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| There's a senior living facility at the intersection there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| that large complex there on the left corner of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| A major apartment complex off of Wallace Road about a quarter mile back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| as well as three or four subdivisions and that Wallace Road connects you to Nubbins Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| So there's quite a bit of traffic that utilizes Wallace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| You can see there's the turning movements out of Wallace Road are level service F and D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| because during peak hours it's just very difficult to get onto North Shore Drive as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=857)|
| 0:14:23| Heavy traffic on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| So the recommendation here is for improvements to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| adding a turning lane at this location on North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| that would take you back to the entrance to the first subdivision to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| I can't forget the name of that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| Then extending the turning lane past Dunbarton Oaks subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| and tapering off to the east and adding turn lanes on Wallace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| Short of signalizing that intersection, you're still going to have some delays coming out of Wallace Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| but the next iteration would then be providing signalization at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| Morale Road and Ebenezer Road, North Shore Drive rather, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=906)|
| 0:15:17| Very tight intersection right now with heavy commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| all four intersections, the Wigles, Marathon, Casey's now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| and Doc's Donut Shop which my grandchildren asked me to take to whenever they spend the night there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| I have to go there and drop 25 bucks on donuts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| So it's, again I go through that intersection quite a bit at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| and there's the backup on North Shore Drive because of the signal there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| and that is significant in many directions particularly as you're going westbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| as you're coming into town now, there's a lot of backup and delay on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| Not much, very difficult to do things there because it's very expensive right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| with all those commercial properties at those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:09| The concept is try to extend some of the turning movements, change it up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| where you have, right now it's a right turn, if you're coming out of Wright's Ferry Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| it's a right turn and then a through and a left turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| A right turn versus and have a left turn only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| and again sort of extend some of the laneage storage areas as best as you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| and take advantage of a little bit more of the pavement out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| but you should be able to make some improvements at that intersection as a result of some minor striping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| and a little bit of pavement addition at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| 8A is at Lions Bend Road and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| The bottom of the map is Westminster Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| To the opposite end of the T is a condominiums there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| and then to the north of the T intersection is part of the impoundment area for Fort Lowndon Lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| and then Lakeshore Park begins there at the top of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| Right now traffic coming out of Lions Bend is both AM and PM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| is just very difficult to get in and out of Lions Bend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| Obviously level service F for that which is when you look at level service A is very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| and F is very, very bad just like your report card when you're looking at the amount of delay at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| and particularly that case is a 76 second delay over a minute delay for each vehicle to pull out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| And it does not reflect also with during the afternoons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1061)|
| 0:17:50| you can have traffic want to turn left onto Lions Bend Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| with heavy movements coming inbound and access to Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| That whole particular section of North Shore Drive from Lions Bend up to Lions View Pike can be very heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| pretty much a stop and go traffic because I go to Lakeshore Park and park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| and hike and walk quite a bit so I want these improvements as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| So this recommendation here is to signalize this intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| at a left turn lane for traffic going westbound so they can take a left out of Lions Bend Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| and then have through a separate right and separate left turn out of Lions Bend Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:33| and continue the sidewalk along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| Conversation I know with state legislators and Lakeshore City and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| and Lakeshore Park Conservancy about trying to install a turn lane at the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| to Lakeshore Park that was just sort of right off the map there about a couple of hundred feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| and if that can be done maybe it can be combined with this project here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| But a lot of utilities in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| A power station there as well as a water treatment plant right there at Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| And the last intersection is North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| Lions View Road and Westland Drive intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Pretty heavy movements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| A.M. and P.M. many of the intersections operate fail at most times of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| It's a big intersection, a lot of left turn movements in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| Typically you can see in the afternoon traffic stop by Cherokee Country Club or beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1177)|
| 0:19:44| to go westbound on Lions View and Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| And in the A.M. and that it's even in the P.M. afternoon it's really heavy going into Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| The solution that they recommend through here you can look at the footprint of that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| And the solution that they come up with is a roundabout at that location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| with pedestrian movement, accommodating pedestrian movements in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| You can see very little red right now, a little bit of orange on going westbound on North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| through the intersection, but you have the right of way to do that at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| You're constrained a little bit to the west because you have a bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| and going underneath the, I think that's Third Creek if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| right at that location so you're constrained fairly quickly going westbound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| so you can't do a whole lot of widening at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| Bottom line, today's cost, about ten and a half million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Seems low, probably it's already increased ten percent since the study was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| with high construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| That's because we're looking at not doing a whole lot of right-of-way at these locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| trying to make as best as you possibly can within the existing right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| These locations, the most expensive one is those that are down there at North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Lions Bend, and Lions View-Westland Drive intersection just because you're going to have to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| redo the entire intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| Maintain traffic control is going to be difficult at some of these locations and try to build a roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| and maintain traffic so that's all built into these cost estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| But some of these improvements range from $400,000 up to $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| So what this report does puts at least the city of Knoxville and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| to partner with TDOT to be able to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| and work towards trying to fund some of these projects through a variety of sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| whether it's through our transportation planning organization or state various funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| But again, we've shared this study with our state legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| and that just so that they are in a position to know, hey, this now, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| puts local and state legislators and city and county governments in a position to plan for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| and budget for capital improvements for these types of improvements along North Shore Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| if they choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| So now they have projects, they've got a reasonable cost estimate, and how they move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| will be up to them to determine their priorities countywide or citywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| There's a report on our TPO website and we can be glad to share that with you directly if you'd like to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| And I can give it to Dory and she can send it out to all of you here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| if you're inclined to take a look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| So any questions, I'll be glad to take them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| When do you anticipate the recap of the different folks that you mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| ranking these projects and pulling together the different pools of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| to figure out which ones are actually viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| and which ones are probably going to have to wait a few cycles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| Well, I think right now our transportation planning organization is taking project applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| Ten days ago was our deadline for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| I believe a couple of the projects along North Shore Drive were submitted to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| by the transportation planning organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| So again, as a result of this study and other studies that we've been involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| they're trying to move projects already into the pipeline for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| Our process there will be evaluating these project requests over the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and in the September-October time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| It's interesting to me that Lines Bend and North Shore traffic light was proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| but at the Westland North Shore it's a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| How do you decide which is appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| Based on the balance of traffic that is going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| this heavy amount of traffic that is going through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| it's more efficient with a roundabout than you can with a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| With a roundabout you pretty much have continuous traffic movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| versus a traffic signal you're going to delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| Right now I think at that intersection it's a 180-second cycle, which is basically three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| That's a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| If you get caught, you're going to be basically sitting around for about 120, over two minutes or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| for the signal phase to come around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| With a roundabout you're consistently going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| Based on traffic volume and the amount of turning movements and all that that go into their analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| I'm not the traffic guy to give you the specifics, but that's my take it answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| I'll just tell you, because I just happened to be on the website today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| there is a bill in the Finance Ways and Means Subcommittee tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| that would allocate $190 million of overtax collections from 2021-2022 for each county road department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1506)|
| 0:25:15| So each county road department would get about $2 million under that proposal if it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| $2 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| So you could fund like one thing on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Snowden's getting a new car maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Maybe three or four small ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I'm sure Jim already has a list this long for what could be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| Could you speak into your mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| It's about the roundabouts and how those are selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| It's not really relevant to this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| but do roundabouts ever get put into play when it's not the volume of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| but just kind of clarifying a rather kludgy traffic scenario and a light seems too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1553)|
| 0:26:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I mean, you could put in roundabouts basically as some sort of a traffic calming aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| It also can be used as more of a gateway type of area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| as an improvement into a particular district or area that you wanted to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| So it could be used for that purposes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| There are also some you don't have to maintain, like with a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| With a traffic signal, the power goes out or whatever, your signals are flashing or they're down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| With a roundabout, that's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Jeff, could you go back and further explain the scoring of A through F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| Because I think I recently read somewhere where many cities are actually trying to achieve the E score rather than the A score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1603)|
| 0:26:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| In an urban area, we're referring to as level service A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| which is based on traffic delay through level service F and volume and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1617)|
| 0:27:03| as traffic engineers typically have been used in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Typically in an urban area, we should be happy with level service D and even E at certain times of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:15| because of the heavy volumes of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| And we just know over history you cannot build your way out of congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| And quite honestly, like they used to say, if you have a parking problem, that should be good because people want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:30| 20 years ago, there was not a parking problem in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| Now people want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| We're developing downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| People want to go there, so you have a parking problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| So if you didn't have any congestion, pardon me, you could say, well, no one wants to live in Knoxville or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| I mean, Nashville, people are all triping there and they have a lot of congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| But that said, we should be striving for level of service D and in some cases level of service E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| because our congestion, at least now and probably in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| we can tolerate 30 to 45 minutes or even an hour of congestion on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| But to build your way out of doing something like that might take millions and millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| And what is acceptable type of congestion or delay that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| And some communities are ignoring this level of service aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| and they're going to other types of ways to evaluate how they want to have their city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| and community make transportation and traffic improvements all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| so they're abandoning level of service and going to other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Anybody else have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1721)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| All right, so the first item is I just want to briefly review this other business item with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| It is a budget amendment that has been recommended by the executive board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| It would be for FY2022 budget for $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| And it's to undertake a missing middle housing scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| It's basically a study that will look at how we can do a better job of fostering missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1747)|
| 0:29:15| And the definition of missing middle housing is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| a range of house scale buildings with multiple units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| compatible in scale and form with detached single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| So it could be townhomes, duplexes, small fourplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| just a different type of housing than we typically see anymore being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| And so this scan is intended to identify barriers to expanding those housing types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| and provide recommendations to us on how we can improve our codes or policies that might need to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:48| We obviously know that housing is a big issue of concern in this community across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| and missing middle has been identified as one of many tools that can be used to expand housing opportunity for people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| So this would be a partnership with the city of Knoxville as well as the Knoxville Area Realtors Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| who are both putting resources into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Essentially we'll fund the study, but we will be the ones to manage the contract with Opticos, the company that will do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| And I think another benefit of this is because we are doing advanced Knox right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| a lot of what we will learn through this process will help inform any future code rewrites or amendments that we make in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1820)|
| 0:30:29| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| We anticipate this to be, once we get under contract, a three- to six-month process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| and we will provide you all with updates going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| All right, our next item is number 11, 2A22SP2E22RZ, Dan Evans, and Store Safe Storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1843)|
| 0:30:54| And Liz is going to take that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| This is in the northwest city sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| The application is for a 1.6-acre parcel that is west of I-75, west of the frontage road along I-75, Primus Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1862)|
| 0:31:15| and then on the north side of Murray Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| The applicant is requesting to extend the CA zone district into the adjacent parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1879)|
| 0:31:26| The applicant revised their application to include a change to RA zoning as well for a portion of the property with frontage on Murray Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:39| and there's currently an existing single-family residential home on that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| Here's a zoomed-in area map so you can see this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| You can see that it is adjacent to a CA-zoned area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| There is some self-storage in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| So to extend that CA zoning, they are requesting the GC plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| And this area, I don't know if you can see this really faint line right here, but this is â€“| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| we'll look at it in further detail on a couple other slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| but this is the area that they want the GC to extend to as well as the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| And just as a point of information, these are two existing single-family residential homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| and then this is also single-family residential, and these are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| This is what the sector plan looks like for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Again, you can see the general commercial along the frontage road with I-75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| And this is what the existing land use looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| Just noting that there are existing single-family homes that would be split potentially by some commercial activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1970)|
| 0:33:03| So staff is proposing a modified area for the expansion of general commercial on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| to protect the adjacent residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| The area that you see shown in blue on the screen is where the GC land use classification would be expanded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=1993)|
| 0:33:21| This is also shown in your packet that you received as Exhibit B for this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:30| You can see that the adjacent residential area remains intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:38| as shown on the low-density residential classification on the sector plan in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| So it's more just squaring up this existing general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| than taking it all the way to the edge of the adjacent residential parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:34:00| And then this modified area also follows the staff recommendation that is shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| So on the left-hand side, you see the hatching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| This is where the applicant is requesting the CA zone district to extend to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| So it would come all the way down adjacent to these single-family residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| It also bisects a small accessory building as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2062)|
| 0:34:29| And staff is recommending, again, just to square that up rather than bring it all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| And then the applicant is also requesting this hatched area along Murray Drive here to go to RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2075)|
| 0:34:42| And it's about an 18,000 or 15,000, I think, square foot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Staff is recommending a larger RA area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| And this would extend up behind the commercial-zoned area that staff is also recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| just as an extra protection for this adjacent residential property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| So you insinuated that you guys have come up with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| and the applicants requested the one on the left and you're doing the one on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| Have you had any correspondence with the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Are they okay with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Is there a part of it they're okay with and a part of it they're not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Well, we've had multiple conversations with the applicant about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2128)|
| 0:35:33| So they were aware that this was probably going to be the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| They had revised their application once already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| because they initially had had that front parcel shown as agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| and it would have been creating a substandard lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| because of the one-acre lot size requirement for the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| So they modified that to make that RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| but then they kept the commercial zoning line down a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| than staff would have liked to have seen probably in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| If those two residential properties were not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| I think it would be easier to support squaring up the commercial for this whole area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| but there are several properties that would be impacted, I think, by the encroachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| I like the direction you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| I was just curious if we're going to have a bunch of back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| or if you think they're okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| Liz, are they planning on accessing that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| through the adjacent general commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Is it the same owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| That is at least what they're currently proposing, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| or what their current desire to use that property for is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| No more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Do you know if they plan to replant it and combine it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| or will it stay separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| They'll have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| I don't think you could have two principal uses of a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and a commercial use on the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| All right, we'll move on to number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| That is 3B22RZ, MP Development Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| and Liz has got that one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| This is a much larger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| This is a 54-acre site along Irwin Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| This is south of West Beaver Creek Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| and north of Callahan Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| This is a fairly steep-sloped area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| but there is a portion of the site that is relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| The applicant has requested to go from their existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| RA low-density residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| to PR planned residential up to 3.5 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2284)|
| 0:38:11| The sector plan shows the majority of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| as low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| You can also see that there is some hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| shown on the sector plan for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| If we look a little bit further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| at what the actual slope percentages are on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| you can see the really dark red and pinkish or more red areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| Those represent areas of slope that are greater than 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| so that's over 16 acres of this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| have slopes that are greater than 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| There's also a small tributary of Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| that runs through this general area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| and so staff agrees that the environmental design challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| of the site would make it better suited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| for planned residential zoning than the existing RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2347)|
| 0:39:15| This is a 2020 aerial of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| and you can see that it's largely forested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| and this is particularly noted in the very steep-sloped portions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| rear portions of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| and the surrounding lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| are generally greater than an acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| A lot of them are even more than two acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| The ones south of Irwin Road are all agricultural-zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| and are a few acres in size generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| So because of these characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| staff is recommending planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| up to one dwelling unit an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| because it is more compatible with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| and it's also consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| Are there questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| Would they be able to develop on that hillside with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| I mean, they could choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| There's nothing about the planned residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| that would require them not to go into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| It just allows more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| so that they could potentially concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| the majority of the development in a flatter area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| whereas if they had the RA zoning that they have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| they would have to do at least 10,000-square-foot lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| and wouldn't be able to reduce the lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2443)|
| 0:40:49| Because I was just thinking of that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| down in close to Sevier County in Seymour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| where we had like a non-disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Didn't we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| We put a non-disturbance on the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| and went up with the density on the flat section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| No, that one was split-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| It was a lower density on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| on the rear portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| where the steepest portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| So we did put a density on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| But it doesn't necessarily prevent them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| from developing on those steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| There's nothing in the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| that would prevent them from doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| All right, number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| That's a 3A22OYP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| That's planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2500)|
| 0:42:01| I'm just waiting for the screen to pop up back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Okay, so I'm going to go into just a brief overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| of the one-year plan for the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| of the commissioners who are new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| who might not be as familiar with the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| So those of you who are old hat, just bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| So the 2022 one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| well, the one-year plan in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| is not a plan in the traditional sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| So like the sector plans may incorporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| some small area plans, quarter plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| recommendations for specific areas within that sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| The one-year plan is more of a companion document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| to the LANDESMAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| It provides the same location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| and a list of zones that you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| in the LANDESMAP classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| And it does have some policies pertaining to specific uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| but it doesn't make those specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| for properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| Just an overview of how the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| fits in with all the other plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| So in the county right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| we have the 20-year growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| That's where we get properties outside of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| that are designated as either a rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| planned growth area, or urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| We also have the 30-year general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| which, as you all have heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| is kind of undergoing an update at this moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| but it does establish policies and concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| to guide future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| And both of those plans inform the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| The sector plan is also influenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| from the bottom up in the form of quarter plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| small area plans, and as we do those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| they get incorporated into the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| And then the sector plans themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| that's the county and city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| all that land together is divided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| into 12 different sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| some of those being city sectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| and so in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| they can influence the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| So I know looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| there's kind of arrows going everywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| but if you kind of boil that down a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| this, I think, might be a little bit more palatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| So kind of everything funnels into the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| and then the sector plan funnels into the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| So typically in the one-year plan annual update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| we will look at different conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| that might occur between the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| So both of those are future land use maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| The sector plan has city sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| The one-year plan is just city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| so there is some overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| And we'll take a look at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| we are shooting to have those be the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| and that's where we look at conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| And each year, we have this map series| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| that our GIS team does for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| and there is these tabs up here that you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| The one-year plan, sector plan conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| that's where we look at the two maps in comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| And if you click on that map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| these outlined areas would show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| different conflicts within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| And there are conflicts still between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| the one-year plan and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| However, they're all issues that would have to be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| So the one-year plan, because of its annual update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| is more current, more correct than the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| because we've done those every five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| They take a little bit longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| so there's a little bit of lag time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| So in areas where there's still conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| that we've identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| those are ones that would have to be fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| So there's no staff-proposed amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| this year with the annual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| The map series also looks at different conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| between the one-year plan and the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| There are quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Most of these stem from the adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| of the new zoning ordinance back in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| So again, these would be tackled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| as we would do a sector plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| and we would also make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| to do one-year plan updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| so that the two plans can address those conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| So going into the south waterfront mixed-use...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| Well, actually, I'll just say this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| we're making a few recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| in certain land-use classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| So in the south waterfront mixed-use district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| that's that purple area that's close to the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| currently allows R and 1, R and 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| skips over 3 and 4 to include R and 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| and then includes an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| a commercial, and an industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| So we are proposing to add R and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| and R and 4 into that fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| So looking at the uses that are allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| the residential uses within each of these zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| you can see that anything that's allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| in R and 3 and R and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| is also allowed in R and 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| So by including these lesser zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| we're not including or adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| any additional specific uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| So it doesn't change what would be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| use-wise within that land-use class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| These would be added as zones to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| not as zones necessarily outright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| and that's just recognizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| we look at these on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| because in some areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| it may be beneficial to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| into R and 3 or R and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| and maybe not in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| So we're adding that so that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| a little more continuity in that zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| or sorry, that land-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| The next one that we are proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| is in the BP2 land-use class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| That's Business Park Type 2 land-use class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| And there is a Type 1 and a Type 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| If you kind of compare the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| they have the same location criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Every one of these bullet points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| is exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| As for permitted zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| they both allow OP and IRD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| but the Business Park Type 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| also allows IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| So what is IMU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| It's intended to provide for a mix of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| light industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| a variety of compatible commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| It's designed to promote the reuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| of older character-giving structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| and it also allows residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| So looking at the application of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| in both of these land-use classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| we see that BP1 is regionally oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| tractor-trailer transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| It tends to be a little bit more heavy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| The Business Park Type 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| is more locally-owned warehouse distribution services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| and it allows retail and restaurant use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| So if you look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| IMU is applicable to the BP land-use class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| IMU is a zone that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| So one thing that some of these zones have in common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| is that whenever we did adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| there was no corresponding zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| to RN3, RN4, or IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| These are all things that came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| that didn't exist before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| And so when we went through the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| initially we just substituted the new zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| for the zones that were in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| and didn't add in the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| So this is us just kind of going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| reevaluating, and adding in those new zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| where they make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| The BP2 land-use class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| doesn't currently exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2923)|
| 0:48:45| on any of the properties at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| So this change that we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| doesn't directly impact any properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| It would impact properties that would be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| that would maybe have a plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| to go with it to BP2 in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| There are some mixed-use special districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| that allow BP2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| and this would influence those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| but it doesn't impact anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| that directly has a BP2 land-use class currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| And then the final change that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| is more in the residential realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| We have changes that we're making to MDR and MDR-O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| So MDR starts with RN-3 and RN-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| and MDR-O also starts with RN-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| but allows 4, 5, and 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| So we're proposing the RN-2 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| to be added as a zone to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| within both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| And the HDR allows RN-5, 6, and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| So again, we're proposing RN-1, 2, 3, and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| as zones to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| And this kind of goes back to that same reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| I just lost that screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| This goes back to that same reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| that we saw before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| So these zones over here that already exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| incorporate the uses that are already allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| within RN-1 and RN-2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| within RN-3 and RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| So again, we're not introducing any new specific uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| into this land-use class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3005)|
| 0:50:06| and they would be on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| In terms of where we are in the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| in December we started doing our research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| January we had a virtual community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| to discuss the one-year plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Here we are having our planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| and from here it goes to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| for a first and second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| And that's all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Anyone has any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| So is it worth it to have a one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| while you have a sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| To go through that extra step, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| That seems to be the big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| They are a little bit redundant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| The one-year plan does have some policies in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| that the sector plan doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| And then maybe as the county's comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| gets updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| who knows what will happen with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| So right now we're just using both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Whether that's always the case is to be determined, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| Is it still heard periodically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Like if you wanted to make an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| on the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| do I remember correctly that that's only heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| like every three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| They are heard quarterly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| So if you want to rezone a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| and it's not in alignment with the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| then you have to request a one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| and those are heard in January, April, July, and October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| Because that can be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3086)|
| 0:51:32| Nothing else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Just along those same lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| if we were to ever transition to removal of the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| where it was just the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| what would be the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| or like who would have to approve that or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| if that were to ever happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| The one-year plan is part of the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| So it would...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| So that would have to be city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| City council would have to initiate that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| When do we update the sector plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| Well, historically, we've done them every five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| They are on a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| not a set schedule, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| Again, so when the county, the decision was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| we're not going to update sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| we're going to update the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| and then the city is also asked planning over the next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| to identify a land use update strategy for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Could you go back to the chart on the page 18, I think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| The incorporation of the lower densities into HDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3171)|
| 0:52:57| I know you touched on that briefly, the reasoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| but HDR stands for high-density residential, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3180)|
| 0:53:05| I'm just curious, like, wouldn't, by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| the R and 1, 2, and even 3 and 4 be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3190)|
| 0:53:17| You are saying that this amendment would add those as allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| As zones to be considered, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Yeah, so we would look at those on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| like we do with rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| So in some areas, it might make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| in a high-density residential land use class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| depending on what's around it and how it's actually been built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| In some cases, maybe not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| We don't see any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| there wouldn't be any adverse impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| by adding these less intense zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| They have a lighter, you know, typically a lighter impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| So that's why we're recommending them as zones to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| Okay, awesome. Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| All right, is that it? Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Move on to final plats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| Number 29, 3SV22F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| That's the final plat of the replat of Lot 1, Hawkeye's Corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| and Michelle, that's you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| Okay, so this is a final plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| We don't really talk about these too much in these kind of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| This one is a plat on the corner of White Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| and South 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Contextually, you can see it's a parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| surrounded by some taller buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| This area has seen a little bit of development in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| This is the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| The purpose of the plat is to remove the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| and drainage easement along all the lot lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| in order to meet the form-based code requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| The sewer lines that are serving this street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| are in these streets right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| You can see the red circled areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| are at the beginning of the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| They're also in the alley, although the alley cuts off in the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| They're not shown, but I have spoken to KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| and they did confirm that there is sewer lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| running through the alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| You have heard a little bit about this, some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| There's a neighbor to the north that is afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| that because they are not offering utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| and drainage easements on this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| that that would force the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| to be moved onto their property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| and that's why they're opposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| But KUB does not move lines into another owner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| So if something did happen, and this property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| wanted to move the utility line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| if it wasn't in the right-of-way where they're opposing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| they would have to provide some sort of easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| within their own property to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| So they'd have to figure out a way to make it work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| for themselves within their own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| without the burden of that utility line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| being moved onto someone else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| So the zone is CU-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| That's the Cumberland Avenue form-based district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| And so, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| they're trying to come into compliance with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| So the CU-5 district has a 5-foot minimum setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| at streets and alleys and a 5-foot side interior setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| And because they've got some frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| along both of these streets and along the alley here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| that would be considered a frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| the way that it's defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| So there's a 5-foot setback along those three property lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| and then the 5-foot interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| So they basically have a 5-foot setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| along the entire perimeter of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| Utility drainage easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| consist of a 10-foot exterior lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| So that's going to be, again, these three properties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| So there's a 10-foot utility drainage easement requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| but a 5-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| And then this property line here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| that's their interior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Oh, wait, let me put my...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| So this property line here, that's the interior lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| They would have a 5-foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Those, they match in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| So the PLATS requesting to drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3400)|
| 0:56:42| the utility and drainage easement completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| in order to comply with the zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| But as you can see, this lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| it's already in compliance because they're the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| However, because there's no utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| within any of these areas that they're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| and KUB had no issues and problems with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| we are recommending approval of the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| and drainage easement removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| and therefore the variance for the PLATS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| And this is just some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| As far as the utilities overhead lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| you can see those outside of the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| in the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| Here might be a better image of it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| And the street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Interestingly, the party that's opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| owns this building here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| which does go all the way up to the lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| so they have the same type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I think that they're not happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| with this applicant proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| So is there any questions about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| No questions? We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Under concept plans, development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| number 15, 1SA22C, 1D22UR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| the Brown property on Couch Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| and Mike Reynolds has this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| All right, I'm just going to let the map pop up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| There it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| All right, so this has been postponed a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| so you might be familiar with seeing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| on the agenda previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| It has been revised since the original submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| The original submittal had 393 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| with 278 detached units, 115 attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| It has been revised to include 359 detached units only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| so there's no longer attached units within the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| You did receive a revised staff report on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| County Engineering asked for a more specific condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| regarding improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| to the Sandley and Steel Road intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| so that's condition number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| It's a...read it as it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| per discussions at County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| offsite improvements, including sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| and intersection improvements at Sandley, Steel, Swofford Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| shall be completed in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| with Knox County Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| before issuing a plat and agreement codifying the timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| and cost sharing shall be executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| So that's the 16th condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| Just looking at the general area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| so Steel Road is to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| and Steel Road is, you know, adjacent to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| the schools at Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Sandley Road, so Steel Road connects into Sandley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3579)|
| 0:59:45| and this property is off of Couch Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| just to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| Just generally speaking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| there's a large area of undeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| One of the things that we were concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| from a staff perspective is making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| to retain a north-south connection opportunity going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| That's also highlighted in the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| which you can see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| The area highlighted in red| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| is a general location of a north-south connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| It obviously wasn't studied to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| of determining how that would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| but it is a recommendation of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Something that the plan also recommends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| is actually creating an east-west connector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| between Mission Hill Lane and Steel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| I believe it would be on the north side of the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| but I could be mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| It's kind of hard to see on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| It's really hard to tell from back here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| how loud I'm actually talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| I think the speakers are right above us maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| So the proposal does include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| three stub-out roads to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| So this is the overview of their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| So Couch Mill Road is to the north here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| They have two access points to Couch Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| and two stub-outs to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| into the remaining portion of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| So this development is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| only a portion of the actual property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| The third stub-out is to the western side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| southwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| So they are retaining those potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| north-south connections in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| This plan, if you zoom in just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| you probably have seen some comments on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| in regard to the number of sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| and such on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| And that's what you're seeing left over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| these areas with no houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| are predominantly areas where the sinkholes are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| During the design plan phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| which is the permitting phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| we'll get into those in a little bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Some house lots may move a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| depending on what they find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| but generally we expect that this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| could be accomplished greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| which you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| They do have amenity features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| So they have a structured amenity feature with pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| kind of like a pool house and a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| at this western entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| They also do provide sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| throughout the neighborhood on one side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Some of those sidewalks would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| for the county sidewalk ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| because there's at least 1,000 trips per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| projected on those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| The rest of the streets would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| up to their discretion to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| and would be private sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| or I guess the neighborhood would have to maintain those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| There's also, you can see through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| some of these open spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| there's a trail system that's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| through the open spaces as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| So there's quite a bit of walking opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| throughout this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| There was one community comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| about the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| There are two that are right next to the sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| that are in the kind of open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| that's avoiding the sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| but there are two properties placed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| I can't read the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Yeah, let me go to a different plan sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| which has, it'll be a little easier to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| It was 241 and 262.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| So it's these two here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| So you can see 241 here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| it's access is to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| I'll zoom out just a little bit here in a sec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| And then 262 is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| So there's buildable area in these lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| outside of the buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| They can, so you can build a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| within a sinkhole buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| but you have to have a geotechnical study done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| and engineered foundations for those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| But they do have area outside of the buffers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| So you can see 241 gets access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| from the cul-de-sac to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| and I think it was 262| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| disconnects into this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| But yeah, those are the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| that were mentioned in the comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| Yeah, I thought it was an interesting suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| that those two properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| if they were not developed as single-family residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| what that actually does to that open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| and the walking trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| and how it makes that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| really be able to use those areas more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| And I don't really know the protocol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| for suggesting that those might be reconsidered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| but I thought it was a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3903)|
| 1:05:11| I can talk about, I guess get back with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| on if there's a suggested way to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| But, I mean, the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| could make an approval with conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| of removing those two or making them smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| There could be different ways of handling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3925)|
| 1:05:37| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| All right, we'll move on to number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| That is 3SD22C and 3F22UR Morning Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3943)|
| 1:05:50| And that is Mike Reynolds as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| Okay, I just wanted to briefly go over this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| because it is a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| than what we typically see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| This is a complete private road subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| Let me zoom in just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| So it's 57 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| and they're requesting a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| of the right-of-way width for a private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| from 50 feet to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| So private right-of-ways, private roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3977)|
| 1:06:20| they have to meet county road standard as a default,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| which, as we see in most subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| it's 50 foot wide right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| and a 25 foot, I'm sorry, 26 foot road pavement width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:34| from face of curb to face of curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| Here they're asking for a reduction to 40 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| which the subdivision regulations do allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| the Planning Commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| a reduction down to 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| They can, Planning Commission can also approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| a reduction of the pavement width down to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| They're somewhat asking for a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| of the pavement width here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| because when they measured their road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| they measured it from back of curb to back of curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| which is at 26 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| but really it should be measured face of curb to face of curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| so it's 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| So there is technically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| an alternative design standard request in here as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| to reduce the pavement width to 25 instead of 26 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| One, so something that you'll probably hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| during the Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| is a concern from a neighbor to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| I'm sorry, to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| the south on this sheet, but to the west in reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| is they've got a pond that is approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| I can show you on the map if you need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| but it's actually a pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| that is created by a dammed stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4068)|
| 1:07:52| So they're concerned that they have fish in the pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4072)|
| 1:07:56| that they're trying to protect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| and obviously as this property develops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| there could be some siltation and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| that get into the water, into the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| It's pretty hard to keep it out 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| so you're going to hear that concern most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| during the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| They also, the same neighbor also has a honeybee farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4099)|
| 1:08:26| on this property, so they're also a bit concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| with how that could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| have an adjacent neighborhood next to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| how that could impact their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| or their farming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| One thing that I did find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| let me pull this up real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| before the, just today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| is I over, I laid their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| over the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| and I did find that their project appears to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| extending into the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| even though their plan shows that they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| So I'll flip back to their plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| I'll show you what they're showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| So they outlined the hillside protection area here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| being north of their cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| but I'm going to have to have them update this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| and give us how much grading they're actually going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| into the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| As you can see here, anything that's in green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| is in the hillside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| so they actually are going into it a decent amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| Just wanted to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Hopefully we'll have more information on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| or before then, I can share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| Yeah, I was going to ask you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| so the 40-foot right-of-way can be a public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| it can stay public with a 40-foot right-of-way, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| Yeah, someone could request a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| of a right-of-way to 40 feet, for instance, if it's public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| It would be a variance request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| and we would need to get support from county engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4214)|
| 1:10:17| in most cases, but yes, it can be a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| It doesn't have to be a private road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Okay, so this person is making it private, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| They are, and they've got some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4228)|
| 1:10:33| that they're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| They have some tighter horizontal curves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| than what we typically want to see on a public road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| and they have their traffic circle at their entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| as you kind of get back onto their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| So because of the type of design they wanted to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| it really made more sense for it to be a private road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| than a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Just so you're aware, they are providing a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| on at least one side of all the roads as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| Could they reduce the circle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| that's in the hillside protection area any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| to limit the amount of disturbance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4271)|
| 1:11:13| They could shorten the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| and put the lots towards the end of the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| I think that there's ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4278)|
| 1:11:19| that they could reduce the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| of grading into the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| We'll see what kind of options they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| I think shortening the road is not going to be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| post-planning commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| say this plan got approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| Generally, as we see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| if they wanted to shorten that cul-de-sac a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| and put some lots at the end of the cul-de-sac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| I mean, that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| that we could just administratively approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| If they wanted to extend that road further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| then it becomes more of a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| and whether or not they would have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| through concept plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| Is the hilltop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| based off a certain elevation point or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| No, it's actually, I can't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| exactly how many contiguous acres it's supposed to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| but there's a threshold of contiguous acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| above 15% that brings the slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| into the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| So in this case, it's on a side of a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| There's a whole lot of contiguous area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| and then it's anything uphill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| from that steep slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Well, I just mean specifically in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| if it were, is it possible that they did a survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| and the topography was different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| from what it reads on KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| to the point that that would have caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| the discrepancy or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4361)|
| 1:12:43| No, it doesn't have anything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| with a certain contour line or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Now, we found that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| it did show that our contour maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| were just completely off, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| by a good amount on where the base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| of the slope actually began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| So probably fairly unlikely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| Just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| I don't think we necessarily have to get Steve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| or Jim to come up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| and give us a tutorial on off-site ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| with fish in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| but I remember this sweet couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| that were next door and told us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| that they'd have this property forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| and they had a pond there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| that was very clean and had fish in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| and I would assume if they've dammed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| a blue line stream or if they created this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| and that's off-site drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| you guys wouldn't treat it any differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| than you've got to detain your water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| you've got to have water quality standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| and, you know, how you treat it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| on the downhill side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| I just want to make sure that everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| really understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| If they come up there and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| hey, you know, they're going to drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| into our pond and that's more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| private matter than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| Yeah, it's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| All right, that does all the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Does anybody have anything they'd like to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| Another item that we didn't discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| or anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| If not, I guess we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| See you on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220308-agenda-review?start=4464)|
