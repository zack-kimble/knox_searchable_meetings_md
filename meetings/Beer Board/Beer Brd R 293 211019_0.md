| 0:10:03| You're welcome. The spot, Mr. Burr has withdrawn. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| All right. We don't have any addendum items, so we don't need to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| But we do have an administrative hearing under 6A, and that's coming up as Leon Enterprises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=614)|
| 0:10:26| Welcome to Beer Board. If you could give me your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| It's Arturo Leon, 118 North Forest Park, Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| Looks like you had a citation for sale to a minor the first in a two-year period back in October of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| Then you had submitted a remedial plan in November of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| Then you recited for a second sale in a two-year period September 29th of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| You've received the notice of administrative hearing, and we've received your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| Sent in your fine as of October the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Can you talk to us about what happened and what your remedial plan, what your plan of action is to not have this happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=666)|
| 0:11:13| Yes, sir. Unfortunately, it happened last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| We got 13 years on business, and that happened the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| Unfortunately, we have a lot of problems with the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| We got a shortage of employers always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| On these days, nobody wants to work anymore, looks like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| But anyways, I know there's still a lot there, but I'm trying to make meetings every week to my employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=691)|
| 0:11:42| so they understand how important it is to check their IDs always so it doesn't happen that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=702)|
| 0:11:53| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Sergeant Coward, in your experience, is it usually a good idea not to just have weekly meetings, discuss this maybe every shift?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| So you might want to consider doing that every shift as well, not just once a week having those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| Once a week, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Yes, for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| But I'll let the fear board members ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=732)|
| 0:12:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| Not hearing any questions, there are two options for a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| We can accept their remedial plan, which means that we take no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| So if within a rolling two-year period they have another violation, they will automatically go to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=752)|
| 0:12:40| or we can refer them to a suspension revocation hearing night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| Mr. Cross, did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| So we can not take any action, and if I don't see any hands go up, then that's what I will assume we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=769)|
| 0:13:00| I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| I got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| I see from your mediation plan that there's a question that asks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| have all of your employees received service card training or how to properly check ID, and you answered no to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| Can you explain why all the employees haven't gone through that training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| They'd be always in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| That's their biggest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| They'd be in a hurry because normally it's, for example, four servers, and this time it was only two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=804)|
| 0:13:32| So they'd be in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| That's something that we always in a hurry, and that's why that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=813)|
| 0:13:42| I know it's not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| We got to put attention on that anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| No matter if we have to spend three minutes, four minutes watching the age and the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=827)|
| 0:13:57| Would you be willing to commit to a weekly check-in with all the employees or some type of training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Without it, it looks like you're always going to be in a hurry, like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Like I say, always we encourage them to do that, to check their IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| We have 13 years on business, and it only happens two times in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| It sounds normal to some point because they're in a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=861)|
| 0:14:28| Because the hurry we have, we get the problems of the shortage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| I've been talking to a lot of people that have the same problem, but unfortunately that happened to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| It's not an excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| I'm going to work very hard on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Yes, I noticed a couple more no checks on the questionnaire there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| One was, have you obtained a minor's reducing major liability DVD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| Those are available through the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| Have you thought about obtaining those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Have you done that yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Big change is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| You have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Council Member Thomas, I didn't hear the beginning of what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Sorry, Council Person Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| I had noticed that there had been a couple more no checks on the questionnaire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| and I was asking him, the first one was about the DVD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| He said that he had obtained one since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Then the second one is about, do you have an incentive program for kind of rewarding employees who you know are diligent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=934)|
| 0:15:45| If so, what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| That would be great to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Are you willing to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| I also underline what Sergeant Coward said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| I think you need to be having these meetings, and this is for your own good, more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| And you get one more violation, assuming that we don't take action today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=969)|
| 0:16:15| and it's going to be really hard for you to make amends on that for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| We don't want you to slip up again, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Sergeant Coward, you had something to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| As far as question three is concerned, state law does not require server card training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=992)|
| 0:16:40| They have up until 60 days for a new hire to get their server card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| So that, you know, some new hires may not have had time to receive that server card training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| That's one reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Well, I have a question for Sergeant Coward real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| and then I'll have a question for the gentleman from the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| Mr. Coward, or Sergeant Coward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| it used to be state law that to serve an alcoholic beverage in Tennessee you had to see ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| Has something changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| It depends upon the type of permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| With an on-premise permit, which is what they have, they do not have to check ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| And they never did have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1054)|
| 0:17:36| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| State law reads prior to a sale of beer for off-premise consumption, they have to show ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1058)|
| 0:17:45| So that would be more for convenience stores, grocery stores, places like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| So I just want to say we've had several hearings like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| and in my experience from people who've had violations that continued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| because people do get into a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| We go through these same talking points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| and talking with and talking and reminding staff never seems to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| And then we end up seeing you again, and it costs you a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1097)|
| 0:18:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| What it seems to be, and sometimes it's very busy restaurants, like chain restaurants and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| which I understand that they have maybe high enough volume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| franchise restaurants that have more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| because I'm not trying to make it hard on the local smaller restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| but a lot of those restaurants will use, like, point of sale scanning and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| In other words, like, I'm assuming at your restaurant, because I've eaten there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| It's delicious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| You have a great soup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| The bar, the beverages are coming from the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| They're not coming from back in the kitchen, and there's staff at the bar typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| So in some of these franchise restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| the bartender cannot prep the drink or will not dispense it based on just an order from a waitress or a waiter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| but they have to have the date off the ID to be able to activate the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| And that seems to be one of the better methods that some of the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| fall back to is a system where you have to have a birth date to be able to make the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1169)|
| 0:19:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| So I would recommend, I don't know what pricing on stuff like that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| I mean, I don't want to throw out names of restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| I think those are conversations that maybe Sergeant Coward or somebody we could have with you to say, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| hey, this restaurant's done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Maybe you could ask them what system they used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| And maybe you have other peers in the community that you could ask if they do similar systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| because we don't want you to have to come back, and we want you guys to have success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| And I assume when this happened, what happened with the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| Well, she was in a hurry, and she went to the table and asked for the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1210)|
| 0:20:18| but she watched the ID, but she didn't put attention on the right number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| She said, well, it's just a mistake of the number of what I looked, but it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| But is she still employed with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Yeah, she's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Was she reprimanded in some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| She had to go soon to liquor by the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| The training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Training, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| I would consider looking to see if there's some other methodologies that involve more than just having meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| and conversations and verbal reminders, that there needs to be some other triggers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| where an order cannot be filled until a date is confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| Yeah, I was thinking to bring someone to do a class or something to all my staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| and not only the servers, but everybody, so they know what the problem looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| And as asked by Councilman Thomas, you did get the DVD or the disc from the Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| Say again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| So in the checklist that you completed, the remedial plan guide, question number five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| have you obtained a minors reducing a major liability DVD toolkit from the Metropolitan Drug Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1295)|
| 0:21:45| I believe Councilman Thomas asked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| And in the checklist here, you checked that you did not have that disc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| But do you have it now from the Metropolitan Drug Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I'm not sure, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| I would think that that would be advised for you to get that and include that in your toolkit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| for things that you can train yourself and your employees with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| It's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| Okay, that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| And you're in luck because we have somebody from the Metropolitan Drug Coalition who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| She just waved at you, so she can help you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| And the other thing is that Sergeant Coward would be more than happy to come out and visit with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| and talk about training and techniques.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| And so if you wanted to schedule that with him after our meeting, that would be okay too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| So you've got two resources there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| We want you out in the community doing what you're doing for business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| and not coming in here and meeting with us because of a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| The gentleman, you're trying very hard, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| We're trying to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| I'm so concerned about it, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| I do feel our functions as far as sales, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| The remedial plan guide shows five instances or suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| of how a business owner could make it more possible to remedy these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1392)|
| 0:23:22| And there's room for improvement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| I've noticed there's five different areas where you had checked no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| And so I think I would like to suggest maybe a postponement for about maybe two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| and then during that time the applicant could maybe check with Sergeant Coward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1416)|
| 0:23:45| and get the information they need, and then we could take another look at it in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Would that be okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| Yeah, that would be good, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| So, Mr. Thomas, you're asking for a postponement of this administrative hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| to the December meeting, and then we'll see you again then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| and we'll have another opportunity for you to complete your remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| Is that something you'd be willing to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Well, we'll need a motion for that, but we'll keep our discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Can he sell or not sell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-211019?start=1464)|
