| 0:01:37| Is there anyone here that wishes to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| I have three names, consonants, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=101)|
| 0:01:53| Ma'am, are you wanting to address something that's on our agenda or something that's off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=113)|
| 0:02:02| the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| I was, my issue is really dealing with the public park and rec facilities that are located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=123)|
| 0:02:10| particularly in the East Knoxville's vicinity, dealing directly with the E.V. Davis Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| and the Cal Johnson Center, and trying to get an understanding as to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| Can I get your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| My name is Constance Moneika-Every, I run a non-profit organization known as Sleaze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| for Needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| We are 501C3, we have two physical agents, the Beck Culture Center and Connect Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Okay, go ahead, you have about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| So, my issue is, as I said before, is dealing with the concerns of the E.V. Davis Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| in particularly, given the fact that by date, I can actually name by date, four times I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| been to this facility to try to access it, to use just the basketball gym and the small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| fitness center that they have available there, and four times I've failed to get access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Like I said before, let me open my calendar on my phone, I'll name by date and time when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| I visit this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| So my first visit was on May 2nd, which was a Wednesday, I visited at 9 a.m., and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| I went to the building, it was locked up completely, like I could not access it, there was no times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| listed on the door, there wasn't even an emergency contact that listed on the door for something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| that happened at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| So then I said, okay, well, maybe just something's going on, and for whatever particular reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| this facility wasn't open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| So I came back Monday, May 7th, and I actually chose a different time, like, well, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| I came a little bit too early, maybe they open later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| So Monday, May 7th, I went at 10 a.m., same thing, facility completely locked up, no access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| no entry, no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| So then I came back again on May 17th, which was a Thursday, I came there at 10.30 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=227)|
| 0:03:54| same encounter, doors locked up, no access, no entry, no one available at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| And then I went today, which is the 21st, and I went at 11.30 today, and same encounter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=239)|
| 0:04:06| locked up, no access, no entry, no one available at the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| So my question is, how is this a city park and rec facility, but it's not available to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Who's supposed to be overseeing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| Who's the contact person, matter of fact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Like I said before, there's not even a contact listed on the door, if the building was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| fire, passed down a 911, who would you call and say, hey, the building's on fire for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| There is no way to access that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| I have not successfully, in four encounters, actually been able to access that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| So I'm just trying to figure out, is it for the community or is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| That's really the first question off the top, and if it is, why is it not open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| What are the hours of operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Who's the overseer or the building manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| What is the functionality of the building been existing in our community for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| and usage of the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| I just need some answers to a couple of these questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| Can I stop you, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| You're talking about a city rec center of city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| This is the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Try 311 or the city's parks and rec division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| That's your answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=305)|

| 0:08:46| Well, I think there were some folks here in the audience that were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| We had had a discussion on adding a discussion about Hardin Valley development, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| asking the MPC to do a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| And there's some folks here and I don't know if they want to speak, but I don't think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=542)|

| 0:09:07| to do a gross study out just in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| So, it's not on the agenda this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=554)|

| 0:09:20| Is it item 38, the mobility study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=560)|
| 0:09:30| No, I think that's the road study out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| I think there's a development MPC type study they're wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=572)|
| 0:09:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| The mobility's roads, I believe, on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| So, let's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| It says mobility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| Is it something separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| You want to add a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Is Snowden here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| Is that mobility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Is that dealing with development or just the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Is that dealing with Cherahala?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| It's road related?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Is it going to have Cherahala in the mobility study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Is it pulled off of its consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=610)|

| 0:10:20| And I have some people here who have signed up, I believe, for public forum on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| And I just wanted to check and see if they wanted to go ahead and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| I know Ms. Rowe and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| Do you want to go ahead and speak for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=637)|
| 0:10:49| We already have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| But, look, can we go ahead and set the agenda and then we'll let them speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you, Mr. Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| I have just one question, and it is for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| And it's just a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| And I was wondering, could I ask that during the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| Well, it's the ones that have the grants and grant sizes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=673)|
| 0:11:17| Just one general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| A lot of them have grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| I just have one question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| It's nothing specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| I need a motion and a second to set the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Mr. Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Sorry, my light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I do have two items that I'd like to remove from consent just to talk about very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| That's item 46 and item 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=713)|
| 0:12:14| Mr. Bussler would also like to pull number 15 from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=734)|
| 0:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| Do I have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Ladies, if you all would like to come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Did you want to invite the people back up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Jamie, would you all like to go ahead and speak about the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=762)|

| 0:12:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Were you wanting to address the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=786)|
| 0:13:22| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| I'm an attorney with Long Ragsdale Waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Recently was retained following the April meeting and into May by Mr. Gennard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| After that meeting, he came and consulted with me and asked that I represent him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| Before the commission meeting, since then, I've made a couple calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| One of the commissioners' suggestions, went and walked the property with the surveyor last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Surveyor met with MPC professional staff last week as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| and got some comments from them and some potential suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| and possible support of other development options that MPC professional staff would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| We're asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=856)|
| 0:14:18| Like I said, I just got retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| I'm trying to get up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I think the plan is for the surveyor to present and prepare an additional site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| taken into MPC professional staff's comments, their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| and thoughts of what they would possibly support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| I just haven't had enough time to really get up to speed on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| Several things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| My family and I were selling our house and moving this Friday, trying to buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| It's been chaotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I'm just trying to get in touch with everybody and get up to speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Like I said, with the end of the school year coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| it seems like a good bit of people have been out of town, and my schedule has been hectic as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| If we could defer to the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| I know I reached out to Commissioner Carringer last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| stating that we would be requesting a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| Like I said, not trying to do it at the meeting, trying to prevent everybody from showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| So everybody's not here that may either be in support or opposition of this on the meeting day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| Again, if we could have a deferral to the June meeting to allow us to potentially go back to the drawing board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| prepare alternate site plan or plans, and have that ready and prepared to go at the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| What is before the commission at this point is a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| and we've already agreed to one postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| That was last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| We've already chartered a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| We've emailed or called everyone on our list who attended the community meeting that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| Flowers have been delivered to neighbors regarding the May meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=965)|
| 0:16:11| and we've also asked people to postpone their vacations from the end of school to this May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=971)|
| 0:16:18| They were going to leave right after the end of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| and we asked them to not do that because we needed them to be at the May 29th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| So for all these reasons, we are against a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| If he wants to start all over with something else, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| but right now what is before commission is a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| and we do not want in favor a postponement because we have agreed to one already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1003)|
| 0:16:52| So I don't know if that's something that we have got to take a vote on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1012)|
| 0:17:02| It's not on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| We can't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| I don't think you can vote on a postponement tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| And so I had this on for a discussion item for later, and I think everybody should have gotten a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| I had printed out a hydraulic plan from Mr. Smote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| I think everybody get a copy of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| But anyway, to represent my community and what has been done and the hard work that we've been working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| because Mr. Ganard never had a final plan or anything to show us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| We had over 100 people at our community meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| so I'm not in favor of postponing this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| So I don't know where we go from here, but I can't support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| because I represent my community and my constituents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| There's just been no organization on any of this from the developer side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| So it's kind of like I guess his lack of planning doesn't institute an emergency on everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1084)|
| 0:18:11| but that's what he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| We have gone and we've done our homework and planned our meetings and sent out the letters and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| So I don't know why he's so behind on all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| and I think it's because he doesn't have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| We'll discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Approval of the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1120)|

| 0:18:45| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1125)|
| 0:18:58| Page one, item six is a resolution honoring Travis McKinney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| upon the occasion of his receipt of the Keller Williams Relative International Rookie of the Year Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1142)|

| 0:19:12| Move with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1152)|

| 0:19:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Those that oppose say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| Page two, item number ten is approving an amendment to the Intergovernmental Memorandum of Understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| by and between Knox County Government and Knox County Department of Risk Management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| under the Mayor of Knox County, Knox County Schools, and the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| to amend the Self-Insured Workers' Compensation Program for all Knox County School employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| This is resolution 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| I wanted to pull this off the consent agenda because I wanted to bring Mark Jones and Evan Houser down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| Evan here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| I wanted to take a moment to recognize not only them but Scott Bolton with the Benefits Department over in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| What they've been able to do with this program is pretty amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| We are actually providing a safety net to our teachers while at the same time saving the county taxpayer money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1212)|
| 0:20:20| So I just wanted to recognize both of you for your hard work on this and putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| And if you wouldn't, go ahead and say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1226)|
| 0:20:34| I'm about saying a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| You know, the great thing about this is the partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| And working closely with Scott Bolton and Adam Parsons and then with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| with Evan and his staff, and then the mayor's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| Chris Caldwell was a big factor in putting this together, but it really has saved the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| We tried to outsource this, the workers' comp program, a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| We had two different third-party administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| It just didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| And bringing it back in-house, Mr. Armstrong and I talking about it, bringing it back in the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| has really saved the county a significant amount of money, and we've provided much better service to our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| So it's really a good cooperative relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| If I can just provide some context, my department took over the administration of a workers' comp program effective 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1282)|
| 0:21:31| At that point in time, our annual expenses were about $1.8 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| and we've reduced those on the county side to about $1 million a year as of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| What's before the commission today is a motion to approve the modification of the memorandum of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1302)|
| 0:21:49| between the schools and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| We've been working closely with Adam Parsons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| His department is actually here today with them on their program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| They were kind enough actually at Chairman Smith's recommendation a couple years to give us some numbers to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| to determine whether it was possible for us to bring them under our umbrella and save them some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| At the time, they were paying about $1.6 million a year annually to be fully insured with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1330)|
| 0:22:22| However, they did not have coverage for their teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| and so we took a look at the numbers and, after coming to an agreement with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| decided they would pay us a deposit premium to be self-administered under our program for the same amount, $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| We also, through the approval of the school board, added coverage for all the teachers who did not previously have workers' comp coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| and I've been pleased to announce that actually after the first two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| we have come in right at about $1.1 million the first two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| So we're close to about $1 million worth of savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| and, frankly, I think we're giving better service to our employees, teachers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| So thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| I just wanted to point that out because it's very seldom in government that you get a win-win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| where you're actually able to provide a safety net for teachers who were exposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| and in the past, if they were injured, they either had to pay out of pocket or they sued the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| Now they are protected, and it actually saves money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| Commissioner Gale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| And I think that is a very poignant point that we must underscore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1407)|
| 0:23:34| that classified and certified teachers now have workers' compensation in the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| because we were exposed in terms of our liability of not providing coverage for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| who serve the best interests of our students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| Can we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1434)|
| 0:24:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1444)|

| 0:24:06| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| On page 3, item number 15 is a resolution authorizing the acceptance of federal Title IV-A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| student support and academic enrichment grant funding from the Tennessee Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1455)|

| 0:24:26| This is resolution 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| It is basically a general question on a lot of these grants that are already on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| that the school is accepting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| And my one question is to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| is these grants going to be handled in-house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| or are you going to have to hire additional personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| to administer any of these grants that are on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| Mr. Chairman and Commissioner Bussler, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| All of the management of this is in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| Give your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| I'm Melissa Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| I'm the Executive Director of Student Support Services for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| But all of the management of the grants are handled in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| There's a section called indirect costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| which are monies that the grants allow to be paid to things like the management of payroll, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1519)|
| 0:25:26| And so those go to our finance department to manage that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| It's just a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Just make sure that we're not hiring people under the grants for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| So not to do the management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| We are hiring some staff to do some specific duties with the grant money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| but not the management of the grant itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| You're very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1545)|

| 0:25:52| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| On page 4, item number 23 is a resolution approving a contract with Dog Inspectors LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| to provide canine pest detection services for Knox County Libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| This is resolution 217.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1569)|

| 0:26:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| I just pulled that off because I was wondering if anybody had any questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Is this for the bed bugs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Is there anybody here from the library system or purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1584)|

| 0:27:32| Cindy Pionke, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| Cindy, will the biggest emphasis of this be getting sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| in our parental walking zones around our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| That's a very big piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| as well as trying to connect our public facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1665)|
| 0:27:49| things like ballparks, libraries, senior centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| and then if possible, like major retail centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| like where there's grocery stores and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| But basically that's what we're aiming to solve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| trying to find out where we should put our sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| do a selective job in terms of where they should actually be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1689)|
| 0:28:11| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| We have a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1693)|

| 0:28:20| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Thank you, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| On page 6, item number 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| is a resolution approving a right-of-way agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| with Norfolk Southern Railroad Company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| in the amount of $40,544 for roadway improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1710)|

| 0:28:42| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Mr. VanVate, can you explain what's going on here at this section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Certainly, Mr. Vice Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| Dwight VanVate, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| Mr. Chairman, you'll find we've divided our items up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| This is an agreement with Norfolk Southern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| that allows us to make improvements at the intersection of Depot and Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| Presently it comes in at a geometric skew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| There are issues with site distance and access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| It's a companion project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| and I would want to remind Commission that the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| or the rail crossing, grade crossing of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| at the railroad tracks is going to be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| So this will make improvements to the Depot Street access on Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| in order to provide continued good connectivity and better site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Proper motion is seconded before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Item number 36 is a resolution approving a contract with Rogers Group, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| for the provision of hot mix hauling, placement, sidewalk, and curbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| Resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1803)|
| 0:30:04| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Mr. Snowden or VanVate, one please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| I just want to brag on Rogers Group from last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| what they did on Tipton Station, some of the paving out in our area, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| They just about made it a racetrack out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| It's so smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| Just for information purposes, is asphalt staying steady?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Have you seen an incline, or is there anything that we need to look out for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Yeah, it's steadily going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Asphalt publishes a monthly average of the asphalt cement producers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| and this time last year in May of 2017, it's up about 16% from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1842)|
| 0:30:50| So that's why you'll see this contract versus last year is about the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| So asphalt is steadily going up and has for the past 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| So we'll still get to pave the same amount of roads, it just may cost us a little more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Chief, what is the current rate then that you're having to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1866)|
| 0:31:10| The current rate we're paying right now is about $76 a ton for D-Mix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| which is our most common mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| This contract I think is like $86 and something, so it went up about $10 a ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| Seeing no further lights on, we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Item number 38 is a resolution approving a memorandum of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| with the Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| for the development of a Hardin Valley mobility study in the amount of $147,600, resolution 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1901)|
| 0:31:50| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Yeah, Dwight or Cindy or whoever wants to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| I think we've had extensive conversations with some folks in the area that that's going to affect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| so do you want to kind of get us up to date on where we're at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1925)|
| 0:32:09| Essentially what we're hoping to do is a mobility study for the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| Essentially the area that's going to be studied is from I-75-40 out west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1935)|
| 0:32:22| to the Anderson County line to basically 200 to 300 feet east of the Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| as we take in the Tennessee Technology Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| And that's basically the whole area that we're looking at in terms of mobility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| As you know, growth has been tremendous out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| and what we're trying to do is figure out which existing roadways might need to be enhanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| if there are any possible new routes that need to be constructed that don't exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| We're also looking at opportunities for sidewalks, bicycles, and greenways as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| So this will also overlap some with the Sidewalk Master Plan that you just approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| because that's a chunk of it, but it's not the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| It's just Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Would it be possible to extend it to Reagan Road on the east side of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| Because that's kind of one of the—it's going to be affected by Terra Hala as well if it's extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| I'm not sure what that distance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| It's a mile maybe, less than a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| It's where Hardin Valley Church is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| But Reagan Road will be affected if you close off some of those side roads on the Pellissippi, which we hope to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| It's going to push a little bit of traffic down to Reagan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Does that make sense to you, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| It does make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| Would you put that in the study if it doesn't overextend the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Is this study going to be funded out of your FY19 budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| How long will the study take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| I believe this is nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| Nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| The reason I ask is because then we capture different traffic patterns during different seasons and different times of the year that are going to really impact long-term what this would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2056)|
| 0:34:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Some of the data that we've already talked to the consultant as we set up the contract, and they are not going to do any of their additional counts until after school is back in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2071)|
| 0:34:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| Seeing no floodlights on, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Item number 39 is approving a construction contract in the amount of $524,157.70 with Whaley Construction, LLC, for improvements to SR33 Merrill Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2096)|
| 0:35:08| including left and right turn lanes at I.C. King Park, Resolution 411.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| With a proper motion and a second, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2125)|
| 0:35:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I had a question regarding your traffic impacts and the impact of the construction of that area and how we're going to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| That's what my question was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| You want to address it to Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Yes, Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| The traffic control plan there does allow for two-way traffic at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| The shoulder on Merrill Park is kind of wide on both sides, so what we'll do is set up temporary concrete barrier rail, move them over to one side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2149)|
| 0:35:59| kind of narrow the lane slightly, build that section of road that's blocked off, and then move them over there and move the barrier rail again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| So there will always be – traffic will be able to go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| It may be a little bit tighter situation, but they will be able to traverse the area at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Seeing no more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| With a proper motion and a second, all in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| On page 7, item number 40 is a resolution authorizing submission of an application for the fiscal year 2018-2019 litter grant from the Tennessee Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2188)|
| 0:36:40| and if said application is approved, authorizing Knox County to enter into a grant contract for the acceptance of the grant award in an amount up to $169,000, resolution 412.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2200)|
| 0:36:53| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| Seeing no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| With a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| Do you want to talk about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I thought you might want to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| I did not pull this, but I'm pretty sure it's the same as last year was drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| This will be the litter grant for supplies, and the part of it will be going to KKB for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| This is Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| It is a yearly funding opportunity from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| It changes very little from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Basically, the total amount changes, and they tell us in the spring, and then they ask us before we actually make the application to get authorization from the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2261)|
| 0:37:52| From last year to this year, the funding has not changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| It's the exact same, both this item and then the next item, which was item 41, which is the 35% for the education for Keep Knoxville Beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2275)|
| 0:38:07| I would add that the education portion is bid out as an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| That's around $50,000 on that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| The 35% educational amount is roughly $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2298)|
| 0:38:27| Yeah, real close to $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| It funds a large portion of our litter removal activities, but we have supplemented that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2310)|
| 0:38:40| For example, in this year's budget, there was a request, and it was put in for three additional litter laborers, and we work with the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2320)|
| 0:38:50| We do charge off every penny to the grant before we use county money, but some of that money that comes from the state grant must be spent on education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2330)|
| 0:39:03| We're allowed to add more to education, but not less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| We're pretty proud of the partnership we have with Keep Knoxville Beautiful for the educational portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| While you're there, we'll give an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| I met with Judge Long and Attorney General Allen, and we're starting to see some more violations, probationers coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2356)|
| 0:39:29| It's slowly coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| We should see more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Hopefully, Drew and I are working on a couple other things as far as litter signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| Drew and Tom and I met with the law director, and we're tired of seeing We Buy Houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2379)|
| 0:39:49| Everywhere you go, there's We Buy Houses signs, and those are illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| People, those are totally illegal, and they look ugly, so we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| There are things that Solid Waste and I are working on, along with a couple of state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| Hopefully, right now, grass is about knee-high, so we don't see much litter, but wait until the fall of the year, and your phone will be ringing off the wall again, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2404)|
| 0:40:14| I appreciate Tom Salter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| He is not present tonight, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| I appreciate what Tom has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| We need to recognize Tom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| He's got one more meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Yes, he's set to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Set to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| We'll get with him, because Tom's done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| Yes, he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Thank you, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Congratulations, Dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Seeing no lights on with a proper motion and a second, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Item number 42 is a resolution approving a contract with Letco Group, LLC, doing business as Living Earth for Green Waste Recycling Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2441)|
| 0:40:51| at a cost of $28.90 per ton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| Resolution 414.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| And Dwight and I have already had a conversation about this, but I just wanted to make sure that the commissioners in all the districts were aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2467)|
| 0:41:16| The facility where they take this green waste to is off of Oak Ridge Highway at Joe Daniels Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2476)|
| 0:41:23| It used to be called Natural Resources Recovery or Nature Resources Recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| Well, and I'm a regular there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| I'm there probably once a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| But what they've done now is they've changed their fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| It used to be if you had a 5x8 trailer and you had it half full with brush and leaves and limbs, they'd charge you a flat fee of $5 to unload the trailer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2499)|
| 0:41:49| As of last week, that fee now has gone to $15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| And so what I'm concerned about is a lot of these homeowners who were used to just paying, you know, figuring, hey, it's $5, I'll get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2513)|
| 0:42:01| Now this brush is going to end up under the overpasses or on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| And, of course, the bad part is they're the only game in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| And this is that facility that used to be owned by Knox County for some of our newer commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| But anyways, I just want to let you know that they have changed their rules, and actually they're giving us a slight decrease over what the regular rate is for a dump truck load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2536)|
| 0:42:29| I'm just worried that people won't be using the facility as they have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2549)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| I guess Commissioner Schoonmaker brought up a question in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| This contract is for county trucks only, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| This is not for private, public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| Yes, sir. We don't regulate their transactions with regular citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| This is just for county generated material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| Okay. That's what I want to clear up to make sure that this is just the county only per ton and not for citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Yes, sir. And if I could just say a word of thanks to Karen Smitherman and Purchasing and to Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| This is actually the third solicitation we issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| The first solicitation they simply bid us the gate rate, the rate they're going to charge anybody through the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| And there's absolutely no advantage to Knox County into entering into a contract for gate rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| In addition, they had stipulations requiring exclusivity for our material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| And why we would pay gate rate and guarantee you exclusivity for our material seemed to be certainly lost on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2607)|
| 0:43:35| So we bid it again and got no responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| And we bid it a third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| And we got more favorable terms and more favorable pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| So I do appreciate procurement staying the course with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| Commissioner Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| Just for information purposes, you don't have any tons a year we may take out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2632)|
| 0:43:53| Highway maintenance and schools will be – I guess highway maintenance, schools, and parks will be the three biggest contributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2633)|
| 0:44:00| But we're all billed and invoiced separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Obviously, those accounts are all reconciled separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Other than spring storms, given that we don't have curbside brush and leaf pickup, we don't generate a whole lot of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| I just wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| There was an article actually for the public, and I don't know if this applies to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| but the zoo is actually looking for green waste, certain varieties of trees to feed their elephants and such animals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2658)|
| 0:44:26| Seeing no other lights on with a proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| In a second before us, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| Item number 43 is a resolution approving change order number one in the amount of $50,000 with Merritt Construction, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| for the renovation of the Carter Convenience Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| which change orders provide additional funding for rock exploration and undercoating of unsuitable soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| This is resolution 415.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| DeWine, I have one question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2695)|
| 0:45:03| Seeing how they found rock and they're having to do some grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| I know this plan called for pavers that were allowed to let water bleed through to keep us from having to put too big of a detention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| Will we still be able to do that once we've hit this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| As far as I know, there's been no change order that would address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| It's simply a matter of getting the excavation depth that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| We've got arguably one of our very best sets of hands out there as the project overseer, Mr. Ben White,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| and so a high level of competence in Ben's skills and ability, and he reports directly to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| So we think we'll get there, but we did hit rock, and it's just the way that construction works sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| But, no, sir, no change in terms of the pavers that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| This is the facility that we're renting the property from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| We have a 20-year lease with a first right of refusal to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| What is our total cost now that we've invested in this project so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| I don't want to speculate on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Let me see if Jim recollects that, Commissioner Skinmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| but I'd have to probably prefer to come back to you Monday with hard numbers than do it from memory, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I think the contract calls for about $950 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I want to think $931, but Jim may have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| $913.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| $913.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| I got my one and a three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| And another $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| So we're almost at a million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| And we actually had our high bid on the project I think was $1,000,001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| So the most responsive and also lowest bidder was actually about 11% below the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2801)|
| 0:46:49| So we were watching very closely to make sure we don't get changed order to death in order to creep it back up closer to the average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| Seeing no lights on and proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Okay, Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| Item number 46 is a resolution approving a contract with Gregory Holt Clark in the amount not to exceed $126,750| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| to provide Homeland Security consultant services for Homeland Security District 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| as part of the Complex Coordinated Terrorist Attacks Grant Program, Resolution 503.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Do you have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2848)|
| 0:47:29| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| I'm the one who pulled this off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| I guess something that is good news, I did a little bit of research on this, and I guess Holt is his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2853)|
| 0:47:41| and what I found that was interesting when reviewing his background is that he actually was the project manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| if you can clarify this, for the New York Police Department's counterterrorism securing the city exercise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| So I know he's got a back, has worked over at UT and done some consulting work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| but this is obviously a very important thing for the safety and security of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| So based on what I read, it looked like he was extremely qualified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| but I thought it would be relevant for the public and this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| if you could share just a little bit more about what we're doing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Rebecca Gibson, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Holt's bio is basically attached to this if you want to review it, to the proposal with RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| and Holt has a very extensive background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| He was actually over at Knoxville Emergency Management many, many years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| and he worked on a grant prior to, I believe it was weapons of mass destruction prior to Homeland Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| and he's done national training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| So Holt is very, very well-versed, but if you want to go into it, I have it here in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| but if you want to read it extensively, it is attached to the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| and we're very pleased he's coming on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| And if this is approved by a county commission, he will probably start sometime in early June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| So he will come into play at that point if approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| Is that all, Mr. Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Seeing no further lights on and the proper motion and second before us, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2949)|

| 0:49:37| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Seeing no lights on, having a proper motion and a second before us, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=2989)|

| 0:50:22| I'm the one who pulled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| I noticed that the state of Tennessee has a tuberculosis eradication project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| that's a major priority for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| And with this, I know we're focusing on the local community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| I think the state had 116 cases of TB last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| When I saw this, I was frankly, I was curious, how many cases did we have in Knox County this past year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3042)|
| 0:50:49| I was just really frankly curious how big a problem this was for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3052)|

| 0:50:57| Thank you, Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| The TB program, this grant is part of the larger state TB elimination program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3059)|
| 0:51:05| So we fall, every county has a TB elimination program that's paid for through this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| This funding also covers, we actually operate the regional TB program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| so we get funding from the state to also cover the 15 counties that surround Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3076)|
| 0:51:22| The state health department has some employees that work with us on doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| So we're covering not just Knox County, but the 15 counties that surround us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| And in Knox County, we average about six cases of active TB a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| We'll be as high as 11 one year, and like last year, we only had four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| So it just varies quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| And this pays for their medication, their testing that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3105)|
| 0:51:50| pays for our staff who go out and we do what's called directly observed therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| So if you have tuberculosis, we don't just bring your pills to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| we bring your pills to you and watch you swallow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| That really increases compliance, and so people get better from TB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| and we don't have outbreaks of TB, which is really cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| It's actually done across the country, not just in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| This includes several staff members and is a noncompetitive ongoing grant that we've had for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3130)|
| 0:52:18| Seeing no lights on, we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3138)|

| 0:52:35| with the State of Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| for the provision of pre-arrest diversion infrastructure for the Behavioral Urgent Health Care Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| which amendment increases the maximum liability for the state under the contract by $726,850,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| decreases the local match requirement, and extends the term of the contract by one year to expire June 30, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3173)|
| 0:53:00| This is Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3180)|

| 0:53:08| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| How much does this reduce the local match by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| Or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| For us, it's 8%, so it lowered it from 33% down to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| That number, I don't have it off of my head, but 8% is the amount that it lowered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3201)|
| 0:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3206)|

| 0:54:52| It's kind of new to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3292)|

| 0:56:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| Not very often do we have some good moves that happen like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3376)|
| 0:56:23| Mrs. Carver was one of the original members of the Frank Strange Senior Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| when it was first opened in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| In fact, she actually helped at the front desk before the county could actually provide funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| to have someone as a receptionist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| She was also very instrumental in starting the Spanish Club and the book club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3401)|
| 0:56:49| and also started the lending library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| She was actually known to actually be at the Strange Center every day until she got ill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| but she was one of the avid Canasta players and Scrabble players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| To have someone's estate give to the Strange Center the $130,000 is pretty remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3425)|
| 0:57:16| As we move forward with a new location for a senior center in West Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| we will be looking forward to dedicating something in that new facility with her name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3441)|
| 0:57:33| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Yes, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Was there any specifics how the money was to be spent in certain programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3456)|
| 0:57:43| No, not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| So how is that deposited for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| How is that money deposited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| It goes into the Strange account at this time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| But does that replace monies that are in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| or will that increase that account of $130,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| Just say yes, Chris, and then turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| Is there any creative bookkeeping going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| All we'll do is it's a legal restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| so we'll deposit the money and just do it as a restricted fund balance amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| until we decide what to spend it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| So it's just kind of restricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| So who will decide how it's spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| I think what would happen is my anticipation would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| that the mayor would probably do it as we locate to a new Strange Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| and then I'd say do it from there and then go to the commission for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| Seeing no more lights on, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3528)|

| 0:59:17| Don, you wanted to pull it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| Yeah, I was just kind of, I mean, I'm not against this proposal or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| I was just kind of wondering on the timing of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| with the legislature being out of session and something like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| and then what was the original bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| I'll give you the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| 1993, I knew it because of the year before I got to the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| it was our friends in the tobacco industry gave all the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3580)|
| 0:59:46| of any tobacco regulation to the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| and oddly enough, any bill that dealt with tobacco went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| I believe it was the Agriculture Subcommittee, which, oddly enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| the tobacco lobby had a very strong influence in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| I know that might come as a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| So the way it was sold to the legislature was not quite the way it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| and I know that, I remember Wayne Ritchie fought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| when he was in the State House, and I'm on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| because that's the first time most of them had seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| and basically what it did was it took local municipalities and cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| out of the equation where they could not regulate tobacco use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| whereas the state of Tennessee could come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| you can have smoking, and then it took us out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| So this was just, we'd been trying to get the legislature to do something about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| and we'd hoped that the legislation would have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| and once again, I believe it would be studied over the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| but I think it's about time for some of us small government people to realize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| and we had hoped that they would pass it, but obviously they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| Okay, so it's already an existing bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Yeah, every year it is, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Okay, okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3661)|
| 1:01:04| Do we have, is it sponsored by somebody in our delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| It has in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| I think Representative Brooks has carried it in the past, and others have too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| but I think we need to reiterate that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Mr. Mayor, just for, kind of got me wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| I think I'll quit asking questions because they're making me wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| So if we put no smoking on the city-county building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| that cannot be regulated by this body or anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| Well, they have the right, I believe, I'll maybe look at my law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| but I believe the state has overriding ability with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| and as of late, though, the smoking laws have gotten more favorable towards the nonsmokers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| but Martha can help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| But I believe that is pretty much the way it is, Martha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| Under the Nonsmokers Protection Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| all buildings that are all places that have employees of 50 or greater must be smoke-free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3728)|
| 1:02:16| including the outside radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| That's a state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| So when the state passed that law, that's why our restaurants are smoke-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| If you're not going to be smoke-free, you have to be 18 and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| So that includes the city-county building and other buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| must be smoke-free if they have 50 employees or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| and that includes a certain distance from the front door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| and that's why we can post nonsmoking signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| I know that I watched on the legislative channel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| where Dr. Briggs was arguing about smoking in cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| and his parents smoking with kids in cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| I'm not sure how it turned out, if it passed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3768)|
| 1:02:52| That bill got defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| It got defeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3787)|
| 1:03:08| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| Item number 67 is a resolution renaming the PetSafe Dog Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| at Tommy Shumpert Park the PetSafe Emma Jane Walker Memorial Dog Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| Yeah, I was going to recognize Mayor Burchett there, if he wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| I appreciate Commissioner Carringer, Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| Commissioner Carringer bringing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I talked to Randy Boyd last week, or maybe a couple weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| and he didn't have any problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| I said, check with your attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| He called me back within an hour, and that's where we got to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| I appreciate Commissioner Carringer bringing this very timely piece of legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| Very sad thing, but I'm glad she did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I think everybody on commission knows about Emma Jane Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3848)|
| 1:04:14| Having it at Tommy Shumpert Park is actually over in the area where she lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| and where her family still resides in the Sturkey area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| She went to Sturkey Elementary in Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Her mom teaches at Sturkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Her parents and her family are very thankful that we are going to do this in honor of Emma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3869)|
| 1:04:39| They had a lot of happy times and memories over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| because Emma was a lover of animals at that dog park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| and that's also Central's home field for baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| She still has a brother that has two more years at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| Mayor Burchett and I would very much appreciate being able to have just a small part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| in making this happen for the Walker family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3905)|
| 1:05:13| Seeing no lights on, we have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3919)|

| 1:05:28| from the Hotel Motel Tax Fund for the Big Ears Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| This is 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| We have three people that wish to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| I have Nick, Ashley, and Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| You guys want to come on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| Just give your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3952)|
| 1:05:57| Rick Dover, Dover Development, 530 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| Hello, I'm Nick Cazana with the Tennessean Hotel and the Holiday Inn Hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| I'm Ashley Capps with Big Ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| All right, I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Thank you, Commissioner, for hearing us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I wanted to just come down and speak in support of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| I think it's a good thing and appropriate, and I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| We recently opened a new hotel, the Hyatt Place Hotel, 165 rooms at the corner of Gay and Clinch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3988)|
| 1:06:35| and the old Farragut building that had been dark for about 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| I can speak to what happened just in the four days that Bonnaroo happened, our incremental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| Big Ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| I'm sorry, Big Ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| Wrong festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| The Big Ears happened in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| It was so great, and we had people really from all over the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4011)|
| 1:06:55| and international people staying at the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| The hotel was 100% occupied all that time, the first time we had hit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| and I looked at the incremental increase on the day before and the day after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| The amount of revenue that we had just attributable to Bonnaroo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| just the marginal increase, was over $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| You can do the math on the occupancy tax related to hotels and motels for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| and see just what our one little building contributed on those four days to the coppers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| More important than that, I think we're seeing people come and experience Knox County in a whole new way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| As everybody knows, downtown Knoxville is downtown Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| People are here from everywhere, and they absolutely are loving the experience they're having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| both from the music and then also just to be in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| They're supporting our restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| They're going to these venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| They're having a wonderful time, and I just think it's just such a great festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| and just such a great event for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| So I think I just wanted to let you know how much I support Big Ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| and I think this request is something that I hope that you will consider in a positive light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4088)|
| 1:08:12| Rick just about covered everything but just a few more statistics in the three years that Big Ears have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| Unfortunately, well, fortunately at the Holiday Inn in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| and we had already booked some conventions ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| but in 2016 we had 108 rooms from Big Ears, and then 2018 we had 208 rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4105)|
| 1:08:33| So it just literally doubled, and our hotel also was full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| We estimated that we generated over $4,000 worth of hotel-motel tax just from Big Ears over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4117)|
| 1:08:45| So you multiply that times the number of hotels we have downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| that just about takes care of the $25,000 request that Big Ears has proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4129)|
| 1:08:56| Add to that sales tax, it's pretty important to both the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| I would like to add one other thing while we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| The average daily rate in downtown Knoxville has only improved a small percentage over the last year or the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4147)|
| 1:09:15| Same thing for occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4155)|
| 1:09:17| So more events, the more events that we can have like Big Ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| and the more support we can get from the county and the city bringing things to downtown Knoxville is so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4161)|
| 1:09:28| We've got over 600 new rooms coming to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| That's a lot of rooms, and considering we don't have a big influx of businesses downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| we really need your help in supporting whatever request the developers would like to have, the promoters I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4177)|
| 1:09:44| Thank you very much for your time and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| To give just a little bit of background on the nature of this request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| Big Ears was launched in 2009, and we held the festival for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| and then for a variety of reasons took three years off and came back in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| When it came back, it came back with a bang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| The press that we found ourselves getting, not just nationally but internationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| and it was press not just about the festival but about the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| The experience of actually coming to the festival quickly made us realize that we had a real tiger by the tail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| and in determining what was the best way to grow the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| and really capture this opportunity for, frankly, our entire region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| we became a 501c3 a little over two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| and I've started looking for ways to really grow and sustain the festival as a community event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4249)|
| 1:10:56| So we do host concerts, but beyond that, there are numerous free community events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| at the Knoxville Museum of Art, on Market Square, throughout the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| We're engaging all sorts of other arts organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| The Knoxville Symphony Orchestra is a part of it, the Knoxville Jazz Orchestra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| the University of Tennessee, the Museum of Art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| and then beyond that, working with many educational groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| the Joy Music School, the Community School for the Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| This year, we had special programs for Big Brothers, Big Sisters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| and all of which just speaks to an enormous growing opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| and the real nature of this request is we're looking to build the network of community support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4300)|
| 1:11:47| so that we can really seize what I think is a very, very special and rare opportunity for any community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| and we now have it at our fingertips, and we want to see what we can make of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4316)|
| 1:12:05| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Gale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| I've attended Big Ears, and you've answered my question about the allocation request of $25,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| so I assume that we want to connect the level of music that Big Ears provide throughout the entire city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4336)|
| 1:12:26| and have a coordinated event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Are we going to work with Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| I know we work with the Joy Music School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| but what other efforts to diversify Big Ears that needs to come to the city as we begin to look at this request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4353)|
| 1:12:44| Expanding the educational programs and the opportunities for young people to hear many of these amazing artists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4364)|
| 1:12:53| that are coming from all over the world is probably our number one goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| and in the past, we've only had the resources to open the doors for people who could come down to experience the music here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4378)|
| 1:13:08| so we've had open rehearsals, access to concerts, some workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| There's been a variety of different kinds of experiences that we have opened up for students of all kinds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4394)|
| 1:13:21| but now we want to look for opportunities to actually take it into the schools themselves as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| But we have so many different ways of outreach into not just Knoxville and Knox County, but the region as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4408)|
| 1:13:38| that we're eager to explore in the coming years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| It's a really exciting thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| I need clarification on where the $25,000 is going, and are we opening up a Pandora's box?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4430)|
| 1:13:57| Who's the next person in line that's going to come and want $25,000 or $50,000 at a hotel motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| So first of all, where are you going to use the $25,000 for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| Well, it goes into the general fund to support the programs as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4447)|
| 1:14:12| but this has been part of an ongoing conversation that goes back actually before even last year's festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4452)|
| 1:14:22| that we've had with the county, the city, and various other funders in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| as well as with the Tennessee Arts Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| So we are looking to build a general network of support, and we're being very successful at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| The reason we come to you looking for money from this particular funding source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4480)|
| 1:14:46| is because we're literally bringing thousands of people to town who are staying in hotels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| usually for four or five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| They're living in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| They're going to all of the restaurants, and they're having a tremendous economic impact on the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4499)|
| 1:15:07| which is what Rick and Nick wanted to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| But it's not just like a one-night or two-night visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| Most of these visitors are coming in on Wednesday or Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| They're leaving on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Some of the artists even come in for longer periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| We had a couple of artists that were here for a couple of weeks with their ensembles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| rehearsing for the festival this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| So there's a tremendous economic impact that adds to the coffers of the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4531)|
| 1:15:39| Yeah, I believe we can say that about the USA Cycling, the Bassmasters coming up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| I'm still kind of concerned about why wouldn't this go through Visit Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| Why wouldn't Visit Knoxville be funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| That's where most of the motel-hotel tax goes, comes from, is through Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| Am I incorrect on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| You know, my concern is—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Forty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Forty percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| I think it's 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| You know, that there, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| I'm not sure how I'll vote next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| I want to look into it more, but I'm kind of concerned who's going to be coming up next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| wanting $25,000 or $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| Well, if they're having a similar impact, I think they should get serious consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| Well, that's something hopefully in the next week we can discuss and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| So I'm kind of concerned about it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| One of the reasons why I wanted to put this up for us to consider is I'm putting my old hotelier hat back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4591)|
| 1:16:39| Prior to service in this community, I worked for 15 years for the Walt Disney Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| And what made this event stand out in my mind was its ability to drive incremental room nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4604)|
| 1:16:51| and visitations and business to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| And it struck me as exactly what we should be doing with the Hotel Motel Tax Fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| which is its mission is to reinvest in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| To my friend, Commissioner Daley's concerns, I'm sure that if we need to talk to our partners at Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4623)|
| 1:17:10| then I'm sure that they would probably be in support of this particular initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| to once again drive incremental room nights and economic activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| Ultimately for me, it was like, well, this really is sort of what this Hotel Motel Tax is for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| and I'll be happy to sponsor the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| So that to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| And if we want to get feedback from Visit Knoxville, I would be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| I'm quite confident that they would be in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| This question really is for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| In your analysis to the Audit Committee earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| you gave a composite projection for the Hotel Motel Tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| Is that where this funding, if approved, would come out of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| Yeah, we would take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| What we would prefer to do is charge it to the Hotel Motel Tax Fund and see how we end the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4682)|
| 1:18:10| and lessen the amount that we would hopefully add to fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| or if need be, take it from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| But I think that fund would probably close in the positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| So that's where it would probably go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| That is what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| It would be definitely this year and not delayed for next year then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Correct. I would prefer it in 2018, not 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| Okay. And then didn't our partners with the City of Knoxville make a matching donation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| They did, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| We've had these discussions for quite some time now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| and so one of the things that we would probably do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| I think we would probably start a new defined service contract process a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| So we would encourage them to try to get in that as they go forward, which makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4733)|
| 1:19:02| That's just kind of where that is, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| Okay. Thank you, sir. Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I think that, Chris, this is kind of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| I'm well aware sitting on the Board of Visit Knoxville how successful this event is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| and has been for the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4756)|
| 1:19:19| but this is out of the norm for us as a county to be outside a services contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| and be outside of a Visit Knoxville discussion with no measurables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| In the resolution, there's no measurables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| This is just a $25 transfer of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4775)|
| 1:19:40| In every other defined services contract that we have with, say, Dogwood Arts or whoever else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| there's measurables or there's requirements for those, and it's not just into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| So I think we had this conversation about three or four months ago about running this through Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| and I don't know where the – does Visit Knoxville –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| Mr. Capps, does Visit Knoxville provide services during the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| is there anything, contracted services you have with Visit already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| Yes. We work with Visit Knoxville on a variety of projects during the festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| including there's press conferences for a lot of the visiting journalists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4811)|
| 1:20:18| We've had a food court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| Does Visit pay for any of that, or is that something that you just coordinate with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Yes. They have supported us in a variety of ways for various programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| partly for the film festival and all of those various programs that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| Okay. I think the concern a little bit is just the resolution is so bland, and there's no –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| I mean, it doesn't stop somebody else from saying I've got a great festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| and if what you say is correct, if they have a great festival, let's help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| But this is outside of the norm for our services contracts in the budget year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| and it's also outside of the norm for tourism stuff to come to us and not go through Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| So I think that's the reason there's questions today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| I don't think anybody up here doesn't support big ears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| and think it's been a hugely successful event and will continue to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| And $25,000 is easy for me. I just wish we would stay with our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| So, I mean, I would love to see something on this resolution that says what this money goes for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| if it's educational outreach or if this money goes straight to the Joy to Music program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| I'm good with all that. I just don't like a give me $25,000 because it goes to my general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| I think we need to have some kind of where this money goes to inside the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| Well, I probably should have been more specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| but the money that we asked for this year actually made possible the free community programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4903)|
| 1:21:49| that we would otherwise have not been able to bring to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| I would love for that to be in the resolution as we move forward in the contracted services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| I'd love for that to be in there because, again, this is out of the norm for us on two different occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| and I don't want us to set a standard of giving away money just because it may be the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| but we need to have a reason for doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| I love what Commissioner Andrews said because I believe the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| I think we're opening up a Pandora's box if we don't define what this $25,000 is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| You still did not answer the question, how much did the visit to Knoxville give you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Did they give you any monetary value, monetary, for big ears?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| Kim here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| I believe that the money that they gave us this year total was $60,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| and what the money that they gave us went for, we used the Knoxville Visitor's Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4973)|
| 1:23:00| which we programmed throughout the weekend for a variety of free programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| taking the Blue Plate special concept and bringing in banjo player Bela Fleck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4985)|
| 1:23:12| Jerry Douglas from the Allison Krauss Group, and others did special concerts that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| We created the food court out in the area next to that to make the location more of a magnet for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=4998)|
| 1:23:28| It supported the film program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| and then we had a fiddler's jam, arguably like a fiddler's convention, out on the Market Square Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5011)|
| 1:23:42| and there was square dancing, there were jam sessions down in the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| and then we had four days of programming at the Knoxville Museum of Art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| that was free to the general public and to families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| much of it specifically focused on involving kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| as was some of the programming at the Knoxville Visitor's Center, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| There were some really great children's programs, actually, from some of the musicians that were in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| I think it was a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| I didn't get to attend, but I did attend the luncheon that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| We're talking about $85,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| If it's defined that that $25,000 will go for programs in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| or for the Museum of Art or whatever, I have no problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| but just handing over $25,000 without a defined area where it's going, I do have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| Our books are pretty open as far as where the money is going, so we can easily define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5076)|
| 1:24:47| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| One way that we could fix this is rather than a directed appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| it can't be additional pass-through monies through Visit Knoxville for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| so we can modify the request there, just if that would be acceptable to Mr. Capps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| It could be just an incremental pass-through through Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| How about this year we just make a motion or amend the resolution to where this $25,000 is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5107)|
| 1:25:16| This is already spent money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| It was already in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| We started the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| Well, like I said, we started the initial conversations back in the spring of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| and then for a variety of reasons, we're late getting to the table at the first of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| so that's why we're here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| We actually had it in our budget for the coming year, I mean for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| It makes it more difficult on this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| but moving forward it needs to be defined, or in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| it needs to be defined as to what money is being spent on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| and it has to have maybe an educational component to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5156)|
| 1:26:02| It's a slippery slope a little bit, and if you want to pass it through through BK, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| but it's easy to sow the results, but it's procedures where we need to make sure we're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5166)|
| 1:26:18| Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5180)|
| 1:26:21| Is it possible that we let the sponsor of this resolution have this next few days to work on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5181)|
| 1:26:28| and then re-present this back to us next Tuesday and just send it forward without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5188)|
| 1:26:36| Yeah, but depending on how big of a change that was made to it, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| As long as you have it for your, you know, to be passed out for Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| it can be added if it's a great new form, but you've already got it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| You've made a motion to send without recommendation based upon an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| so if you'll come with an amendment to the resolution, you can vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Commissioner Giddens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I support the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| I think we need to add the measurables of the connection to the education component that needs to just be filled in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5227)|
| 1:27:14| which is what we initially began this discussion over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| I think we are all, we all understand, if we do not, the economic impact of big ears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| but I think the biggest measurable piece is the coordinated connection with the educational component that needs to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5244)|
| 1:27:35| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| I rise to speak only because I've been here several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| and I can remember years gone by that we've had expenditures by commission that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5263)|
| 1:27:51| at the end of the day, we didn't know really what we were getting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| and it took several iterations of policy building to come up with where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5275)|
| 1:28:04| and that means that you apply at a certain time, you get grants at certain times, and they comply with measurables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5284)|
| 1:28:15| I hate to say that we're, I do not want us to be reacting to a reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5295)|
| 1:28:24| I would like to see commission have a policy in place that, if you'll remember back a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5304)|
| 1:28:32| I said maybe we need to invest more in deliverables by those people that were receiving money in tourism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5312)|
| 1:28:43| on the tourism side of the scheme, and I used James White Ford as my example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| and from that we have a policy whereby the administration, the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5329)|
| 1:28:57| presents us an annual budget of a certain pot divided up in a certain manner to advance the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5337)|
| 1:29:08| and then to arrive, for someone to arrive today and ask for money that's outside the pot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5348)|
| 1:29:16| sort of leaves those people that went by the process over the last 12 months out in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5356)|
| 1:29:24| I'm not saying this is a bad investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| I'm saying we've worked a long, diligent path of getting to the policy that we've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| and it may be that we need to stick to the policy because of what's going to happen next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5375)|
| 1:29:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5383)|

| 1:30:32| We'll need to fix the MOU or the resolution to make sure that it's targeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5432)|
| 1:30:39| and make sure that we get it right next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| We'll come back Monday or Tuesday and try to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5442)|

| 1:31:25| I'll make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| This is another ad, I guess, late ad to the agenda that hasn't been read yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5487)|
| 1:31:33| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5493)|

| 1:31:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5504)|
| 1:31:48| Item number 71 is consideration of the closure of a portion of Twin Oak Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| as per the concept plan approved by MPC in May 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5520)|
| 1:32:13| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| What was the year delay on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| Anybody have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| This is a closure from a certain point on Twin Oaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| where the landowner on both sides of the road is the same person now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| and it is a long, drawn-out subdivision development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| This is Campbell Engineering, and they're just now getting to platting the place out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| And all of the real estate in this closure is owned by the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5571)|
| 1:33:01| Sir, did you wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| My name is Robert Knight, 3425 Bellevue Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| I'm an engineer for AT&T out of Parkside Drive and responsible for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| This came to me this morning in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| We still have facilities in a pole line in existence on that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| We've not had a request to remove our facilities or our poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| Those are capital investments on that right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5607)|
| 1:33:38| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| Yeah, we do send letters out to all the affected utility owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| and give them the right of retaining an easement for the existing facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| prior to that property being transferred to the landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| So your facilities will be able to remain or be coordinated with the landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| That's what I needed to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Was this the first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5640)|
| 1:34:04| We had one last month that was similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| This is a first reading on this one also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| This doesn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| It doesn't say if it's first or second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| You remember last month I think it was we had one and the lady was here to contest it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| and then she left because the developer told her what was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| I just wondered if this was the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| It may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5667)|
| 1:34:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5678)|
| 1:34:39| This is a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| What's the time frame to notify, I guess it's AT&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5682)|
| 1:34:47| and if it wasn't a single property owner then what would be the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5687)|
| 1:34:58| So if AT&T says we're not moving or want more than one property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| what kind of time frame do we look at which goes to first or second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| I'm just asking the question because I'm unfamiliar with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| Mr. Chair, let us back up to the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| This is a single reading closure as opposed to a two reading closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5716)|
| 1:35:24| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| No, I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| To my understanding it should require two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| The road closure would require two readings of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| Mr. Chairman, I would withdraw my motion and make a new motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| that I move that this first reading of this road closure be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5741)|
| 1:35:51| Is that agreeable with the seconder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| Who made the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| This being first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5755)|
| 1:35:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| Now then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| I have a question, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| The second question is over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Are you going to be able to work this out with AT&T?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| If AT&T does have to relocate their facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| that would be the responsibility of the developer to coordinate with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| So AT&T should be taken care of by the developer should the need occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5780)|
| 1:36:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| So the county has no liability if we pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| and AT&T is not happy, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| We send letters to them, water facilities, electric facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| If any utilities want to retain an easement, they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| and it would be the owner's responsibility to satisfy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| We have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| To approve this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| All in favor say, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Just for clarification, that was Raindrop Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| It was first reading last month and also an alley closure on Olive Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| So it was not the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5831)|
| 1:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| We have a motion to approve on first reading and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5841)|

| 1:37:49| Item number 75 is discussion item regarding internal school funds audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5869)|
| 1:38:00| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| Is there someone from the schools that I could speak to this issue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5886)|
| 1:38:22| Garrett Raiden, Knox County Schools, supervisor of internal school funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| Let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| How many SSOs are there in the school system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| School support organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Approximately 210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| 210.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| And these, by state statute, are supposed to be approved every year by the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5918)|
| 1:38:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| Per STALT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Per state law, they have to be approved every year with the Board of Education's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| And I'm the director of schools designee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| So I approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| So you approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| So how many have you approved this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Approximately 40 for the 17-18 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| Approximately 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| So you've only approved 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Out of 210?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| And these are supposed to be approved every year as an audit to make sure that they're still existing and still operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5954)|
| 1:39:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| So we only have 40 of those that are approved to still operate, but they're still existing in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5963)|
| 1:39:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| And that's a major finding in the audits, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| It's one of the findings, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| So what can we do to correct this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Since taking this job on, I used to work, I guess I should name credentials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| Garrett Raiden, Knox County Schools, School and Term Service Funds, 912 Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| I'll put that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5989)|
| 1:39:50| My previous job was PCBAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| I did the audit for Knox County, Knox County Schools, and the School and Term Service Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| Upon taking this position, one of my goals was to get that established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=5997)|
| 1:40:03| That was a law that was created, I believe, in 2011, and it kind of goes unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6003)|
| 1:40:11| But I guess I should say that we've all had students or family members that are a part of an athletic club, a booster club, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6011)|
| 1:40:20| And usually those are mom-and-pop organizations where they actually are businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| And the reason that they are businesses is the reason this law was created, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6025)|
| 1:40:31| is to make sure that the revenue was lining up with what they were telling the state and what the school system was being told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6031)|
| 1:40:39| So my job comes in to say that a booster club does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| The principal does want it to exist because I don't oversee that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6043)|
| 1:40:49| If a principal is in front of me, they would say, Garrett, we want this booster club to exist at our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| I would then approve that organization based on the criteria set forth by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| It's various things, mainly that I'll mention those briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| A written agreement, an annual report that would mention the officers within the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| That gives me details about are there any conflict of interests, you know, a treasurer being a bookkeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| You know, that would be a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| And from there, we're not required by state law, the Board of Education is not, and myself as designee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| we're not required to audit those books, and nor are our external auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| So in my tenure, we've turned over a few to the comptroller's office for review based on any number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6094)|
| 1:41:42| But does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| So basically what you're doing is you're turning in, say they raised like $10,000 for this one SSO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| and since they're not approved, and that money disappears, and somebody asks about it, who's responsible for that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6114)|
| 1:42:03| The school support organization is responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| If they're properly approved, and how we structure this, I guess I should emphasize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| If they're not approved is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| Yeah, well, if they're not approved, then we wouldn't know they exist, theoretically, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| If they're not approved, then they don't exist in that school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Again, three years ago since taking this job, we've done a really good job the first year, and that would be 15-16, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6139)|
| 1:42:28| At the time, 190-something were SSOs, and 96 were properly approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6148)|
| 1:42:35| And it's went down, but we've trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| A lot of that may just be word of mouth, not getting around that it's an annual renewal, not just one time and you're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6157)|
| 1:42:48| So we are training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| We're doing our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| So it is a concern of mine, so who do we need to say this needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6170)|
| 1:42:58| Actually, the Board of Education actually had the same question and comment around the time of our audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6178)|
| 1:43:07| when it was released back in, I believe, December, January, sometime around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| And I believe it's going to become part of their evaluation criteria that every audit finding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| and when I say they, it's part of their retirement, it'll be the principal's evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| So I know that was one of the Board of Education's questions and suggestions to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| was to make them at some point live up to some kind of standard or policy, which is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| So make them be required and it be in their evaluation that they're not getting them properly approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6221)|
| 1:43:48| Now, a lot of them are showing due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| They'll say pending, and I didn't mention that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| And it's about 50 more, so we're still around the 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| And the pending could be they've sent some paperwork but not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6237)|
| 1:44:03| And so that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Thank you, Mr. Radin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| I just wanted to clear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| Mr. Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| I think it's worth pointing out that these are not taxpayer monies that are usually in these SSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| That is correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| These are fundraising dollars, donations given to, I mean, basically what they are, 501c3 or nonprofit, which there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6257)|
| 1:44:27| So it's one of those two typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| You could be any number of a business, but that would be the main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| And I do know how hard you have been working on getting this going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| You and I have had many discussions about liabilities with these entities, and I appreciate the work you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Hey, Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6286)|
| 1:44:47| So just is the principal responsible for notifying you that he wants to have this SSO approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6287)|
| 1:44:56| How is that actually structured then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| And I've tried this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| I've actually taken a different approach to it this coming school year I'm going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| mainly just because the principals have a lot to deal with and the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| So what I've just asked is I've put the list out on our Knox County Schools website, so knoxschools.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| And just for reference, the website is knoxschools.org forward slash SSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| And the approved organizations are mentioned there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| And if they could just print that and basically how we'll do it next year is print it and say yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| that they agree that it's still in existence or they want it to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| So that would be how they would do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| So like in my case in the Farragut High School, in other words, the football booster club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6338)|
| 1:45:44| the baseball booster club, the soccer club, the lacrosse club, and the marching band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| those entities would already be approved, but you may not have something from, say, the robotics club or the whatever club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6349)|
| 1:45:58| Yeah, that would be a great example, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| Just off the top of my head, any school may have between one and 15, 16 SSOs within the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6362)|
| 1:46:09| And then some schools have one that govern all of them at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| So it's a whole lot more efficient just to get the paperwork done once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| But, again, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6382)|
| 1:46:23| I was a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| So Knox County Schools doesn't actually have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| And I'm on your website to look at ones that are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| You have a no status, which is not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| But give me an example of a denied fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| I want to first – you have a policy or you do not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6401)|
| 1:46:42| I was going to ask you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Yes, we do actually have a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| It's in the fiscal management section for school support organizations, and it discusses everything we're talking about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6404)|
| 1:46:54| And give me an example of a denied fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| So a denied fundraiser would be any number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| It could be that there's another fundraiser that's district-wide that's going on during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| So, example, Bearden High School – sorry to pick on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| Bearden High School is wanting to do a cookie dough fundraiser during coupon book season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| Those contradict each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6434)|
| 1:47:15| They're both fundraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| We're asking parents to donate to two different causes when the district-wide fundraiser would trump that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6436)|
| 1:47:23| And so that would be a denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Another example is it's been sent to me without the principal's approval, and so that hierarchy is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6444)|
| 1:47:31| The principal still governs that does-it-exist mentality, and then I would look at it from a district perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| It's very similar to how we do fundraising in general in the internals side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| While you're talking about it, I had to point out that item number 21 on our agenda was where we approved the acceptance from six of these organizations for our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6471)|
| 1:48:01| just as an example while we're talking about these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6489)|
| 1:48:10| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| Item number 76 is a discussion item regarding litigation tax and how it's being used for the courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6494)|
| 1:48:23| Vice Chair Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| Some time ago there was a litigation tax passed for Knox County, and it's adopted by a resolution of, I guess, what, two-thirds of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6507)|
| 1:48:36| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6516)|
| 1:48:37| Yes, two-thirds of the commission majority vote for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| and this is to assess a privilege tax on litigation in the courts in the case not to exceed $100 per case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6521)|
| 1:48:50| and is used exclusively for the construction of building the house legal proceedings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6530)|
| 1:48:59| offices directly involved with the court system, and the renovation of the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6539)|
| 1:49:06| Does ours read a little bit different than that as far as litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| Do you know, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6554)|
| 1:49:15| The law that I see that's on the state level here, it says this $100 per case is to be used exclusively for construction of building the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6555)|
| 1:49:26| legal proceedings, offices directly involved with the court system, and the renovation of the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6566)|
| 1:49:34| The amendment TCA code titled 67 Chapter 4, I think some of that money that we have, we get two different courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6574)|
| 1:49:42| and they run about, let's see, I see Mr. Hammond back there, I think they run about $800,000 from his section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6582)|
| 1:49:52| and $800,000 for Ms. Quest's section, so it's almost $2 million a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6592)|
| 1:50:00| and some of that money goes to paid debt is what I think we used it for, and some of that money goes to the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6600)|
| 1:50:11| and my question was how does that money, what kind of debt was that being paid on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6611)|
| 1:50:19| Is there a specific debt it's supposed to go for, or is it just throw it out there and say we're going to pay a little bit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6619)|
| 1:50:25| we're going to pay a little bit there, but do we have, are supposed to have specific projects that we pay the debt off with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6625)|
| 1:50:37| Now one other thing too I want to mention about this litigation tax, some of the, say if you have a problem with your neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6637)|
| 1:50:46| and you want to file a litigation against that neighbor and say it's over $150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| well it's going to cost you another $100 with this tax on there, so it's been on there before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6652)|
| 1:50:58| so it denies some of the people that want to bring a litigation against the neighbor for a small amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6658)|
| 1:51:05| so it's just not worth it, but this money as I understood is supposed to be used in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| Now I know under what we call an ordinance, we use half of that money to pay bills in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6671)|
| 1:51:21| and that's by ordinance by this county commission, and I just wanted to bring that to your all's attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| and Mr. Hammer was good enough to give me the figures on that, and it does run about $888,000, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6689)|
| 1:51:42| Yes, Commissioner, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| It was brought to my attention that my name was on the ordinance back in 2008 when I was on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| I'll be happy to provide commission with a brief history of how we got to that point if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Okay, well great. Thank you for the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| In 2008 the state legislature passed a state law which allowed the counties to implement an extra $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6719)|
| 1:52:07| I know that you had mentioned $100. If they've changed it, we can charge $100, we'll do that, but at that time it was $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| And so the law was very specific in terms of how it could be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| $25 was to go for courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| The other $25, as the state law read at that time, could be used for debt, it could be used for construction, that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6740)|
| 1:52:30| And so we asked the law director at the time to give us the opinion as to whether or not that money could be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| the extra $25, since we knew $25 was earmarked for courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| If the other $25 could be used for school debt because of the word debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| Now at that time the law director said yes, and at that time we were trying to build the Hardin Valley High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| And so it was the feeling on the commission at the time that that money could be used to help relieve some of the school debt at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6773)|
| 1:53:02| Now we were told by the law director that it could be revisited at any time, that $25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6782)|
| 1:53:07| and the commission at its discretion could earmark the money for something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| So the ordinance was drafted by the law department, it was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6792)|
| 1:53:15| and since then the money has gone, $25 for courthouse security, $25 has gone for school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6795)|
| 1:53:23| And yes, $800 and some thousand dollars was collected by our office just in the last calendar year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| and I believe $2 million total because money has come from juvenile, from chancery, from circuit, and from the criminal court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6810)|
| 1:53:38| So all the courts are collecting this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| But you're correct, if you go into court, these litigation taxes are added onto whatever your case may end up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6820)|
| 1:53:51| Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| I just wanted to make sure that we were spending it in the way it's supposed to be and was written, I guess, at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6832)|
| 1:54:02| And I understand about building the Hardin Valley, and I understand we're still paying on that school, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| Mr. Hammond, but back in 2008 when they did the funding for the Hardin Valley school, they did a balloon note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6855)|
| 1:54:24| So they were basically trying just to take this $25 from each one of the cases to cover the cost of the balloon note for that school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6864)|
| 1:54:35| Well, we were trying to just put it in for school debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| It wasn't earmarked specifically for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| That was what was on our agenda at the time, and we knew that it was going to cost more than we had originally anticipated because we were expanding the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6879)|
| 1:54:47| We had originally thought that the school would go for 1,200 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| It eventually became, what, 1,600 students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| So the school project was expanded, and so as I recall the discussion at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| and the law director said that we could take that extra money to go for school debt, that was what we earmarked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| Okay, and then the $25 for security, that goes directly to the sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| Mr. Caldwell can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| It goes into courthouse security, but as far as the extra dollars, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6911)|
| 1:55:18| It's used to offset the money for the sheriff's officers or the PBA officers that do the security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6918)|
| 1:55:25| either at the City-County Building or the A.J. Building or wherever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6925)|
| 1:55:32| And how much is that on a total, on a yearly basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| The jail security piece in 17, in FY17, we got in $1,086,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6935)|
| 1:55:48| and so the amount in 17 that we sent to school to pay for the school debt was $1,083,000, so basically the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6948)|
| 1:55:58| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6958)|
| 1:56:01| Are you done, Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| Thank you. Yes, sir, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6965)|
| 1:56:07| Mr. Hammond, this $2 million, is that what we have actually collected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6967)|
| 1:56:12| Because you and I have had discussions that you don't collect everything, but that $2 million is actual collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| That's actual collection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6979)|
| 1:56:21| Commissioner Gale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| And can you tell me where the money is allocated for the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| It was allocated for school debt back in 2008, but that was just the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| Where is it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| It's school debt, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6995)|
| 1:56:37| I don't think the ordinance has been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| The ordinance has not been changed since 2008, so it's still going for school debt, 25, well, half of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7000)|
| 1:56:46| and the other half goes for courthouse security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7015)|
| 1:57:00| Item number 78 is discussion on public meeting regarding Beverly Road rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7020)|
| 1:57:15| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| 78.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| We kind of sort of talked about this here at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| but I do have some that wanted to come and speak on this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7048)|
| 1:57:37| Jamie, did you want to speak any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7057)|
| 1:57:46| I saw Mr. Foerster there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| I had it on as a discussion item because I wanted to bring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| and let all of commission know about the community meeting that we had last week over at Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7074)|
| 1:58:05| Very, very well attended meeting considering we just had a few days to kind of get out the word on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7085)|
| 1:58:13| Like I said, we had probably about 100 people that attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| and I have been flooded with e-mails as well as I think all of you all had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7098)|
| 1:58:24| We've got quite a bit of information on this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| and I had I think everybody I asked earlier if you got the copy of this from Mr. Smoot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7109)|
| 1:58:38| on the hydrology and drainage report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7118)|
| 1:58:46| So I think at this time I'll see if Ms. Rowe wants to add and update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| Our community, as well as you all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7131)|
| 1:58:56| is very much against the rezoning that Mr. Gennard has been wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7136)|
| 1:59:08| The zoning that it is, he can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7148)|
| 1:59:16| but the rezoning that he's wanting, he has not purchased the property yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| and so rezoning this property, and once it's rezoned, stays with that property regardless of who purchases it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7161)|
| 1:59:30| We've talked with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| The city has no plans to do anything about Beverly Road with the traffic or widening it or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7172)|
| 1:59:44| and also I have spoke with Norfolk Southern, Jake Ware, and they have big concerns about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7184)|
| 1:59:53| and if they can't be here on Tuesday, they have planned to send a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7193)|
| 1:59:58| because they're very concerned about the flooding issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| and the one thing we want to really point out is that Watts Creek that it runs into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7201)|
| 2:00:08| we have neighbors from the Emberlin Boulevard and Fairmont area and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| because it all flows into Watts Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| and that is what the city has just recently spent in the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7217)|
| 2:00:22| I don't know how much money, on trying to get the flooding and all that taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| So it's not just this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7228)|
| 2:00:32| It doesn't just affect Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| It affects all over Fountain City, even all the way down to where Littons is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7235)|
| 2:00:41| So it's probably one of the biggest deals, I'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| that's been brought up in terms of a rezoning or a development, I'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| in Fountain City that I can remember in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| So Ms. Rowe is very familiar also with it and has been in contact with some of our neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7255)|
| 2:01:04| so I want to give her the opportunity, and if anybody else is here, to speak on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| Commissioners, my name is Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7273)|
| 2:01:18| It's the only development I've ever been involved in, city, county, anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| in 40 years where we've been working on different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| that have come before city council or county commissioner, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| It's the only one I can ever remember that the entire neighborhood is in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7291)|
| 2:01:40| I have not talked to one single person that thinks this rezoning is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7300)|
| 2:01:46| While we were at the meeting, we had 75 people to sign that they were opposed to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7306)|
| 2:01:55| Whites Creek, as Michelle Carringer, our commissioner, was telling you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| Whites Creek flows into First Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| and First Creek goes through Emerland Boulevard and Fairmont,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| and the city has spent several million in a fix on flooding there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| making the channel larger and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| With this development, you would have tremendous flooding with 172 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7335)|
| 2:02:22| as you can tell from Dr. Smoot's report, and that was written 18 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| and nothing has gotten better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| It's only gotten worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| If you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7356)|
| 2:02:37| I'm just trying to remember from last week, did the applicant request a 30-day delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7357)|
| 2:02:49| or a one-month delay, or was it the community that asked for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| It wasn't the community that asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| It was I asked for a delay, for a 30-day delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| because it was put in so quickly that the area and community didn't know anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7383)|
| 2:03:11| And I had asked for Mr. Ganard to bring me plans way back in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7391)|
| 2:03:17| but he never brought any plans to me, and then all of a sudden it was before us on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7397)|
| 2:03:25| So, yes, I asked in terms of being fair to everyone, to Mr. Ganard and to our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7405)|
| 2:03:33| so that he could meet with the community and explain what he was wanting to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7413)|
| 2:03:40| And so we've been very much, ever since last month's meeting, and so, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7420)|
| 2:03:49| But the community didn't request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7431)|
| 2:03:53| I'm remembering that exactly. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| This item says that it's a discussion on the public meeting regarding Beverly Road rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7438)|
| 2:04:04| So these other facts that we're talking about doesn't really have anything to do with this discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| This is just discussing the public meeting, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7449)|
| 2:04:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Well, it was just a report for me to bring back and to talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| and to let them know how the community found out about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| and that the rezoning and all of what Mr. Ganard has wanted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7465)|
| 2:04:32| I just wanted to update everybody on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| and then we get a notice that he's wanting to postpone it for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7475)|
| 2:04:42| And so as of the meeting last week, it was on a go for this following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7482)|
| 2:04:50| So everybody's made plans, and it's out there for us to hear it Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7490)|
| 2:04:58| So, you know, it's kind of put the community and everybody on hold when they planned to be here Tuesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7498)|
| 2:05:10| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| And I guess as far as I know, I mean, we'll have to vote Tuesday whether or not to defer it another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7513)|
| 2:05:21| I mean, I just wanted to let the commission and the community know what our meeting was about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7521)|
| 2:05:29| and that everybody is ñ I've never seen, like Jamie said, I mean, it's overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7529)|
| 2:05:36| I've lived in that area for 56 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| and I've never seen this community come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| I mean, I'm talking about all of District 2 like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| It's really the first time that I've seen it because it doesn't just affect that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7548)|
| 2:05:53| and the people that live on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| It affects everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| So I just want to let everybody know how important this decision is about this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7557)|
| 2:06:03| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| I've got a question that's just procedure-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| I don't think we have any rules on who gets to ask for postponement or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| but was the general rule that the developer can't ask for a 30-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| You know, that was ñ you know, that's procedures we usually do when I was on BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| and I think we've done it here before, so that's just something that we ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7586)|
| 2:06:29| I hate for somebody to come back, come next Tuesday, and we have to come back in June or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| but we need to be up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| Are we going to use common courtesy like we have, or what are we going to do next Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7598)|
| 2:06:43| Typically we have ñ MPC has a rule that you ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7603)|
| 2:06:49| that a developer can ask for an automatic postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| I do not believe we have such a rule, and this item is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7614)|
| 2:07:00| So we can't at this position ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| Did the developer ask for a 30-day extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| He called today and asked for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| Called today and asked, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| But it is still on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| And it's been published, it's been advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7641)|
| 2:07:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| Being as a previous chair of Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7643)|
| 2:07:26| if on the day of work session I had received a call requesting a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7646)|
| 2:07:38| I believe that we normally accepted that request for a postponement with no recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| In other words, they could not come next Monday night, Tuesday in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| and ask for it to be back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| But now I'm only speaking from previous two years' practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7675)|
| 2:07:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| But is that a rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| I mean, does the chairman have that discretion for something that's already on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7682)|
| 2:08:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| Generally you defer as a courtesy to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7688)|
| 2:08:13| The applicant can always withdraw the application too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7693)|
| 2:08:16| I mean, there's a lot of options the applicant has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| And that's one of the reasons that you generally give the courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| So our normal practice is to allow the courtesy to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7704)|
| 2:08:29| but still at the discretion of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| So what you're saying is the applicant could show up next Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| and just ask for it to be withdrawn and then go and reapply the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7715)|
| 2:08:44| Yeah, well, and that's why I want to clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| I feel like when we're saying, you know, if a developer or somebody comes before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7727)|
| 2:08:52| and it's the first time it's being heard and he wants to defer it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7732)|
| 2:08:56| I feel like that that's what I did, you know, that I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| and he was in agreement for it in the April meeting that we defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| So I feel like, you know, he's had his 30 days to defer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7747)|
| 2:09:13| and therefore, I mean, I do have a problem with even making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7753)|
| 2:09:20| or voting to defer it for another 30 days at this month's meeting because of what's been planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7760)|
| 2:09:27| And because the developer from the beginning was the one that didn't get his plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7767)|
| 2:09:33| and didn't get it out to the community, and so I felt like by deferring it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7773)|
| 2:09:39| I gave him that, you know, I gave him the 30 days to defer and get all of it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7779)|
| 2:09:45| So as far as postponing it for another 30 days, I would not be in agreement with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7785)|
| 2:09:53| And if he wants to withdraw and start all over, that's his choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7793)|
| 2:10:01| We'll hear from you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7802)|
| 2:10:10| As far as a withdrawal, that would then again initiate the entire MPC process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7810)|
| 2:10:16| And is there a bar of one year before refiling in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7816)|
| 2:10:20| That's if you fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| That's only—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| But not a withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Not a withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| But it would initiate the MPC process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7827)|
| 2:10:30| Yeah, and as far as getting plans and everything—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| I'm going to clarify one other thing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| His current MPC vote would uphold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7836)|
| 2:10:41| It wouldn't start the whole—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7841)|
| 2:10:42| It would start the appeal over, not the whole process over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7842)|
| 2:10:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| He would just have to pay a filing fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| Correct, if it's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7852)|
| 2:10:54| But again, I think you ultimately end up with the same measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| whereas if we postpone, we're all ready in the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7858)|
| 2:11:04| We would just be back here with a new filing fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| It seems like you're kind of just crossing bridges to cross bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| Again, as far as getting site plans and everything together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7873)|
| 2:11:16| this is a rezoning request and a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| This isn't a use-on-review where my client has an option on a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7879)|
| 2:11:26| I think where a lot of the confusion lays is really what's at issue before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7886)|
| 2:11:31| Now, there are a lot of factors to consider within that, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| But as far as drainage plans, road plans, general sanitary sewer plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7894)|
| 2:11:44| and the elevation plans that all go in that, that's when you're going for use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7904)|
| 2:11:48| And you're looking—that's when you're closer to the approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| and you've got hundreds of thousands of dollars invested at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7912)|
| 2:11:56| So I think that may be where some of the confusion is on people wanting to see actual development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7916)|
| 2:12:03| Just because we are not there, we're asking for the rezoning and the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7923)|
| 2:12:08| for the option and potential ability to submit for that review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| to submit for that consideration and try to come up with something that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| That's what we would be here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| But, again, it's really to allow more time to vet this process out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7940)|
| 2:12:26| I think when it came last April, I didn't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7946)|
| 2:12:31| Last week or the week before, I watched on the video, the archives, to see the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7951)|
| 2:12:38| And as far as the postponement, I called Daniel Sanders today in the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7958)|
| 2:12:44| just to make sure that there wasn't an application, like you said, with NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| where you submit your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7968)|
| 2:12:50| And he instructed me to call Commissioner Smith and follow up with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7970)|
| 2:12:55| But I did send an email to Commissioner Carringer last week stating that we did want to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7975)|
| 2:13:01| to give me more time because I'm kind of new to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7981)|
| 2:13:04| just walk the property at Commissioner Nystrom's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| And after doing that, that's when I did follow up with the request for postponement last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| If I could say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=7998)|
| 2:13:20| We're not under any misconception that they're to have plans or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8000)|
| 2:13:25| What's before you is strictly a rezoning and a vote on a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8005)|
| 2:13:31| And I don't see how another postponement will help any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| no matter if you walk the property or do whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| It's strictly a rezoning and a plan amendment vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8018)|
| 2:13:43| And I don't understand why you would need another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8023)|
| 2:13:51| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| Assistant Law Director Buick, does not BZA have we had rules to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8035)|
| 2:14:04| and the applicant has the right to, in BZA, has the right to postpone for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8044)|
| 2:14:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8051)|
| 2:14:12| It's something that we may need to look at the rules and the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8052)|
| 2:14:16| I don't see, Mr. Forrester, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8056)|
| 2:14:21| You know, I think out of common courtesy that if you come next Tuesday and ask for a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8061)|
| 2:14:28| I don't think that's that ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| I think that's common courtesy that this board, that I will consider, I say I will consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8069)|
| 2:14:35| And that's why I've been reaching out because I didn't want to come Tuesday with everybody showing up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| because I was telling Mr. Buick earlier, I said that's kind of like going to a trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8080)|
| 2:14:45| and the judge swearing the jury and then asking for a continuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| You know, you're kind of stuck with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| It will be your decision next week and the vote will go how the vote goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| Well, let me add, though, we did give them 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8098)|
| 2:15:01| Let's remember we gave them common courtesy to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| And Mr. Forrester was just hired just last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| and we got a notice or he sent me a notice late Friday afternoon that he would like to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8112)|
| 2:15:18| because he's not up to speed on it because he was just hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| So I'm going back to what Ms. Rose said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| We're talking about a rezoning and a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8126)|
| 2:15:33| So, therefore, what do you need 30 more days on that to clarify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8133)|
| 2:15:38| You know, you're either for this or you're not for it right now is the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8138)|
| 2:15:46| And, therefore, I feel like I've given common courtesy that I gave him 30 days from last month to this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8146)|
| 2:15:54| So I just wanted to, you know, I cannot support another 30 days because, like we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8154)|
| 2:16:01| we're talking about a sector plan and a rezoning, and nothing's going to change 30 days from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8161)|
| 2:16:09| What are they going to present that's going to be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| Ms. Rowe, I think you know where my heart is from my background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| and I guess where I'm struggling with this is, like Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| we typically give the applicant a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| In this case, the applicant didn't request the 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8194)|
| 2:16:40| It was requested by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| So my problem is I'm assuming that the – I can't remember the individual's name, the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8204)|
| 2:16:51| but he just went along with that because, you know, why not at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| But he didn't initiate the conversation to defer it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8218)|
| 2:17:03| So I'm kind of probably like Commissioner Daley where thinking that individual does have an unwritten rule that we could delay it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8223)|
| 2:17:15| And I think what Mr. Forrester is trying to do is get – not have 100 people show up in this room next Tuesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8235)|
| 2:17:24| when the potential is it's not going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8244)|
| 2:17:31| And that's where I'm struggling with because they didn't initiate the 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| But I think you need to keep in mind that we didn't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| We just agreed to it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| And we have already chartered a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8265)|
| 2:17:46| We have already sent out flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8266)|
| 2:17:48| We're going to have people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| There's no way we can stop it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| And as I said, it's only a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8274)|
| 2:17:57| There's no plans to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| There's no change of clustering development and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8279)|
| 2:18:03| There's none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| It's just a vote yes or down for rezoning a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8284)|
| 2:18:11| Well, I guess it goes back to what Commissioner Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| I guess the chairman makes the call on this then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| Yes, and I've struggled with the exact same thing you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8298)|
| 2:18:21| It was not the developer that actually asked for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| And we normally do give that courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| And it is fair on his part that he actually contacted Michelle last Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8308)|
| 2:18:34| and let us know, let me know at about 1230 today that his intentions were to not have this heard next Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8314)|
| 2:18:48| So I am regrettably going to say that if he will send the letter stating that he will not have this heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8328)|
| 2:18:57| and don't come in here Tuesday if nobody shows up and try to pull this back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| that I will grant you that courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| Where's the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| Do you have the chair and the commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8353)|
| 2:19:17| Just to clarify, you said earlier you couldn't vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8357)|
| 2:19:21| but now you're saying that you are granting a postponement for sure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| Is that what we're hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| So you are voting on it then to vote, I mean to grant the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS1467180521?start=8369)|
