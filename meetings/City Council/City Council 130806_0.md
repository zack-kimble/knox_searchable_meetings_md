| 0:02:41| Okay, we have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Is there a motion to approve the minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Yes, I have a litany of postponements here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| The first off is 12A, which is dealing with the pet ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| And I would like to defer to the law director here for just a brief moment for discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=188)|
| 0:03:15| Well, we just wanted to explain that this Item 12A, certainly there's always room for debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| there's room for policy issues whenever you're talking about your pet ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| and all the regulations related to the care and maintaining of pets in the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| There's always room for debate about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| But this was really not, when it was brought to you, it was not brought to you as a change in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| It was simply a clarification of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| And it was to clarify that really for decades, at least before 1993, and I think well before 1993,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=223)|
| 0:03:52| the rule within the City of Knoxville, whether you agree with it or don't agree with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| the rule in the City of Knoxville has very consistently been there's a maximum limit of dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=236)|
| 0:04:02| and or cats that you can have in a home, and that limit was four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| It's not something that the city goes out and actively enforces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| It only enforces it on a complaint basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| If there's some problem that comes up and a complaint is made, it's only on that basis that it gets enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| But that's what the rule has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| What happened reasonably recently was that this issue came before the city court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| and the question was raised as to whether it could be read to read that it's a maximum of four per person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| rather than four per home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| And it was, frankly, never intended to read per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| If you had six people in the house, four sixes or 24, 24 dogs could be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=284)|
| 0:04:51| So that issue arose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| And simply to do away with any possible ambiguity related to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=294)|
| 0:04:58| the law department was requested to make a change that made it very clear that the maximum cap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| being the same maximum cap that had been there in that ordinance for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| was a maximum of four per household rather than four per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| And that's what this particular ordinance was crafted to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| There's nothing beyond that, which is not to say that there's not other things that you can talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| but that's what this one was crafted to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| Vice Mayor Palos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Well, Nick, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Are you going to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Do you want to speak to that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| I was going to talk to 10A, but you hadn't gotten to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Okay. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Well, then, thank you, Mr. Rodgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| I do think the emails, the quite a few emails that we got, raised some great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| Outside of just this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| So, with that being said, I want to postpone it until January the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| I'm going to form, I'll do the heavy lifting on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| and I'm going to form a task force that will look into this, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| the broader picture of the pet issue throughout Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| So, January 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| So, that's a motion to postpone 12A, dealing with the pet ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Until January 21st of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| I guess I will add something, and that is that we all have gotten a lot of emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| and it goes beyond the point that our law director made pretty clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| that they're really trying to say, is it the number of people in the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| or what's a dwelling unit, and that's where the limit applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| And I think that's kind of a pretty easy clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| that maybe we can even make sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| But the policy questions that have been raised are significant in terms of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| if you have limits that are artificial or artificially strict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| do you make people feel like they're not law abiders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| or that they can disregard the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| and that's not a healthy thing in terms of civic pride and civic duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=421)|
| 0:07:06| And also the questions of whether we should be looking at what other cities do on spaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| and neutering and trying to avoid the problem of too many pets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| and certainly having to put pets to sleep at Young Williams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=435)|
| 0:07:19| because they can't find enough homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| And those are all legitimate questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| and I commend you for assembling the task force to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| It's certainly worth a policy look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| and it's certainly worth hearing from all the constituents on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And thanks for those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| And once we get into the work on it, if we want to break, you know, the two issues apart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| then we always have that ability to bring that back to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| and so perhaps that will come from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| I don't think anyone is writing about we want to fight over what's a household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| I don't think that was ever the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| So, anyway, that's my motion, and it has a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| As we create this task force, I would really like to encourage us to set a sunset date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=479)|
| 0:08:07| for this to come back to council rather than go on for a very long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| because once you investigate one aspect, then two more pop up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| So I really think that the scope of the investigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| and a time frame needs to be established when you create the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| You know, the time frame as it stands would be January the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| That's when I'm postponing it to, and I have every intention of meeting that deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| I just want to add to this that, you know, previous council gave us this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| If you all want to, you know, take that task force on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| and bring back other changes to vote on, we are perfectly fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| I know you'll work closely with the enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I will work closely with the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| in addition to all of the various interest groups in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Did you want to speak to that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| You asked anyone having postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Keep it on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| So we have a motion and a second to postpone 12A until January 21st, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=560)|
| 0:09:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| I'd like to make a motion to postpone 12G, H, and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| which is the, for better or lack of terminology here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| the Dean Hill-Rufus Smith issue until September the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| So that's, okay, so September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=591)|
| 0:09:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| This is to postpone 12G, H, and I until September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| I would also like to make the motion to postpone 12V,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| which is dealing with the rezoning for the potential Tenova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| I guess for lack of better terminology again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| issue off of Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| There will be a workshop either the 22nd or the 29th of this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| and we'll confirm that tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| And I think, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| Was that V as in Victor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| V as in Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| V as in Victor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| I think Mr. King, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=638)|
| 0:10:52| John King, Post Office Box 2425 in the office of Tennessee 37901,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=652)|
| 0:11:00| Mayor and Members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| You haven't said exactly when you proposed to postpone it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| And speaking to that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| I would observe that my client has been very communicative with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=679)|
| 0:11:29| people and those entities who have asserted interest in the subject matter of this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=689)|
| 0:11:37| We have met with neighborhood groups multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| We have been open to those meetings and phone calls and trying to respond to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=702)|
| 0:11:49| And we had hoped to go forward with a two-week postponement because of the absence of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| Councilman Grieve and his interest in postponing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| What I would observe is that, as most of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| when you're trying to develop a project, time is money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| And we're in a situation where we have to deal with the property acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| We have to deal with the contractors and the architects and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| all of whom have to work on a timeline looking to when this project is ready to start work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=745)|
| 0:12:34| Once you make a change in that timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| then that starts backing them up and into problems and issues about their own particular schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=757)|
| 0:12:45| So I had hoped and my client had hoped we could go forward and just postpone it two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| and have this up for consideration at your next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| I do not feel comfortable in insisting on doing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| and saying under no circumstances would we agree to a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| I like to respect the wishes of council as much as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| but I'm pointing out to you that it is working a hardship on my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| a hardship being cast in the category of expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| as well as, as I say, an established timeline for trying to get things accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=806)|
| 0:13:34| I appreciate the interest of the persons who suggest a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| I would say that if we didn't have a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| we would be open to any meetings suggested by any particular member of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| We can't meet with you at once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| and maybe you all don't even want to meet with us on an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| without notifying the press, the media, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=838)|
| 0:14:02| But we would certainly be willing to meet with as many as wanted to meet with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| in the interim period of time between now and two weeks from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| Like I say, I'm offering other potential alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| and I guess I'm whining a little bit on behalf of my client about the delay to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=856)|
| 0:14:24| more than a month from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| and then we've still got to go to that second reading thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=868)|
| 0:14:36| As I say, I've made my statement as far as the interest of my client and my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=876)|
| 0:14:46| I'm not going to curl up and die if this postponement is granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| but my preference is certainly otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| We certainly wouldn't want you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Do we have a second on that to postpone 12V, the Tenova rezoning, Middlebrook Pike, to September 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=904)|
| 0:15:14| Are you speaking to that or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| I was just going to ask one question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| In light of that request, is there any earlier date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| I know the workshop has to come before you to get the facts in order to sit down and make a decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| so it has to be more than two weeks because the workshop's headed towards the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=928)|
| 0:15:33| Is there any other date, or is that pretty much the closing date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| I mean, I think council has decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| You know, we've pretty well polled twice, and I think the 17th is the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| And I hate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| I mean, I spoke with Mr. King and the folks from Tenova, and just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| I guess the comeback would be that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| an uninformed council could make a decision that wouldn't please them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Dumb decisions don't help anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| They would certainly work to the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| If I understood, your suggestion was for the workshop to be either on the 22nd or the 29th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| And that will be determined tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| The motion is postponed to September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| I would like to make a motion to postpone 12WX and Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| That is the Bridgewater rezoning issue to August the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=994)|
| 0:16:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| 12WX and Y postponed to August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Is there any discussion of a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1006)|
| 0:16:50| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| And that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| And lastly, I would make a motion to postpone until September the 3rd items number 12AA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1016)|
| 0:17:08| AB, and AC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| And that deals with the North Shore proposed development for the apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1031)|
| 0:17:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| So we have a motion and a second to postpone 12AA, 12AB, and 12AC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| dealing with the North Shore Town Center, to September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| And that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| I would like to make a motion to postpone 11U, the Chilhowee Park bandstand renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1063)|
| 0:17:49| for two weeks to August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| We have a motion and a second to postpone 11U,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| dealing with the Chilhowee Park bandstand renovations, for two weeks to August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| And that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| I wanted to have a motion to postpone Item 10A, if our colleagues will remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| We postponed it last time so that the parties could get a more detailed site plan for the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| as opposed to the one unit of a duplex that was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| And that has just been completed either last night or today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| And so they're asking for a two-week postponement until, I guess that would be August the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| in order for the developer and his engineer to sit down with the neighborhood group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| and actually carry out what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| There was a debate about whether we take two weeks or four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| and it looks like we've morphed into the four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| But the good news is they're going to work together to sit down and analyze that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| So I move that we postpone until the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Okay, we have a motion and a second to postpone Item 10A, the appeal, to August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| The ayes have it, and that is postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Any others for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| I believe that's a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| I think it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Items to be added by motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Consent items, we have 11A and B, certificates of compliance, and 12Z to 12AT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1169)|
| 0:19:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| The ayes have it, and those are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| For the mayor's report, yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| Councilman Della Vopi emceed us at the opening of the Love's Creek Greenway at Spring Place Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| This greenway will ultimately run from Spring Place Park to New Harvest Park, long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| But for now, we have a half a mile, about a half a mile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| It's about a half a mile right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| About a half a mile, made of crushed limestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| And there were a lot of partners, the county, Parks and Rec, the Sheriff's Inmate Work Release Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| of course, our public service crew, several of them were on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| Neighborhood volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Neighborhood volunteers, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| And Councilman Della Vopi, who supported us prior to even becoming a councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| So we appreciate him and, of course, Joe Walsh and Lori Gerlich with our Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| All of these and more were part of making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| So get out there and enjoy Love's Creek Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Tomorrow, our former mayor, Governor Haslam, will be coming back home for an announcement on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| This is at 12 noon tomorrow, August 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| He will be announcing or launching his new Healthier Tennessee initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| and announcing the formation of the Governor's Foundation for Health and Wellness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| And apparently health and wellness is becoming a top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| And I think that really fits in well with the opening of our Greenway and our Let's Move initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| and our outdoor Knoxville and urban wilderness, all those things that are going on right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| all are about making a healthier Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| And the governor is doing the same statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1281)|
| 0:21:23| So if you want to join with the governor, it's tomorrow, August 7th at 12 noon on Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| Also, we'll be having another ribbon-cutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| I love these ribbon-cuttings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| A lot of good things going on are opening up and projects being completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| Next Wednesday, August 14th at 11 a.m., we will be at the West Hills Pavilion at West Hills Tennis Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1297)|
| 0:21:46| The pavilion will provide shade and allow spectators to watch the tennis games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| Last year we opened the clubhouse, so this is a really great addition to West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| So that's next Wednesday, August 14th at 11 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| And finally, next Tuesday, August 13th at 5.30 p.m., I'm holding one of our Neighborhood Connections events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| which is bringing several neighborhoods together in a region of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| And this will be south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| It is at the Woodlawn Christian Church on Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| And we're inviting all south Knoxville neighbors and neighborhood organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| folks who are interested to come and meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Apartment heads will be there, and we'll let you know what we're doing south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| and also be there to answer questions and receive requests and concerns from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| So encourage a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| That's Tuesday, August 13th at 5.30 p.m. at Woodlawn Christian Church on Woodlawn Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1358)|
| 0:22:45| That's the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| Council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| I just wanted to footnote your comments about the trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| I am so proud of our guys in the public service team that rolled up their sleeves and did that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1374)|
| 0:23:02| And it showed that, you know, there is a great use of in-house manpower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| These guys have very full schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| but occasionally there are windows where they're in brush pickup or repaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| And if I understood Joe Walsh correctly, we spent more like $38,000 than $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| if we had contracted this out to someone who would bid on all the materials and the length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| And I think it's just a wonderful use of our crews, and I want to thank them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| and those guys, their spirit that they put into getting it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| Thank them for risking some poison ivy, they told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Some poison ivy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| They told me that was one of the biggest risks was the poison ivy out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| I just wanted to make note of the passing of Sharon Smith Mosby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| who was a great singer here in the city of Knoxville and a Knoxville native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| And I express my condolences on behalf of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| Certainly she was an outstanding singer and brought joy to many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| So I just wanted to make note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| It's a wonderful concert whenever you get to hear Sharon Mosby sing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Any other reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| Okay, moving on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| 8A is a resolution confirming the appointment of Lieutenant Edgar Earl Mitchell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| and Marva Martin to the Civil Service Merit Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| 9A is an ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2013-2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Yes, I'd like to make a motion to amend 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| And I will go to Mr. Law Director here for the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| First, we need a motion to approve and then we do the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Motion to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Now we need the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| And then I'll make the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| And the motion to amend will be consistent with the revised version of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| that was distributed to you with your regular packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| And the changes that are made are really changes to the amount that's being changed in the budget for general fund transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1515)|
| 0:25:25| It goes from $1,360,000 to $1,550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Also, the same with regard to the capital projects fund is increased by the amount to take it from $1,360,000 to $1,550,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1531)|
| 0:25:44| to be used for the Jackson Avenue acquisition project that you are all familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| So that would be the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| And then if that amendment is adopted, then there may be a second amendment coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Because he had made the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| So the motion is to amend as he just described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| I just want to let everyone know I'll be abstaining for the same reasons I outlined last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| that my firm's involved in the underlying litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Councilman Del Voco, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| Yeah, I was just wondering if Jim York or perhaps Mr. Swanson can explain just the broad brush general reason for the shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| just so that we understand how we got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| I would think perhaps Mr. Wetzel might be best qualified to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| The 1.5 that you have before you tonight is what the actual cost to acquire the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| and to do the stabilization, that's estimated stabilization work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| We already had a little money in our Jackson Avenue fund that would stay in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| It would help us with any potential future other acquisitions along the corridor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| It would help us deal with legal bills that are coming out of this litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| There's quite a bit of that we still have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| So this funding would allow us to have a little breathing room to buy the property, get the property stabilized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| make sure we got our legal bills covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| and give us a little negotiation room with another property down there on the corridor that we may need to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| to put a good package together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1641)|
| 0:27:22| And is that true for the other figure that Mr. Swanson mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| that went from 1,026 to 1.5, or is that the same number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| That's the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| We went to 1.3 last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| We had 1.9 in our Jackson account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| And so this is just 1.5 plus the 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| We're going to save that 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| We're going to save that 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| It's contingencies that will come up that's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Any other councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| I mean a vice mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| So this is a motion to amend to those new figures as just cited and discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1672)|

| 0:28:04| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Oh, I'm sorry, one extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| And with that passage, then, I would like to also move that we hear this on an emergency basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| because, obviously, this is a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| It would have to go back to first reading if not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| So this would be the final reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| So I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1705)|
| 0:28:26| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1707)|

| 0:28:31| The ayes have it with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Now we're back to the original motion as amended two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| So we're voting on the ordinance with the change in amounts and with the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1723)|
| 0:28:55| We already had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1735)|

| 0:29:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| And that has passed 9A as amended with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 15, Article 2, Sections 1551, 1557,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| relating to the nondiscrimination policy for hiring city of Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1762)|

| 0:29:25| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Nourish Knoxville, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1767)|
| 0:29:33| to create a food guide to connect growers, food producers, and food artisans with our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| in an amount not to exceed $40,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| I wanted to ask the gentleman, Mr. Schmidt, to come up and just tell us this briefly sets up a program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1786)|
| 0:29:56| where you're going to gather the data, build the database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| and help both individuals and businesses know where the food is coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| and that it's locally grown as opposed to something coming from overseas or somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Planning is going to be identified connecting local producers in the Levin County region to consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| And so this is putting together a majority of this money would go putting together a food guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| This is one from Asheville area, if you've all ever been over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| that lists farms, grocery stores that use local produce, restaurants that use local produce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| and farmers markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| And that way this is going to set up a mock one that we can then go out and show farmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| and all these other organizations what it is and get them onto this food guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| And it will be more than brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| We plan to do this year on out for as long as we're around as an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| And this particular approval puts $40,200 in the pot to accomplish that initial assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And I asked you earlier is what commitment does that make in terms of the city to nourish Knoxville in terms of any future costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1854)|
| 0:31:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| The majority of the costs are for the setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| It won't take this amount of money every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1867)|
| 0:31:09| We will have ads and stuff that will sustain this food guide going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| If there's any grant money out there, we'd be, you know, happy to look at that also as a source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| But we're not, as you put it, it's not another mouth to feed for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| So it will be self-sustaining through ad revenue and any grant money we get from any organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| But the goal ultimately is to keep this up to date so that the information you get is still valid a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| We'll have to have someone to update the online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| It will be online and also to connect with the farmers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| You know, farms come online and others that may not want their information in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| So it does require some ongoing costs, but we figure that will be covered from revenue and other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| This is just a setup to give us the prototype.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| I appreciate the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| I just thought some people might not know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| And Community Development Director Becky Wade, do you want to add something to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| I just wanted to add that this is a one-time contract for the food guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1919)|
| 0:32:05| This is with Plan E.T. Sustainable Communities funds that will run out the end of January 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1925)|
| 0:32:14| So this is a one-time contract for a deliverable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| And also, just to clarify, this is brought to City Council to approve because we are the recipient of the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| but it's actually a region-wide effort, region-wide leadership that has brought this recommendation to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| It's not just our administration that we're glad to support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| but it's a region-wide initiative that is supported by all of the partners in the Plan E.T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| Part of that $4 million, three-year grant that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| If anybody wants to take a look, I can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=1967)|

| 0:41:32| and provide resources for the agencies to reach out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| Thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| Yes, Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| I want to also speak to that because, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| it's an issue that's plaguing a good portion of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| And we did have a panel just a few weeks ago trying to deal with that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2510)|
| 0:42:00| So I'm glad to see this occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| and hope that we'll be able to solve some of the gun violence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| and gang violence that's going on in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2532)|
| 0:42:14| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to agreement C-13-158| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| with Cannon & Cannon, Inc. for additional professional engineering services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| associated with the Setre Landing Park project in an amount not to exceed $14,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Since we've got Bob Wetzel here, I've just got to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| why do we have Lincoln Landing on the shore of the Tennessee River?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| Can't we get Admiral Farragut or something landing over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| where we get a Tennessee boy and an Knoxville boy recognized for his service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| All things are possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| We're working with the name that was given us when we started with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| You all have a street naming committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| There's more to that issue, but that's enough for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| That's a relatively small amount, I guess, based on what I was reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| I just was wondering what exactly, what did we miss, something with the $14,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| and really why wasn't that noticed on the front end on a pretty big contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| I'll try to give you a short answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| and if we need to get more detailed, Don LaShelle is here to talk some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Basically, when we went into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| there was one boathouse that had been designed in the previous structure back in 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| that had the footings and the pylons out into the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| That looked like it was going to, as we did our constructability review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| that was moving towards a million-dollar boathouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| We got some ideas from our architects on how we might take that million-dollar boathouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| back to a $500,000 boathouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| and so we decided it was worth spending the $14,000 to make that change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| to get them to work in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Do you think that's going to be a boathouse that the city is going to build, or how do you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| Well, it's called Lincoln Landing, and it's several features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Don, you might want to come up and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| There will be a picnic pavilion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| There will be a place to store kayaks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| There will be a place to put boats into the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| There will be a small restroom facility, things along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| You did it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Don's worked hard on this all day, Everett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| I think questions were answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Thank you for your work, Don, Michelle, and Bob on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2679)|

| 0:45:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| We'll let Don, Michelle, come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| You kind of stole her thunder last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| We'll put her on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Well, we've seen some drawings already, schematic drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| explaining how this is going to be different and how they're going to mesh together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| Good evening, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Don, Michelle Foster, Deputy Director of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| As you know, back in 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| MPC did a Magnolia Avenue corridor plan study, which was approved by Council also in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2747)|
| 0:45:54| What we're requesting is for a contract to move into schematic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| and conceptual design for those plans on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| We know Magnolia Avenue is a great corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| We know it's a great street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| We just want to make it a great, complete street by adding some pedestrian amenities to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| intersection improvements, streetscape improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| and also bring some vitality and enhancement that can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| in economic development along the corridor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| Supporting the Mayor's initiative, moving from disinvestment to investment from the downtown out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| Magnolia is a great east-west connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| It's also a state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| And so we'll serve that purpose to enhance that corridor greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Yes, I wanted to ask you over in that there's a task force that will be assembled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| That's part of the scope of services that our consultant has actually in their contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| and we will have public meetings as well as a stakeholder group as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| Well, I was reading the information about the neighborhood group that will be represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| and it's about at least three neighborhood groups that border Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| So I hope that all three of those neighborhood groups, Park Ridge, Cold Springs, Hill Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2831)|
| 0:47:19| they'll all be invited and be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| That's correct, and we'll make sure that you can help us get those neighborhood groups on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2848)|

| 0:47:32| Yes, Don Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| I hope that you'll let us know when those public meetings are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| and also the East Knox Business and Professional Organization has taken a real interest in life along Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| and the business development, and I think it would be great to involve all those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| when we have these consultants in town on those two scheduled public meetings to get their input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| and to get their sort of buy-in to what we're doing because this is a great step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| We know that Magnolia Avenue serves a purpose for most of those business owners along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| Bob and I both attend those meetings monthly, and we also have them listed as a stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2888)|

| 0:48:10| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| I have one other comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| I hope that in that particular area that we will get some minority businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| that are subcontracted for that work in that area, and I just wanted to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2897)|
| 0:48:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2905)|

| 0:48:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2910)|

| 0:48:33| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| 11Y is a resolution authorizing the mayor to accept a proposal from Travelers Indemnity Company of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| for property, flood, earthquake, and boiler and machinery insurance coverage for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| for a total annual premium of $180,247 and to execute a contract consistent with the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2924)|
| 0:48:52| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| I don't know if Gary is here or Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Someone is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Gary is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| I hate to make you walk all the way up here, but Gary, the way I read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2940)|
| 0:49:04| we found a way to save money by piggybacking with the county in terms of this type of insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| and if you would just take a second and tell us about that because this is obviously another example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| of managing the business so that we spend less dollars to get what we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2956)|

| 0:49:33| on their property insurance policy because with all the schools and buildings they have covered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| they have a property schedule that's about three times our size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| and they're able to get a rate much lower than we could get on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| Get a volume discount, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=2988)|

| 0:55:21| to Neighborhood Commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Because we sent this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Corner track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| Is this the corner track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3328)|
| 0:55:29| Not the inner one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| We left the other one opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Because we split those two tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3333)|
| 0:55:34| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3334)|

| 0:56:38| Councilman Stanton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| I can guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| I just had a question for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| I noticed that this was next to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| Is there any reason why the staff felt C-4 was better than planned commercial or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| would be the advantages and disadvantages of each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| The staff has a long tradition of recommending planned commercial in these instances, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| there is a long history of those recommendations not being carried forward by either the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| Commission or the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| So we've kind of given up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3437)|
| 0:57:18| Well, there's an honest answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| Yeah, but I want to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| This was for automotive sales and repair, so I assume that it has some external use of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3445)|
| 0:57:32| but in terms of putting cars and that type of stuff on the lot as opposed to inside a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| Is that why you have C-4 as the staff recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| The dominant zoning in that area is a combination of C-3 and C-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| and the big difference between the two districts is the outdoor storage treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| In C-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| C-4 is broader with respect to the uses that can be done on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| But I take it in the midst of all that explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| automotive and automotive repair tends to be more on the C-4 side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| Is that fair or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3491)|
| 0:58:12| That's an appropriate zone for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| It's not just compatibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| It's appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Almost mandatory, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| Almost mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3498)|

| 0:59:59| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| Since Mark is here, I wanted to just ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| It almost looked as I was reading through this, a little bleary-eyed with the 1,100 pages we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3602)|
| 1:00:07| that the reason for the zoning change is to allow them to have some type of new signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3607)|
| 1:00:15| Am I reading that right, or is that just incidental to the whole process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3615)|
| 1:00:22| It would be speculation on my part, but, yeah, that may be the driving factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| There are significant differences between the regulations related to signs between R2 and any of the commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3627)|
| 1:00:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| And this is in a location, obviously, on Merchant Drive where there is a lot of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3644)|

| 1:01:09| And per NBC, this was the best way to go about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| The best solution was to add that commercial label so that you could have the sign in the locations you needed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| Yes, on the side of our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| And this is not a separate proposal coming on that's aside from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Are you really focusing on this question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| It's our existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| That's the only reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Very big, nice church along Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Tell us more about that sign and where you're going to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| I mean, you've built out the side where it looks to be pretty dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| So, anyway, tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| We would like to put the name on the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| And to do that, we had to go from R2, which was the original designation of the property when we acquired it 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3715)|
| 1:02:07| I don't know how we got our first sign, but it was destroyed and we've lived without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| And time to put our name on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| And this is a process we're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| And that's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| So, no pole sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| At some point, we might like to put a monument sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| But right now, we just want to put our name on the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Even you sign guys ought to like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3756)|

| 1:02:40| So, is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3761)|

| 1:03:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3791)|
| 1:03:14| Do you have your line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| I'll just leave it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3795)|
| 1:03:16| I'll say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3797)|
| 1:03:18| I mean, this is, I mean, they've got, they're right up against Merchant's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| And this is, I mean, this is the very issue that we're trying to deal with in the sign ordinance that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| we've been working on for 18 months is to limit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| I mean, they're not adding on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| This is strictly for more signage on Merchant's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| You've been out there, and they're pretty visible with their large steeple, and it's way high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3814)|
| 1:03:41| I mean, to me, it just seems excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| And for them to be able to put another pole sign up there in the future or something, it's just, to me, it's excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| Wouldn't you have to permit that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Wouldn't you have to seek a permit for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| You'd have the zoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| You'd have the zoning that would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| You'd have the zoning that would allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| So, if you've been out there, I mean, if you know it's a church, the question is, what's the name of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| It's plenty visible, I think, but that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| Well, I mean, I'm certainly taking them on their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| I know that's a little dangerous sometimes in this situation, but, I mean, if I'm not correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| you want to have your name on the building and possibly a monument sign in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| but you're not proposing any kind of pole sign, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| That is very correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| We don't even have a design for a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| We just understood this was the first step to even allow us to put our name on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=3877)|

| 1:07:41| Is Rocky Swingle still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| Please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| Mr. Swingle, please state your name and address, and by council rules, I'll set the timer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| and you have up to five minutes, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Rocky Swingle, 7213 Sheffield Drive in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| I want to comment on the SANOVA issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| First, thank you, council, for scheduling the workshop for the 22nd or 29th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| whichever one it happens to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| We really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| It's a serious issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| It deserves a full discussion and, you know, airing out everything, and we appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| And secondly, thank you again for postponing the first reading of the rezoning ordinance until September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4104)|
| 1:08:32| You know, we may or we probably won't know the situation with SANOVA by then, the ownership, the direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| the strategic plan, the business plan, but maybe we'll know a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| And I think it's dangerous to rezone without the dust settling a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4124)|
| 1:08:52| You know, you kind of open the door for unintended consequences if you rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| and then all of a sudden SANOVA takes a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| So thank you for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| I also want to mention, in case you didn't know, you probably do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| but last night there was a meeting of the Wesley Neighbors Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| which represents houses on the eastern side of West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| And one of the, well, really the item on the agenda was a vote on whether people wanted the hospital to be built on Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4157)|
| 1:09:25| or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| The vote was no, 91, yes, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| We also have throughout West Hills now a couple of hundred yard signs with more actually arrived today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| We ran out of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Our petition has 300-plus names on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| And if you recall, I'll mention again the July 8th meeting when about 100 residents showed up at the West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| where SANOVA was presenting and pretty much told them we didn't want their hospital there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| So if there's any doubt in your mind about how the community feels, these facts should clear things up, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4199)|
| 1:10:11| The other issue is, you know, this is potentially a huge project for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| You know, you're talking about a $300 million investment by SANOVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| And there are taxes associated with that and there are temporary jobs associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| I don't think there are permanent jobs because I think the people in North Knoxville are just going to move west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| or they're not going to work in West Knoxville and somebody else who works in Knoxville will fill those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4235)|
| 1:10:40| So I don't think you're going to see a net gain in permanent jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| But there will be taxes, you know, and some temporary jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| But the point I want to make is those taxes and those temporary jobs are not free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4247)|
| 1:10:54| We, the residents, pay the price for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| The biggest price, arguably, is the closing of St. Mary's as a full-service hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| If SANOVA bills, that hospital goes away as a full-service hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| That's the price to North Knoxville and surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| That's the biggest price, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| The other big price, which you've heard about, is the diminution of quality of life for people in West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| particularly West Hills, Ridge Rock Road, which technically is West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| even the houses across Middlebrook Pike, the condos and the apartments adjacent to the Dowell Springs business area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4293)|
| 1:11:43| The biggest complaint is traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| The second biggest is the intrusive nature of this big development on a community that doesn't have anything like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4306)|
| 1:11:56| and doesn't want anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| And the third biggest, and by biggest I mean what you hear mostly from residents, the third biggest is an environmental issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| particularly flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| There's a creek that runs across the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4327)|
| 1:12:09| It originates in West Hills in the northeastern part of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| And over the years, they've had flooding problems and still do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| and people there are very fearful that this is going to increase those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4339)|
| 1:12:25| Also, people are concerned with loss of open space, with wildlife, because this whole area is surrounded by development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| and there's no place for them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| Sir, you have 45 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| We were told last night that the city was not going to do a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| and I urge you to change that and do a thorough traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| So NOVA's going to do a study of the main arteries as required by law, we were told, Middlebrook and Weisgarber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4365)|
| 1:12:52| We need to look at West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| We need to look where West Hills roads enter into Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| We need to look at Old Weisgarber, the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| And I really think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| This is a huge issue, and I really think it's important for council to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| if it's your job or somebody's to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| And the other one is an environmental study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Council should fund that as well, particularly looking at the flooding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| And finally, I know I'm running out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| I invite you again to come walk the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| If you had some interest in that, you'll be amazed to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| We'll be happy to, you know, show you around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| I would ask Mark Donaldson to clarify about the traffic study, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| It's not that the city won't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Explain how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| The proposed zoning is 01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| and a hospital is listed in the 01 zone district as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| As part of the submittal for a use on review for a hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| the applicant will be required to submit a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4438)|
| 1:14:04| and we have determined that it will probably be the most intense traffic study that we outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4444)|
| 1:14:11| in our administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| As part of that application, it will be reviewed by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| and reviewed by the Planning Commission and become a part of the public packet of material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4457)|
| 1:14:24| So we do require a study, and a study will be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| and as intensive a study as MPC requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| and we've actually stated that we want an intensive study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| So that does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| It's just that the burden is on Tenova to do it, but it's to our standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| My request is to do it before you vote on the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| because that's probably the most important factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| or certainly in the top two or three that you should consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| you, council, should consider before you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| That was my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| I'd like to say that Mr. King, after we postponed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| came out and told me that his client would have to be there on the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| So the workshop will be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Oh, that's the convenient date for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Well, we need them there, so obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| Yeah, we have to have them there, so the council knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I just wanted to tell Mr. Rocky Swindle that it would be prudent for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| or someone from your group to be at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| I'm sure they'll be there, won't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Don't assume that because you've said it here that our memories will carry forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| or that one of our colleagues who isn't here today had the family weddings to go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| but it's important that you make that record so that all the facts can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| So are you saying it's set for the 29th, or are we still waiting to hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| Well, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| Without a testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| Yeah, without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| I mean, that's the whole purpose is for us to see, you know, their plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| and hear from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| So, I mean, I don't want to have two workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| I mean, obviously I want to tell people that it's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| so I want to tell them the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Is that official?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| I mean, we voted on it earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| It was the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| I know we discussed it at our pre-meeting dinner this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| But if Mr. King says that's when his client can be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| then I think that that's the date that it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| You know, we can discuss that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| But if that's when his client can be here, I don't know what else to do but that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| Why don't you leave an email address or a contact with Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| She'll let you know if there's any change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Is there anything else, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4601)|
| 1:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4628)|
| 1:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4658)|
| 1:18:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4688)|
| 1:18:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4718)|
| 1:19:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil130806?start=4748)|
