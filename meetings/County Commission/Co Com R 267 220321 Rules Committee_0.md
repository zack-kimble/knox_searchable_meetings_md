| 0:08:12| My only concern just over all, about the seven days, and I pray this never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| If we were to have a vacancy that was totally unexpected, sudden death or something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=498)|
| 0:08:32| this, I think most all of them that we have, everybody knows it's coming and you just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| People have made intentions clear and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| But if we were to suddenly wake up one morning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| an elected official had unfortunately passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| would we still feel like seven days was enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| Just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Or in some cases, what do we say, it might be too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| Let's say, for instance, a county mayor passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| And would you want to wait seven days to install a new mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Well, there's a transition automatically for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Or a criminal court clerk in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| But I mean, it would be just, in other words, once you identified that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| vacancy was open, whatever time frame that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| then you would just have up to seven days before we vote to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| that you've let everybody know that you want to be a candidate for that, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| So it says at least, you could set it for longer, according to how this is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| You could say this is so important, we really need more on 15 days, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| But at the end of the day, every time we have a rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| we can end up at the same place and just, we could suspend the rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=585)|

| 0:10:14| Who's next on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Is it me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| As you see down here in red here, any commissioner who attends an outside conference shall submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=618)|
| 0:10:44| to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| This one is a discussion and consideration regarding protocols for handling late resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=645)|
| 0:10:59| brought before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| I brought this up because we have some things that appear before us real quickly, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| brought to us, and we take a look at it and said, oh, this came to us, and it hadn't gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| from me to the legal department where it says it is to the proper form, and if there's other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=673)|
| 0:11:22| things that are attached to it that we need to know about, because it was said that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| school board brought, and the last thing we had was the school board had people there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| to have something done about the masking problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| But it was brought to us so quickly, and we were going to vote on some funding for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| to law, and I think that was a little bit quick to come to us without going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| our law department, and that's why we have a law department to look to make sure what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| comes to us is in legal form and to handle it properly, and we've talked about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=712)|
| 0:12:02| how things come to us real quickly, now the chairman can put it on there, but we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| to have the discussions and stuff like this to see if it's an emergency to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| and I don't think that was an emergency type situation, and I just thought we ought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| do something about the protocol, because what some presented to you, just like you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| the candidate, how would you like to be walked in and said, oh, we're going to do a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| thing, and we're going to do it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| In that circumstances, I can kind of remember when it was presented to us, did we vote to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| move it forward with our recommendation of the following week, or did we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| Or did we vote to add it to the agenda and move it forward at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| I don't remember, I just noticed it came up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| She asked me if I remembered, and I said no, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| That was not a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Well, I'm just saying, if we voted to send it forward without recommendation, we all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| could have said, hey, look, we're not moving this forward at all, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| We could have stopped it right then, and said we're not even going to consider something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| that comes into us five minutes before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| So we ought to have some sort of guidelines to tell us, okay, if it's a dire emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=801)|
| 0:13:25| where we have to approve some sort of emergency funding or something like this, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| should do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| But we've been accepting things at the last minute that we've never, when I first got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| on here, it was never on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| In fact, the whole commission would discuss it and decide whether they're going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| it on there, or it had to wait until the next month to be put on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=821)|
| 0:13:45| And I don't know, I'm one of these things that you ought to have some sort of guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| to tell us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Do we not have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| We had something in the rules to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Is your concern primarily due to form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| Due to form and legality of what was brought before us at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| Because it was brought before us that the school board had recommended it to us, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| they really didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Well, since we can't vote on it at that meeting, I mean, there is, then if we vote to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=849)|
| 0:14:22| forward without recommendation, or even with recommendation, still it's not the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| The vote on it itself, and that seven day period before the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| But what if it wasn't at the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| What if it was at the next meeting to be added to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| Well, I think we would just have to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| Is there a requirement that a resolution has to be written or reviewed by the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| in order to be a proper resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| No, anybody can bring one, commissioner or somebody down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| We've discussed this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=898)|
| 0:15:00| It's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| But we have a law department that says all legal actions go through the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| That was a legal action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| That's part of your job, Mr. Hatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| All the law department does, we don't get into the good or bad or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=913)|
| 0:15:20| it's a policy decision of the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| All we do is look and read that thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Does it meet legal requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| And that says approved as to form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| Basically as to form, but not content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| Only as to form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| And that's all we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Whether we agree with it or disagree with it, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| That's your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| That's the commission's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| All we do is look at the form of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| But again, the way it was brought forth, it wasn't brought forth by a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| person that they said they were representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| But that doesn't, I mean, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| You're talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| But if we had voted on that thing and said, yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| Then that would have really been our bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Yes, our bad, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| I don't think we need to be putting that place to where we say we're bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=968)|
| 0:16:11| Well, then that's our bad decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| I mean, somebody can actually bring a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=974)|
| 0:16:23| in the middle of a commission meeting right before the agenda is set and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I have a brand new one that no one's seen on commission night, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| And say, I've got something I wrote over the weekend and I want to put it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=990)|
| 0:16:35| And then the body would vote to either add it to the agenda and consider it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| Well, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| But a commissioner, usually if somebody like in the public wants something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| they go to their commissioner and say, would you bring this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| And the commissioner brings it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Commissioning bringing up something is one thing in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| It doesn't change the legality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| It's just no problem with the commissioner when it comes from somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| Then it shouldn't even matter because if the chairman's going to put it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| he's got that right to do so anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| So it's got the right to rest of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| It goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1033)|
| 0:17:13| It's just kind of catches everybody cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Like the last one you're talking about came from the mayor's office five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| before they dropped the hammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| I asked Rich yesterday, what about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| He said, that's the first time I've seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| But we all approved it to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| So we have the right not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| But we've been doing it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| We haven't been doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| And we all of a sudden, like you said, that's just to spin the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| So why would we even have rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| We had that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| Those rules are meant to be broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| Gives us a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Well, it should give us a guideline of something we should act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| But it's mainly you're all as part of the commission to decide what you want to do on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1078)|
| 0:18:06| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| But if you don't have a rule, if you've got rules, rules are rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1087)|
| 0:18:14| Do you suspend them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| And I'm not sure that you know, but you have to have a certain vote to suspend approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| But it's just a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| There's been nothing against the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| It's happened though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Yeah, I mean everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| But like I said, to me, if we want to have an orderly process of how we do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1109)|
| 0:18:35| and we've always done this in an orderly fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| And if it is an emergency, we have a way of bringing it up as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| But if it's not an emergency, we just let anybody bring anything up at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| And then our commission is not functioning like it should be functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| But anyway, that's just my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| May I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| When you're doing this, that means you're next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Well, back in, you know, 2015, 2016, when I first got on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| we seemed like we had a lot of things show up right three minutes before the meeting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| And I believe, you know, and I would lean over to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Bud Armstrong and say, hey, have you even seen this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| And he'd say, well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| And so I think it was actually the chairmen's in that those time periods just refused to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| accept those last minute ones until it was approved by the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| Now, I think that was just handled between the chairman and the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| But I would appreciate it as a sitting commissioner just being able to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| a, you know, a resolution has been approved to form by the law director's office before we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| and supposed to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| And I think that's the thing that because the law department wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| elected to do that, to make sure that they're handling all legal actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| That says in this job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1208)|
| 0:20:16| But anyway, that's why I brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| It's just a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Should we do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Or will we just go ahead and do what we've always done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Should we make some sort of guidelines for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| And I just feel like the chair just sets the culture of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| So if that, I mean, it is what it is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| I mean, it's been happening since I've been a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| So, I mean, it does get frustrating, but, you know, that's just part of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| I think the whole body has a chance to stop at any point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| Yeah, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1253)|
| 0:20:53| We have a problem, but it's our culture to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| So it's not like, you know, I'm not so frustrated that I'm like, I don't want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| It's just adapting to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| I think I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| I would agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| Also, I really hesitate to totally tie, and I know this has been the rules and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1268)|
| 0:21:16| but I am a little bit nervous about restricting us to the point that that freedom is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| Well, I'm just thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| If we're going to do it, maybe instead of just adding it to the agenda and then say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| we approve the agenda as done, it's to vote on that particular item to say we want it on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| we don't want it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| It's just-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1301)|
| 0:21:41| Okay, that's not what you started out saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| I know, but what I'm saying is, is some way that we are not automatically just here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| take it, but we ought to be able to pull it out, look at it, talk about it, then vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| Instead of just putting it in as consent, put it on-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| But we have that power now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| I know you have that power now, but there again, we kind of just kind of let it slide by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1321)|
| 0:22:09| Well, but what we have the rules and then we have the power to do something about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| If nobody does anything, it doesn't mean we need another rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| We just need people to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| We just need to let them know that, you know, if one person objects to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| is it just a majority vote to put it on there or do you have to have a specific number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1342)|
| 0:22:31| Well, I think our rules are pretty clear about if you add something-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| It's still at the discretion of the chair, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Yeah, you still have to call for a vote to add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1359)|
| 0:22:40| I think it's just a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| And we've done that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Just a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Yeah, anyway, it just was kind of bothersome to me at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Anyway, I just thought I'd bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Okay, we'll move on to item number- what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| Six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| I'm bringing this up because I had a personal question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| about the money we spent on where we went, where we've been going on these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| meetings, like we go to TCCA, TCCSA, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| And we do have to go to some of them because we have to have continuing education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| and you get those if you get credit for those going to those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| But it says, any commissioner who is attending outside the conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| and this is the one that's before you right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| attends the conference shall submit to the commission office a copy of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| of all meetings attending as part of the conference within 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| after returning back from the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| And we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| It's real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| If you remember, when you go to these committee meetings, you will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1422)|
| 0:23:49| on the back of it, you have a copy for people that you sign up for those committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| and that you're there and you get checked off for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| It's very simple to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| Also, it says, any commissioner who registers to attend an outside conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1440)|
| 0:24:08| but cancels after the time allowed to receive a refund on the conference registration fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1448)|
| 0:24:16| and hotel reservations, if any, shall reimburse Knox County for the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1456)|
| 0:24:24| of this registration fee and hotel unless cancellation is due to an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| Sometimes we do have these emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| And we have to make our reservations so far in advance to where we can get the hotel rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| where we're there at the conference, and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| And I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| And we put them on our schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| If we go on there and say, you know what, I need something to do locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1486)|
| 0:24:53| then if we committed for that, we pay for it unless it's an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| something happens in the family that you can't go or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| then I think we need to reimburse the county for that fee that we trust the taxpayers for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1501)|
| 0:25:11| Does that happen often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| Is that a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| I mean, I know there's probably always an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| But I mean, it's not like we've got two or three every conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| No, it doesn't happen every conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| But it does happen occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| There's always a deadline to cancel in order to get a portion of the refund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1526)|
| 0:25:32| And then otherwise, you lose out that registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| I've never known of having to pay for a hotel fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| because usually you have to cancel within 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| But if you do not, you have to pay at least normally one night's hotel fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| And the other thing about these things, when you turn these in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| somebody asked me, said, you know, you go to all these conferences, what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| And I keep all mine, every one I go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| So I went to a meeting, I said, here, here's what I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| You have people that's already after you for things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| And you've got to say, right, here it is, this is where I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| And this is what we talked about, because there's new agenda on the other side right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| And that's not anything if somebody calls in and asks Drew, well, they went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| did they attend, did they go to the meetings and things of that sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Well, right here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| You can show those people, show that we're using their money properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| So under that, I have a question under that sort of guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1592)|
| 0:26:39| would then you penalize commissioners that go to the conference and don't attend all of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1599)|
| 0:26:45| Because I mean, I've been to conferences where people show up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| the first meeting and on a two or three day thing, and you never see them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1607)|
| 0:26:51| If they don't turn in their reports in 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| do you then penalize them for not attending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| What if they attend one out of every nine meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| I mean-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1619)|
| 0:26:59| Well, if you're going to go to the meeting and you committed to the taxpayer out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| should you go to the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Well, that's the question I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| What if Commissioner X signs up for a two day conference and goes to one meeting out of ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| Who's going to be the police to say you didn't go to the other nine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| you owe us a nine part pro rata of the registration fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| I think it gets into what qualifies as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| Who's going to determine that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| I mean, I think this is a rule looking for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| If we don't have a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| Well, I know you're going to be on a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1655)|
| 0:27:42| On the bylaws committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Bylaws committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| So you get activated, you go to all the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| If you're just down there and you go to one, hey, we have transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| we have governmental affairs, we have veterans affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| We have all these other committees that you can go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| and they're staggered to where you can go to all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| So if you're just going to go down there for one meeting, then-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| Well, I agree, but that's under this sort of premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| You either go and you attend it all or you're going to owe some money back to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| And who's going to be the police for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| It's only the registration part if you don't go at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| It's part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Yeah, I think that, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1705)|
| 0:28:25| I think what the legislative intent is, is just on the first paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| if you go to that conference and then 30 days later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| you take that agenda and you circle on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| You said I attended this meeting, this meeting, this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| Now you have a public record of Commissioner X went to nine meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| Commissioner Y only went to two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| But then the second paragraph means is if you don't go to that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| and the registration fee is $100, $200, you pay that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| They're not going to prorate just because you only went to two meetings instead of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Well, they're not going to, but this rule implies that somebody will be the watchdog| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| of all the missionaries that go to conferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| And if they're not attending all of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| then they're going to be owing something to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Well, no, it doesn't say that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Well, no, but that's what you're saying at the beginning of-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| There's no financial penalty on the first paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| It's just saying-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1761)|
| 0:29:21| But what happens if you don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| If you just go to the conference and never go to any of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| there's going to be a record of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| If somebody wants, some citizen wants to come in the commission office and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| hey, I'd like to see the travel for Commissioner X.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| And then they find out the guy went there or a girl went there for two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| and then didn't even attend the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Then I believe the press would have some fun with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Well, but this implies that, like, this implies malfeasance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| And that implies that, like, what happens if you don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| If somebody just goes, oh, I went to the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1792)|
| 0:29:54| It was really interesting, but I didn't submit a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| But I was asking you if you submitted a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Right here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| I know, but you're saying-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Right here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| So what if somebody doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| I mean, a rule has to have a consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| So if you're going to make a rule and somebody goes, eh, what's the consequence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Well, I think it kind of goes back to the same thing with commissioner training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| where the state posts the name of the commissioner and whether he did his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| seven hours of mandatory training or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| It's their public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| So if somebody's going to oppose that commissioner, when they come up for re-election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| they can say, hey, this guy never got his training that's required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| So-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1834)|
| 0:30:34| There's no penalty for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Penalty, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| No financial penalty, but the penalty could be at the polling place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| And the thing is, is if somebody calls in here and we're over our budget right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| now for travel expenses, we're over our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| OK, show me why this is important, why you travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| And if you don't go down there to learn something from these other commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| and you're not doing the meetings, I'm not going to be the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| that writes a ticket that says you need to show up to meetings or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| But the public has a right to know how we're spending their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| And we've got to show them that we're using it when we're down there at those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| that we're going to the meetings, we're in those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| and we're learning something and we're bringing something back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| I have these things since the first meeting I ever went to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| and I wasn't even on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| I ever filed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Other places that I did because I thought it was important for me to be trained and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| me to discuss with other commissioners in other areas and build these reports that we have with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| them so what we do, even like we talked about the other day when we're doing this plan for Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Knoxville, Knox County, one of my things was how are we going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| encompass other counties around us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1916)|
| 0:31:58| That's where you make the connections and how we can work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| So, and we just show the public, hey, we really think this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| This is very important business that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| And if we don't care, hey, right here's the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| But right now, if you're elected as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| there's actually zero requirement legally, unless I'm misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| There's zero requirement that you attend a single commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| You don't have to reimburse the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| If you don't actually come, if you get elected and you get sworn in on September 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| you do not show up at a single meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| You don't have to reimburse the county for the money that you receive as a commissioner if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| do zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Right, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| So you're accountable to the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| You're accountable to the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| But this rule heads towards if you don't do something or fulfill the whole duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| then you owe it, you got to pay Knox County back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| I mean, that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| You got to reimburse Knox County back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1977)|
| 0:32:59| If you sign up for it, you say I'm committed to go to that meeting, then you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| hey, I can do whatever I want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| It's just my thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Hey, I can mess these taxpayers up and spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| Well, then you're accountable to the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| I guess that's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| That's the big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| You're accountable for that tax dollars that you spend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Well, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| You're accountable every minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| That's between you and the voter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=1999)|
| 0:33:20| Yeah, I think we're doing ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Yeah, just your personal ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Because then I get into what qualifies as emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| And look, quite frankly, I don't know if this was brought up because of the last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| that I missed, that I signed up for, and if that was the specificity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| But I had a work emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| And I'm sorry, I have a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| It's different for those who have a full-time commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| I wouldn't have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I wouldn't have said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| But that won't qualify as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| So are you-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Okay, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| I think it's looking for a problem that doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| So your emergency, you get elected by the country, and they put their trust in you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| giving you their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| And you say, well, I have a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Well, hey, I took this job over-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| This is not-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| But I'm not getting into this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| But you're just saying my work is more important than the government work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| No, but I'm saying a work emergency may be more important than going to a conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2053)|
| 0:34:18| It may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| In my case, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| And I didn't go to the conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| I know that there have been other conferences that, according to how this rule is heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| down, the tenor of this rule is, I know I've been to other conferences where a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| shows up for the first meeting, and you don't see him for two and a half more days, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| they're having a great vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| Does that mean I'm supposed to be the commissioner of police and say you owe 80% of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| registration fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2083)|
| 0:34:43| Okay, so you're not going to be responsible for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| No, that's not-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| That's what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| That's what you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| We all work really hard at being responsible every single day to the public, but this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| like creating a rule of having a time police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| It's a rule looking for a problem, and we don't have a problem right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| I mean, our staff is not reporting that we have a major issue where 11 commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| sign up for conferences and then just don't show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| So you're saying you don't want any record of short how the money was spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| Well, I think you should have a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| You submit that time, and you submit that expense, and you go, and if your constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| and your voters say, tell me why you went to this conference and spent my money, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| you should be able to be able to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| But you have a record of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| All you bring is this back or, you know, and just click fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2133)|
| 0:35:41| That's what we're saying that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| You be responsible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| And Charlie, we each of us carry that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Every single commissioner handles their role and their duties differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| I mean, you want to lay it out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| We've got commissioners that basically make this practically a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| And we've got others that do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| But it is not up to me to account for someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2170)|
| 0:36:20| I will account for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| If someone has a question, I will deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| I am a mature, responsible individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| And if you have a problem, you bring it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| I don't need a watch, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| And that's really what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Do you think it's a watchdog to say to the public out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| I've got these things that are over our budget, and they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| well, what do you do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| And you say, right here's written proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| Listen, when they come and ask me about it, I'll deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| I'll handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| But in the meantime, Larson is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| What are you going to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| I mean, is the chairman of the board going to be the one that has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| oh, but you pay back, you pay that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| You're going to make Driscilla write a letter and say, you owe back, you owe back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| I mean, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| We are accountable to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| Not to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| And to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Yes, who are constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| So we're saying the same thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| But I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| I do support Larson in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| I just think that-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| I just brought this up to bring a situation that I was asked for the first time about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| what was going on, OK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| And I said, hey, I have no problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| Here's what we did, here's what we talked about, and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| And it would be easier if somebody calls in and says, can we have some records about your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| travels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| And all we do is we put in the expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| We send what our expenses are, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Mileage and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| For the record, yeah, to the finance office, it's your mileage and your per diem and old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| tote, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| And I'm asking, do you hang on to the agenda of the meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| I mean, the information that's sent to you that you forward to us, I mean, that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| that's readily accessible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Yeah, everything that I send you regarding cars is, yes, I have one on file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| But not the records for the meetings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2307)|
| 0:38:34| I just don't think we can police everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I'm not going to be the police, and I don't want to be the police or have her to be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| What I'm saying is, if somebody asks, would it be easier to say, here's the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2324)|
| 0:38:52| I don't see this as a necessary rule to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| OK, we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| It's not going to be a rule, so we won't have a motion for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| And we should move on to the next agenda item, which will be, I guess, the one for Carson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Do you want to handle that, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| Yes, sir, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| Commissioner Daly has done a great job of trying to clean up our agenda, and he's made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| some great improvements with the Rules Committee's assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| And one of the best things we ever did was do the education and general government consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| calendar, but we still left something in the minutes about an asterisk in front of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| So this is just some cleanup language to remove the asterisk from the item that's on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2376)|
| 0:39:44| because when you're listing it already on consent, there's no reason to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| So it just makes the agenda look cleaner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Is the format now that it's now broken up to this is just the consent part, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| this is the regular agenda part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Education consent, and then general government consent, and then the full agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2398)|
| 0:40:05| And then this would also put it into one bucket where you wouldn't do each one separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| you would just do one motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| I don't know what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| Is there, as far as you record the keepers, is there any reason that that would make any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2418)|
| 0:40:26| difference to what you all have to record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2426)|
| 0:40:33| We like the part that we don't have to read anymore, so we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| It does make the meeting go smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2436)|
| 0:40:47| So what we're doing right here is we're going to do as amended, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| Yeah, I guess your motion would be as presented, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| As presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I'll make the motion as presented for absentee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Mr. David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2469)|
| 0:41:09| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| We have it affirmed that we'll do Mr. Bailey's meeting here, and I hope he gets better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| He's getting real sore is what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| I did say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| I think we're having like every, is it every second or third month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| I think that's what you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| It'll be June, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| If it is June, it'll have to be moved to that Tuesday because the Monday will be Juneteenth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2498)|
| 0:41:44| celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220321-rules-committee?start=2504)|
