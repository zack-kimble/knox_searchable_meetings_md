| 6:33:33| I don't know Mr. Coffey personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23613)|
| 6:33:36| So when I say this, it isn't because he's my best friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23616)|
| 6:33:39| but I cannot tell you, Mr. Coffey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23619)|
| 6:33:41| how much you were appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23621)|
| 6:33:43| in the very kind and constructive way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23623)|
| 6:33:45| that you addressed this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23625)|
| 6:33:48| and the appreciation that you showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23628)|
| 6:33:52| And it's back at you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23632)|
| 6:33:56| To Ms. King and I believe it was Ms. Taylor's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23636)|
| 6:34:04| during public forum about school sports issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23644)|
| 6:34:08| Ultimately, of course, that will be the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23648)|
| 6:34:13| that will put out their feelings toward this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23653)|
| 6:34:19| But I did want to reflect back on the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23659)|
| 6:34:23| that was presented by the Board of Health regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23663)|
| 6:34:27| And there's nothing in the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23667)|
| 6:34:32| from the Board of Health that states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23672)|
| 6:34:33| that we will not have spring sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23673)|
| 6:34:39| even that we should not have spring sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23679)|
| 6:34:41| I read it verbatim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23681)|
| 6:34:43| It says, to reduce the opportunity for the spread of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23683)|
| 6:34:49| the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23689)|
| 6:34:51| is encouraged to limit extracurricular activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23691)|
| 6:34:55| for the spring of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23695)|
| 6:34:58| That doesn't say don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23698)|
| 6:35:00| That merely talks about considering limiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23700)|
| 6:35:06| And if extracurricular activities continue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23706)|
| 6:35:10| enact appropriate safety precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23710)|
| 6:35:14| So just a point of reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23714)|
| 6:35:17| that's a very different from what some of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23717)|
| 6:35:21| were saying about the Board of Health's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23721)|
| 6:35:25| to do away with spring sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23725)|
| 6:35:28| So on those notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23728)|
| 6:35:33| I go back to what I said three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23733)|
| 6:35:37| I think when Mr. Ward's first resolution came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23737)|
| 6:35:44| and we did hear several speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23744)|
| 6:35:47| really on both sides of the issue say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23747)|
| 6:35:51| the time to make change is not in the middle of crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23751)|
| 6:35:55| We have done a lot wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23755)|
| 6:35:58| but we've done some things right too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23758)|
| 6:36:01| And anybody anywhere will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23761)|
| 6:36:05| that when you are in turmoil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23765)|
| 6:36:09| that is not when you turn around and make drastic changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23769)|
| 6:36:15| This in fact would be a drastic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23775)|
| 6:36:17| So I just want to caution the board about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23777)|
| 6:36:26| There has been a lot of incorrect information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23786)|
| 6:36:28| that's gone out on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23788)|
| 6:36:32| One of the speakers used the word messy, messy information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23792)|
| 6:36:36| and it has been messy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23796)|
| 6:36:39| And that doesn't speak to one side over the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23799)|
| 6:36:43| because it addresses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23803)|
| 6:36:46| I think it addresses both sides equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23806)|
| 6:36:49| It goes back to what many of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23809)|
| 6:36:52| who have worked in advocating for one particular cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23812)|
| 6:36:58| or side over another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23818)|
| 6:36:59| in that you can get numbers to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23819)|
| 6:37:02| just about anything you want them to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23822)|
| 6:37:05| And I think very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23825)|
| 6:37:06| this is what we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23826)|
| 6:37:08| not only in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23828)|
| 6:37:10| but nationwide and probably worldwide too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23830)|
| 6:37:12| So just again, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23832)|
| 6:37:14| just please keep that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23834)|
| 6:37:16| regardless of where you fall on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23836)|
| 6:37:18| when we hear statistics to measure the sources carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23838)|
| 6:37:24| As I said last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23844)|
| 6:37:27| a transfer of regulatory authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23847)|
| 6:37:32| from a board of health of 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23852)|
| 6:37:37| I believe they are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23857)|
| 6:37:38| down to one still has an unelected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23858)|
| 6:37:45| making the decisions for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23865)|
| 6:37:47| You can agree or disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23867)|
| 6:37:49| but our medical director is an unelected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23869)|
| 6:37:53| An unelected person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23873)|
| 6:37:56| I will point out again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23876)|
| 6:37:57| that Dr. Buchanan has in fact supported every decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23877)|
| 6:38:02| to this point that the board of health has made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23882)|
| 6:38:05| So again, to change where we are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23885)|
| 6:38:09| with the regulatory process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23889)|
| 6:38:11| and transfer it from a group to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23891)|
| 6:38:15| knowing, and I don't mean to speak for you, Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23895)|
| 6:38:19| but knowing that she appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23899)|
| 6:38:21| to have heard the recommendations of her colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23901)|
| 6:38:25| most of them medical and in fact made the decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23905)|
| 6:38:33| it appears would probably make the same decision individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23913)|
| 6:38:38| that the board would collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23918)|
| 6:38:42| is something that we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23922)|
| 6:38:45| There is no taking the politics out of it, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23925)|
| 6:38:49| I don't care if that position is elected or unelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23929)|
| 6:38:54| Make no mistake, our medical director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23934)|
| 6:38:57| and our department of health administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23937)|
| 6:39:05| both of which Dr. Buchanan are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23945)|
| 6:39:07| do answer to our mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23947)|
| 6:39:10| And there's some debate about whether that position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23950)|
| 6:39:14| can be hired and fired solely by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23954)|
| 6:39:19| Whether Dr. Peercy has input into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23959)|
| 6:39:23| that really is almost irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23963)|
| 6:39:25| The bottom line is it is a political appointment, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23965)|
| 6:39:33| So there's no matter, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23973)|
| 6:39:35| which side of the fence you fall on, it's political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23975)|
| 6:39:41| At the moment, if we concede that there is politics involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23981)|
| 6:39:49| and you support our mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23989)|
| 6:39:51| which very much I do and agree with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23991)|
| 6:39:55| so that kind of makes it all good then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23995)|
| 6:39:58| But if you did not support the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=23998)|
| 6:40:01| you would feel differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24001)|
| 6:40:02| So again, we still go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24002)|
| 6:40:04| to the political ramifications of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24004)|
| 6:40:08| On the issue of this is unconstitutional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24008)|
| 6:40:14| I am not a constitutional attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24014)|
| 6:40:18| I will tell you constitutional attorneys disagree on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24018)|
| 6:40:22| I think to make the widespread statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24022)|
| 6:40:26| about its constitutionality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24026)|
| 6:40:28| given just like our medical profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24028)|
| 6:40:31| our legal profession is on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24031)|
| 6:40:35| I believe probably ultimately this is an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24035)|
| 6:40:38| that will be decided by our Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24038)|
| 6:40:43| is probably where this whole thing's going to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24043)|
| 6:40:45| So whether you believe it is or is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24045)|
| 6:40:49| please keep in mind too that there are professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24049)|
| 6:40:52| and experts on both sides of this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24052)|
| 6:40:55| that would argue it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24055)|
| 6:40:58| In closing to Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24058)|
| 6:41:02| I heard you say your goal was to try to find something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24062)|
| 6:41:06| that was going to unify or try to help bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24066)|
| 6:41:11| the people of Knox County together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24071)|
| 6:41:17| Ultimately that is the goal of every single one of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24077)|
| 6:41:21| I don't know what that answer is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24081)|
| 6:41:24| but I feel fairly certain I can tell you what it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24084)|
| 6:41:29| Right now we know what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24089)|
| 6:41:32| We have people that are happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24092)|
| 6:41:33| we have people that are unhappy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24093)|
| 6:41:35| but we know what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24095)|
| 6:41:37| I am very, very concerned if we turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24097)|
| 6:41:42| and make a decision like this right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24102)|
| 6:41:44| in the midst of this crisis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24104)|
| 6:41:46| when there's so much division that we already know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24106)|
| 6:41:51| it is not going to make any division or conflict go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24111)|
| 6:41:57| In fact, I would suggest to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24117)|
| 6:42:00| that it probably would only make it even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24120)|
| 6:42:05| And for all of those reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24125)|
| 6:42:07| I cannot support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24127)|
| 6:42:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24130)|
| 6:42:11| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24131)|
| 6:42:12| I see Martha Buchanan raised her hand during your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24132)|
| 6:42:16| Dr. Buchanan, would you like to address commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24136)|
| 6:42:19| Then I'll go to Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24139)|
| 6:42:21| and be alert after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24141)|
| 6:42:23| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24143)|
| 6:42:24| Thank you, Chairman Jay, and thank you, commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24144)|
| 6:42:28| for your attention to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24148)|
| 6:42:31| I just wanna read some data and make some statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24151)|
| 6:42:35| and then I actually have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24155)|
| 6:42:36| So, 8,782 cases of COVID have occurred since December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24156)|
| 6:42:44| That's 32% of all of our cases of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24164)|
| 6:42:48| since December 1st, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24168)|
| 6:42:51| There's an average of 418 cases every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24171)|
| 6:42:56| compared to an average of 185 cases per day in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24176)|
| 6:43:02| 70 deaths have occurred since December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24182)|
| 6:43:07| That's 26% of all deaths of Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24187)|
| 6:43:11| since December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24191)|
| 6:43:14| Average of 3.3 deaths every day since December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24194)|
| 6:43:21| In November and December, 158 people have died from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24201)|
| 6:43:27| This is 59.4% of the deaths reported in 51 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24207)|
| 6:43:34| So, we're not in a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24214)|
| 6:43:37| And I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24217)|
| 6:43:41| this is deciding who has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24221)|
| 6:43:45| to make decisions right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24225)|
| 6:43:48| is like confronting a wildfire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24228)|
| 6:43:51| and arguing over who needs to hold the hose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24231)|
| 6:43:56| It's not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24236)|
| 6:43:59| It's just, I acknowledge there are differing thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24239)|
| 6:44:03| about the path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24243)|
| 6:44:04| There are differing thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24244)|
| 6:44:06| about elected and unelected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24246)|
| 6:44:10| But right now is not the time to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24250)|
| 6:44:14| It's a critical time that we should come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24254)|
| 6:44:17| as a community in a unified approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24257)|
| 6:44:21| to address our worst and worsening reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24261)|
| 6:44:27| we've seen ever in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24267)|
| 6:44:31| Tennessee is the epicenter of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24271)|
| 6:44:35| Knox County is the epicenter within Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24275)|
| 6:44:39| We don't need to change things at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24279)|
| 6:44:42| It just breeds confusion and distrust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24282)|
| 6:44:46| and uncertainty among our citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24286)|
| 6:44:48| and among those who need information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24288)|
| 6:44:52| The Board of Health is a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24292)|
| 6:44:54| of very dedicated professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24294)|
| 6:44:56| who are making thoughtful decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24296)|
| 6:44:59| If you've watched their meetings, they're thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24299)|
| 6:45:01| We debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24301)|
| 6:45:03| We don't just put out edicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24303)|
| 6:45:07| These are the worst numbers we've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24307)|
| 6:45:09| And I would argue that it's just not the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24309)|
| 6:45:12| to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24312)|
| 6:45:14| And also, Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24314)|
| 6:45:18| putting the decision in my lap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24318)|
| 6:45:21| which is what you said will happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24321)|
| 6:45:25| I voted for everything the Board of Health has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24325)|
| 6:45:28| And if we go back and look at my previous record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24328)|
| 6:45:32| before the County Law Office said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24332)|
| 6:45:34| the Board of Health had to make these decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24334)|
| 6:45:36| I actually was the first to put in place a stay-at-home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24336)|
| 6:45:41| or safer-at-home order and closed businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24341)|
| 6:45:45| honestly, even before Governor Lee did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24345)|
| 6:45:47| So it's not like things are gonna change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24347)|
| 6:45:51| if the decisions are in my court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24351)|
| 6:45:53| So that kind of leads me to my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24353)|
| 6:45:56| to Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24356)|
| 6:45:58| How do you see this playing out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24358)|
| 6:46:00| If the Board of Health is advisory to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24360)|
| 6:46:03| and the decision-making is up to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24363)|
| 6:46:06| how do you see this playing out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24366)|
| 6:46:08| What are the limitations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24368)|
| 6:46:10| I'm not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24370)|
| 6:46:12| I am appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24372)|
| 6:46:14| And I will continue to make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24374)|
| 6:46:17| that I believe are in the best interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24377)|
| 6:46:19| of the public health of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24379)|
| 6:46:22| And that doesn't matter if they're popular or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24382)|
| 6:46:26| And my job is to protect health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24386)|
| 6:46:28| I have to think about other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24388)|
| 6:46:29| I have to think about economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24389)|
| 6:46:30| which is why we're not shutting things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24390)|
| 6:46:33| But my job is to protect the health of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24393)|
| 6:46:35| And right now, 3.33 Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24395)|
| 6:46:41| are dying every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24401)|
| 6:46:45| That breaks my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24405)|
| 6:46:47| And so how do you think changing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24407)|
| 6:46:51| is gonna help the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24411)|
| 6:46:53| It doesn't change COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24413)|
| 6:46:54| COVID is gonna be the same as it always has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24414)|
| 6:46:57| So Commissioner Ward, how do you see this playing out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24417)|
| 6:47:00| If the Board of Health becomes advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24420)|
| 6:47:03| what do you see is happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24423)|
| 6:47:06| The response you just, or the statement you just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24426)|
| 6:47:09| is exactly what I expect from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24429)|
| 6:47:11| And you have my support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24431)|
| 6:47:12| I'm not a medical professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24432)|
| 6:47:14| I'm not a medical expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24434)|
| 6:47:17| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24437)|
| 6:47:18| So whatever you decide, I'll support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24438)|
| 6:47:21| I've said that from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24441)|
| 6:47:22| this is a constitutional thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24442)|
| 6:47:24| I've said it from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24444)|
| 6:47:26| Two to five core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24446)|
| 6:47:27| I've told you in private and in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24447)|
| 6:47:30| that I wear a mask, not necessarily against masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24450)|
| 6:47:33| So I support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24453)|
| 6:47:38| Thank you, Dr. McKinnon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24458)|
| 6:47:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24459)|
| 6:47:41| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24461)|
| 6:47:44| This question is to Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24464)|
| 6:47:46| if he is still available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24466)|
| 6:47:48| since Commissioner Hill brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24468)|
| 6:47:53| Mayor Jacobs, are you still with us or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24473)|
| 6:47:55| Yes, Commissioner, I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24475)|
| 6:47:57| Oh, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24477)|
| 6:47:59| There's been some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24479)|
| 6:48:02| there's been some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24482)|
| 6:48:03| both on social media and emails and phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24483)|
| 6:48:08| And then now Commissioner Hill brought it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24488)|
| 6:48:12| about your authority to replace Martha Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24492)|
| 6:48:16| Do you wanna set the record straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24496)|
| 6:48:18| on what your authority would be on that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24498)|
| 6:48:22| As far as my authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24502)|
| 6:48:23| that would be a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24503)|
| 6:48:26| As far as by what I would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24506)|
| 6:48:28| I have no intentions of replacing Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24508)|
| 6:48:32| So really that points moot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24512)|
| 6:48:35| But as far as a legal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24515)|
| 6:48:38| you'd have to defer to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24518)|
| 6:48:39| I'd have to defer to the law department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24519)|
| 6:48:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24522)|
| 6:48:44| And then also it's been said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24524)|
| 6:48:47| if we went from a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24527)|
| 6:48:50| to an advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24530)|
| 6:48:52| that all health decisions will be made from your office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24532)|
| 6:48:58| No, as far as the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24538)|
| 6:49:01| is technically under Knox County, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24541)|
| 6:49:04| But as Dr. Buchanan pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24544)|
| 6:49:08| under the governor's executive order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24548)|
| 6:49:10| she has the ability and the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24550)|
| 6:49:13| to issue health orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24553)|
| 6:49:15| which she did previous to the board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24555)|
| 6:49:18| taking over that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24558)|
| 6:49:20| So it would, they actually come from Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24560)|
| 6:49:24| And you still have confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24564)|
| 6:49:26| In her role as public health director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24566)|
| 6:49:30| And you still have confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24570)|
| 6:49:32| in the way she made her decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24572)|
| 6:49:34| Yeah, we have, as Dr. Buchanan and I have discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24574)|
| 6:49:37| I think our jobs are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24577)|
| 6:49:42| but she is very good at her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24582)|
| 6:49:48| And someone should not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24588)|
| 6:49:51| if you're asking should someone be punished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24591)|
| 6:49:53| for doing their job, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24593)|
| 6:49:55| She's done a great job throughout this whole episode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24595)|
| 6:49:59| And it's been very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24599)|
| 6:50:00| One thing that I am concerned about is putting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24600)|
| 6:50:07| as one of the speakers said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24607)|
| 6:50:09| putting a lot more pressure on her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24609)|
| 6:50:10| and what that would do to her personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24610)|
| 6:50:15| And that's an issue for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24615)|
| 6:50:18| just with my personal relationship with Dr. Bate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24618)|
| 6:50:21| So, do I have confidence her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24621)|
| 6:50:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24625)|
| 6:50:27| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24627)|
| 6:50:28| And then this question is for the maker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24628)|
| 6:50:31| of the ordinance, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24631)|
| 6:50:35| It's still my understanding that in the 94 other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24635)|
| 6:50:40| in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24640)|
| 6:50:42| that the direction for those individual counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24642)|
| 6:50:48| is either coming from the state board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24648)|
| 6:50:52| or the director of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24652)|
| 6:50:55| or the public health official for that county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24655)|
| 6:50:58| that we are the only county in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24658)|
| 6:51:01| that is not abiding by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24661)|
| 6:51:03| Is that still correct at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24663)|
| 6:51:05| Correct, from my research, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24665)|
| 6:51:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24668)|
| 6:51:09| If I may clarify, for the other metropolitan counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24669)|
| 6:51:14| they have task forces that are organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24674)|
| 6:51:20| made up of business officials and health officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24680)|
| 6:51:23| and the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24683)|
| 6:51:24| and the city and county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24684)|
| 6:51:29| that are making the decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24689)|
| 6:51:30| not just the health official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24690)|
| 6:51:33| But are they in an advisory role or are they mandating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24693)|
| 6:51:37| and then the director of health is rubber stamping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24697)|
| 6:51:40| what they're mandating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24700)|
| 6:51:43| They are, you have to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24703)|
| 6:51:47| It looks like it's a task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24707)|
| 6:51:48| that they're talking together and making decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24708)|
| 6:51:51| much like we do on the board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24711)|
| 6:51:55| Okay, but they're still the ultimate person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24715)|
| 6:51:57| that the same as your position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24717)|
| 6:51:59| that still makes the final decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24719)|
| 6:52:01| is my understanding at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24721)|
| 6:52:03| I can't speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24723)|
| 6:52:04| I'm not sure how that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24724)|
| 6:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24727)|
| 6:52:08| And let's see, the other thing that I wanted to clarify too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24728)|
| 6:52:13| oh, yeah, there was an implication from one of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24733)|
| 6:52:17| that if we went to an advisory board of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24737)|
| 6:52:22| that then all of a sudden Knox County would be left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24742)|
| 6:52:26| in the hands of amateurs making health decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24746)|
| 6:52:31| And I too, like most of my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24751)|
| 6:52:33| have a immense amount of appreciation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24753)|
| 6:52:36| for what Dr. Buchanan and the 250 plus employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24756)|
| 6:52:41| of our Knox County Health Department are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24761)|
| 6:52:44| So I don't call any of them amateurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24764)|
| 6:52:47| And I still believe that Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24767)|
| 6:52:53| should be making the decisions for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24773)|
| 6:52:57| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24777)|
| 6:52:59| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker, Commissioner Buehler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24779)|
| 6:53:02| and then Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24782)|
| 6:53:07| And you are on mute, Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24787)|
| 6:53:13| Sorry, I took my hand down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24793)|
| 6:53:14| but didn't hit the unmute button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24794)|
| 6:53:17| A lot of good things have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24797)|
| 6:53:19| I'm just trying to process all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24799)|
| 6:53:22| Especially, you know, I appreciate what Dr. Buchanan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24802)|
| 6:53:26| You know, the numbers are sobering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24806)|
| 6:53:30| I appreciate what Commissioner Hill said too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24810)|
| 6:53:33| And I want to start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24813)|
| 6:53:35| Commissioner Hill, I believe, made a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24815)|
| 6:53:38| something to the effect of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24818)|
| 6:53:39| you can't take politics out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24819)|
| 6:53:42| I wholeheartedly agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24822)|
| 6:53:44| You can't, I know people love to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24824)|
| 6:53:45| Man, that is a popular thing to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24825)|
| 6:53:49| Let's take politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24829)|
| 6:53:51| Guys, look, you can't take politics out of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24831)|
| 6:53:54| any more than you can take religion out of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24834)|
| 6:53:56| or personality out of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24836)|
| 6:53:58| Politics is part of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24838)|
| 6:54:02| It's part of how our country works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24842)|
| 6:54:04| It's part of how we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24844)|
| 6:54:05| It's part of what we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24845)|
| 6:54:07| So no, you don't take politics out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24847)|
| 6:54:11| That being said, politics doesn't necessarily determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24851)|
| 6:54:15| where people come down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24855)|
| 6:54:16| Our community is very divided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24856)|
| 6:54:18| and it's hard to find a rhyme or reason to the division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24858)|
| 6:54:21| Anecdotally, very quickly, I'll give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24861)|
| 6:54:25| I had a gentleman, a constituent in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24865)|
| 6:54:28| that is as red state, conservative, to the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24868)|
| 6:54:32| as anybody you would ever meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24872)|
| 6:54:35| And in my conversation with him about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24875)|
| 6:54:37| it was, don't you touch that health board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24877)|
| 6:54:39| You don't know anything about my health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24879)|
| 6:54:41| County commission doesn't know anything about my health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24881)|
| 6:54:44| Got a phone call from a lady the other night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24884)|
| 6:54:47| who's had a very severe case of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24887)|
| 6:54:50| And she said, I just wanna know how you're gonna vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24890)|
| 6:54:52| on this health board ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24892)|
| 6:54:54| And I said, oh my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24894)|
| 6:54:56| And before I could get another word out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24896)|
| 6:54:57| she said, let me tell you how I want you to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24897)|
| 6:54:59| I want you to vote to make them advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24899)|
| 6:55:03| And this was a lady who had a severe case of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24903)|
| 6:55:06| And so people's personal experience with the virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24906)|
| 6:55:10| doesn't seem to determine where they come down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24910)|
| 6:55:14| People's politics doesn't always determine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24914)|
| 6:55:16| where they come down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24916)|
| 6:55:17| It's not just red versus blue or liberal conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24917)|
| 6:55:20| or had the virus, haven't had the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24920)|
| 6:55:22| I had a severe case of the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24922)|
| 6:55:25| I've had friends pass away from COVID related causes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24925)|
| 6:55:31| So as commissioner Ward said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24931)|
| 6:55:32| man, I support the five core actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24932)|
| 6:55:35| I implore people to take this virus seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24935)|
| 6:55:38| Wear a mask when you're supposed to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24938)|
| 6:55:42| Listen, I am OCD about washing and sanitizing my hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24942)|
| 6:55:48| This is a serious matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24948)|
| 6:55:51| I will say though, I do respectfully disagree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24951)|
| 6:55:57| that this is a drastic change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24957)|
| 6:56:00| I actually believe this is a reasonable change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24960)|
| 6:56:03| that is procedural in nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24963)|
| 6:56:06| and offers a more constitutional way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24966)|
| 6:56:11| of making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24971)|
| 6:56:14| What's happening now is an unelected non-legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24974)|
| 6:56:19| is making legislative decisions and that scares people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24979)|
| 6:56:27| What would unify us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24987)|
| 6:56:29| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24989)|
| 6:56:30| What would unify us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24990)|
| 6:56:31| Especially in this crazy situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24991)|
| 6:56:34| where we have people's opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24994)|
| 6:56:36| don't seem to have any discernible basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=24996)|
| 6:56:40| because of the whole conservative, liberal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25000)|
| 6:56:42| red, blue, religious, non-religious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25002)|
| 6:56:44| It doesn't seem to matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25004)|
| 6:56:46| It doesn't seem to determine necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25006)|
| 6:56:47| where they come down on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25007)|
| 6:56:49| So the division's difficult to navigate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25009)|
| 6:56:50| but what unifies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25010)|
| 6:56:54| And I think all of us would agree, trust is what unifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25014)|
| 6:56:59| And from my perspective, you may disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25019)|
| 6:57:01| but from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25021)|
| 6:57:04| there is much more public trust vested in Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25024)|
| 6:57:09| than in a panel of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25029)|
| 6:57:11| that perhaps through no fault of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25031)|
| 6:57:15| just trying to do their jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25035)|
| 6:57:17| but all of a sudden this power has been vested in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25037)|
| 6:57:20| that no one knew was vested in them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25040)|
| 6:57:22| that they really didn't ask for, but now they have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25042)|
| 6:57:24| and people are suspicious of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25044)|
| 6:57:27| and the trust factor, it is compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25047)|
| 6:57:31| And so I believe by making this incredibly qualified group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25051)|
| 6:57:36| of individuals, an advisory body to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25056)|
| 6:57:40| that the public looks at as someone they can trust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25060)|
| 6:57:44| who is an extension of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25064)|
| 6:57:47| as well as the state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25067)|
| 6:57:50| I believe that actually might serve to unify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25070)|
| 6:57:56| rather than to divide more deeply as some have suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25076)|
| 6:58:00| And I would say this in closing, this is a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25080)|
| 6:58:06| I think we might do a disservice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25086)|
| 6:58:08| if we didn't at least pass this on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25088)|
| 6:58:13| and see how things develop over the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25093)|
| 6:58:16| It's been suggested by many people don't do anything now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25096)|
| 6:58:20| Well, we can't do anything now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25100)|
| 6:58:23| but we can pass this ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25103)|
| 6:58:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25107)|
| 6:58:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25109)|
| 6:58:31| Dr. Buchanan, did you have a direct rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25111)|
| 6:58:34| to Commissioner Beeler before I go to Commissioner Lundy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25114)|
| 6:58:37| or do you have general comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25117)|
| 6:58:39| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25119)|
| 6:58:40| Commissioner Lundy, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25120)|
| 6:58:43| I really don't have too much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25123)|
| 6:58:45| I just wanna thank Commissioner Hill for her words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25125)|
| 6:58:48| I think we just have to operate in wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25128)|
| 6:58:51| Whatever we decide, this is our legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25131)|
| 6:58:54| I don't think that this is gonna change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25134)|
| 6:58:57| I think I do believe things will get worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25137)|
| 6:58:59| in a much divided community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25139)|
| 6:59:01| We will have a much divided community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25141)|
| 6:59:03| I just wanna remind us that as we are debating and debating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25143)|
| 6:59:08| someone else is probably dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25148)|
| 6:59:10| And I just wanna remind everybody that COVID is the enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25150)|
| 6:59:16| We are not each other's enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25156)|
| 6:59:18| And we have to focus on fighting COVID together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25158)|
| 6:59:23| The late Martin Luther King said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25163)|
| 6:59:25| where do we go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25165)|
| 6:59:27| Chaos our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25167)|
| 6:59:30| I choose community and we have to figure this thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25170)|
| 6:59:34| We should not be debating on people's lives right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25174)|
| 6:59:37| I lost a patient today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25177)|
| 6:59:40| With COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25180)|
| 6:59:43| I seen her as a surrogate parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25183)|
| 6:59:45| She loved me to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25185)|
| 6:59:46| She was 98 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25186)|
| 6:59:48| She was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25188)|
| 6:59:51| So I just want us to just be reminded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25191)|
| 6:59:54| that we are fighting COVID and that's the real enemy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25194)|
| 6:59:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25198)|
| 7:00:00| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25200)|
| 7:00:02| I have some comments I'd like to share as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25202)|
| 7:00:03| but Dr. Buchanan, I'd be happy to give you the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25203)|
| 7:00:07| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25207)|
| 7:00:08| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25208)|
| 7:00:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25209)|
| 7:00:11| If you guys know me by now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25211)|
| 7:00:13| I like to write down what I wanna say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25213)|
| 7:00:16| I like to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25216)|
| 7:00:17| I like to be thoughtful about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25217)|
| 7:00:19| So if you'll bear with me for a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25219)|
| 7:00:20| I've spent a good bit of time trying to process this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25220)|
| 7:00:25| First and foremost, I just wanna reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25225)|
| 7:00:27| and offer some comfort to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25227)|
| 7:00:29| that's really suffering from COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25229)|
| 7:00:32| There are a lot of families separated right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25232)|
| 7:00:35| from people that are fighting for their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25235)|
| 7:00:38| They're alone, they're in hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25238)|
| 7:00:40| They're in quarantine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25240)|
| 7:00:41| They're doing their part to stop the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25241)|
| 7:00:44| There's also a lot of families that are celebrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25244)|
| 7:00:47| with one less family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25247)|
| 7:00:49| It's really real and our condolences go out to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25249)|
| 7:00:53| Some of our colleagues really recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25253)|
| 7:00:57| Scott County Property Assessor, Tony Sexton, dead, COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25257)|
| 7:01:02| Madisonville Mayor, Glenn Moser, died, COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25262)|
| 7:01:07| Today's numbers are alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25267)|
| 7:01:12| This week's numbers are alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25272)|
| 7:01:14| This month's numbers are alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25274)|
| 7:01:18| I don't understand why we can't do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25278)|
| 7:01:22| For months, I have listened to every position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25282)|
| 7:01:25| in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25285)|
| 7:01:27| I have read and responded to close to 1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25287)|
| 7:01:30| constituent emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25290)|
| 7:01:32| There is a lot to digest and it is not to be joked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25292)|
| 7:01:38| As I read it in just a baseline sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25298)|
| 7:01:42| pulling back from the emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25302)|
| 7:01:43| and just looking at the black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25303)|
| 7:01:45| I don't believe this governing body has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25305)|
| 7:01:48| to set up a whole new advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25308)|
| 7:01:51| Thus, we can dissolve and choose to dissolve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25311)|
| 7:01:54| the current Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25314)|
| 7:01:55| which is essentially what this ordinance does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25315)|
| 7:01:58| in not so plain English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25318)|
| 7:02:01| But Tennessee state law does not grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25321)|
| 7:02:03| Knox County Commission the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25323)|
| 7:02:05| to create an advisory Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25325)|
| 7:02:07| It's really clear to me in TCA 68-601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25327)|
| 7:02:13| Section 90 says, in counties which fail to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25333)|
| 7:02:16| an active Board of Health pursuant to subsection A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25336)|
| 7:02:19| the commissioner of health may establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25339)|
| 7:02:21| a health advisory committee to function as provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25341)|
| 7:02:25| And however, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25345)|
| 7:02:28| retains all the powers and duties of the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25348)|
| 7:02:31| That's Dr. Buchanan, that is not us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25351)|
| 7:02:33| and she has not asked us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25353)|
| 7:02:36| There is absolutely nothing I can read in state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25356)|
| 7:02:38| that says this governing body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25358)|
| 7:02:40| may establish a health advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25360)|
| 7:02:43| We have been told numerous times by our law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25363)|
| 7:02:46| that state law supersedes us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25366)|
| 7:02:49| If it says we can't do it, then we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25369)|
| 7:02:53| Either you can by the state or you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25373)|
| 7:02:55| You can't have it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25375)|
| 7:02:57| This body has already moved to form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25377)|
| 7:02:59| a completely new health and advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25379)|
| 7:03:02| the Committee on Health and Economic Wellbeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25382)|
| 7:03:04| And that we can do, but not both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25384)|
| 7:03:07| Per state law, only the commissioner of health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25387)|
| 7:03:09| Dr. Buchanan, can establish one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25389)|
| 7:03:12| So separate of that, I just think on its face value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25392)|
| 7:03:15| if it was an ordinance to say dissolve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25395)|
| 7:03:17| that's one thing, but just to put both in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25397)|
| 7:03:20| I just don't think we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25400)|
| 7:03:21| But let me step back from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25401)|
| 7:03:25| When this pandemic began, our health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25405)|
| 7:03:27| issued basic health guidelines to educate people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25407)|
| 7:03:30| on how they could stay safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25410)|
| 7:03:31| That started with Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25411)|
| 7:03:33| and then went to the Board of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25413)|
| 7:03:36| And for a short time, that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25416)|
| 7:03:40| Then some began picking away at people's authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25420)|
| 7:03:43| and the credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25423)|
| 7:03:45| Many went back to normal and our cases and deaths rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25425)|
| 7:03:49| Then again, this fall, our health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25429)|
| 7:03:51| gave us dire warnings about the holidays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25431)|
| 7:03:54| about fall break, about Halloween, about Thanksgiving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25434)|
| 7:03:57| how to stay safe and how to avoid the situation we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25437)|
| 7:04:00| But here we are now, exactly where they told us, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25440)|
| 7:04:06| Remember just a few short years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25446)|
| 7:04:09| and I'm glad Dr. Buchanan mentioned this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25449)|
| 7:04:11| Think back to the wildfires that consumed our mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25451)|
| 7:04:15| They destroyed our businesses, they gutted homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25455)|
| 7:04:17| it cost $500 million in economic damages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25457)|
| 7:04:21| injured 190 people and took the lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25461)|
| 7:04:23| of 14 of our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25463)|
| 7:04:25| Do you remember that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25465)|
| 7:04:28| All that time, we put our trust in officials and agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25468)|
| 7:04:32| in a place to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25472)|
| 7:04:33| We rallied together as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25473)|
| 7:04:35| and called in the National Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25475)|
| 7:04:37| and other fire departments from hundreds of miles away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25477)|
| 7:04:40| The governors, the mayors, the federal agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25480)|
| 7:04:42| never superseded their authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25482)|
| 7:04:45| and never micromanaged the fire departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25485)|
| 7:04:47| during the battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25487)|
| 7:04:48| Our public fire structure did its job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25488)|
| 7:04:51| and it got things under control through measured approaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25491)|
| 7:04:54| experience and determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25494)|
| 7:04:56| and the public never gets them while they fought the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25496)|
| 7:05:00| Once extinguished, that's when everyone came together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25500)|
| 7:05:03| to analyze what can be done better in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25503)|
| 7:05:06| but not in the middle of the wildfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25506)|
| 7:05:09| This county and this state and this place we call home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25509)|
| 7:05:13| is on fire right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25513)|
| 7:05:16| While we were having this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25516)|
| 7:05:17| the White House today named Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25517)|
| 7:05:20| the number one city in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25520)|
| 7:05:25| for the spread of COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25525)|
| 7:05:27| Number one in the entire country came out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25527)|
| 7:05:32| That came from our White House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25532)|
| 7:05:35| Tennessee is the worst place in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25535)|
| 7:05:37| for the spread of COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25537)|
| 7:05:38| and here we are discussing how to sideline professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25538)|
| 7:05:41| with expertise and knowledge on basic health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25541)|
| 7:05:45| how to save our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25545)|
| 7:05:47| Frankly, I think that that's an embarrassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25547)|
| 7:05:49| and an insult to the 226 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25549)|
| 7:05:51| who have already died in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25551)|
| 7:05:54| This ordinance isn't looking after our public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25554)|
| 7:05:57| It's a distraction and it is dividing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25557)|
| 7:06:00| The Board of Health is here to protect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25560)|
| 7:06:03| It's here to make this place safe and to live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25563)|
| 7:06:07| and that has got to be our primary goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25567)|
| 7:06:10| Our healthcare systems are overrun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25570)|
| 7:06:12| and the state health director says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25572)|
| 7:06:13| if we continue on this path by January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25573)|
| 7:06:15| it will be completely broken for everyone in every way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25575)|
| 7:06:19| not just for people with COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25579)|
| 7:06:21| That means if you have a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25581)|
| 7:06:23| if you get in a car accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25583)|
| 7:06:24| if you have an allergic reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25584)|
| 7:06:27| if you have something that you need emergency services for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25587)|
| 7:06:31| you are a real risk of not being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25591)|
| 7:06:34| to have that emergency service at your fingertips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25594)|
| 7:06:37| Reports of ambulances delays are real and growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25597)|
| 7:06:41| Came out two days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25601)|
| 7:06:42| I talked to our ambulance company today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25602)|
| 7:06:44| and they are suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25604)|
| 7:06:46| Our healthcare workers and first line responders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25606)|
| 7:06:48| are getting sick and unable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25608)|
| 7:06:51| they will soon be unable to meet the demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25611)|
| 7:06:54| I have seen firsthand how this virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25614)|
| 7:06:56| is killing our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25616)|
| 7:06:57| and for every new person getting sick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25617)|
| 7:07:01| it means another person out of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25621)|
| 7:07:02| and another family in quarantine until they recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25622)|
| 7:07:06| and that is a real economic hit to every single person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25626)|
| 7:07:09| and it is driving us into a mental health state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25629)|
| 7:07:13| because of the spread and the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25633)|
| 7:07:15| and the spread and the sickness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25635)|
| 7:07:17| We aren't the worst in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25637)|
| 7:07:19| because our county is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25639)|
| 7:07:20| We're the worst in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25640)|
| 7:07:22| because we're fighting each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25642)|
| 7:07:23| instead of fighting this virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25643)|
| 7:07:25| and we never did this when we saw a wildfire coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25645)|
| 7:07:29| but yet we're sitting here today doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25649)|
| 7:07:31| Make no mistake about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25651)|
| 7:07:32| If this ordinance passes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25652)|
| 7:07:34| you will be dissolving the Board of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25654)|
| 7:07:37| and placing all the decision-making power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25657)|
| 7:07:39| in the hands of one person, our health director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25659)|
| 7:07:42| Now you may have confidence in her today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25662)|
| 7:07:44| but what if it's somebody different tomorrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25664)|
| 7:07:48| The unbelievable pressure you're about to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25668)|
| 7:07:50| on Dr. Buchanan who you all say you care for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25670)|
| 7:07:53| and you support is going to be unimaginable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25673)|
| 7:07:57| and it cannot be underestimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25677)|
| 7:08:00| Her ability to make sound decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25680)|
| 7:08:01| will be under constant pressure from everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25681)|
| 7:08:04| including her boss and yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25684)|
| 7:08:07| she can be unilaterally fired without cause by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25687)|
| 7:08:12| I have verified that from our former Knox County HR director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25692)|
| 7:08:15| who also happens to be the former director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25695)|
| 7:08:18| of the health department prior to Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25698)|
| 7:08:22| Frankly, beyond just getting fired, I fear for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25702)|
| 7:08:26| I fear for her staff's personal safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25706)|
| 7:08:28| and for her personal safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25708)|
| 7:08:30| something I've never thought imaginable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25710)|
| 7:08:32| Today, there are literally people posting people's names| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25712)|
| 7:08:36| and addresses and saying, let us go to their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25716)|
| 7:08:40| That is where we are as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25720)|
| 7:08:41| and that is why we are losing this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25721)|
| 7:08:45| There is a worthy discussion to have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25725)|
| 7:08:48| to examine constitutional powers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25728)|
| 7:08:50| Boy, we have ample time to review this down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25730)|
| 7:08:54| We will have ample time to look at how did we react to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25734)|
| 7:08:57| but I agree with Commissioner Hill and Dr. Buchanan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25737)|
| 7:09:01| the time is not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25741)|
| 7:09:03| If we proceed with this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25743)|
| 7:09:05| this body will undermine our public health infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25745)|
| 7:09:08| and seriously demoralize the healthcare professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25748)|
| 7:09:11| battling to save lives every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25751)|
| 7:09:12| You heard it directly from the healthcare professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25752)|
| 7:09:14| here in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25754)|
| 7:09:16| They're exhausted and they don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25756)|
| 7:09:19| why you don't care about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25759)|
| 7:09:21| And this is what it says to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25761)|
| 7:09:22| when we do things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25762)|
| 7:09:24| And just in case you don't think this decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25764)|
| 7:09:27| will impact business leaders in our region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25767)|
| 7:09:29| let me write the national headline for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25769)|
| 7:09:32| It will read, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25772)|
| 7:09:33| local government moves to gut their public health system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25773)|
| 7:09:36| as COVID numbers soar to highest in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25776)|
| 7:09:39| And if you don't think that influences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25779)|
| 7:09:41| a company's decision to come to Knox County, think again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25781)|
| 7:09:46| All I ask you is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25786)|
| 7:09:48| just please don't make this decision now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25788)|
| 7:09:51| Let's get healthy first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25791)|
| 7:09:52| We have a vaccine right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25792)|
| 7:09:55| We have holidays where people will literally die| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25795)|
| 7:09:59| every single day unless we get on a new path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25799)|
| 7:10:04| Then let's examine how we got here down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25804)|
| 7:10:06| Let's have those debates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25806)|
| 7:10:08| Let's talk about the constitutionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25808)|
| 7:10:09| Let's talk to our state officials, but not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25809)|
| 7:10:14| With that, I offer a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25814)|
| 7:10:17| to delay the consideration of this ordinance for 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25817)|
| 7:10:21| which will get us past the spring when we have a vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25821)|
| 7:10:24| and we will be in a much healthier place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25824)|
| 7:10:26| both mentally and physically as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25826)|
| 7:10:29| And I ask your support for a second and its passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25829)|
| 7:10:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25832)|
| 7:10:34| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25834)|
| 7:10:44| So the substitute motion to delay this ordinance decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25844)|
| 7:10:50| on first reading for 120 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25850)|
| 7:10:52| first by Commissioner Jay, second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25852)|
| 7:10:56| Additional discussion, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25856)|
| 7:10:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25859)|
| 7:11:04| Law Director Buke doesn't have a raise your hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25864)|
| 7:11:06| so he would like to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25866)|
| 7:11:12| Director Buke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25872)|
| 7:11:15| I feel constrained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25875)|
| 7:11:16| I'm not taking a position on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25876)|
| 7:11:19| but I feel constrained to respond to some statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25879)|
| 7:11:22| you made, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25882)|
| 7:11:25| and then also your substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25885)|
| 7:11:28| And I don't know whether under Robert's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25888)|
| 7:11:30| which if your motion is to delay this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25890)|
| 7:11:35| until a time certain or exactly what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25895)|
| 7:11:40| because it needs to have some sort of meaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25900)|
| 7:11:43| to go with Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25903)|
| 7:11:44| But more importantly, to say that this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25904)|
| 7:11:48| was not legal strains my legal mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25908)|
| 7:11:54| And I don't know where you come from in your legal analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25914)|
| 7:11:59| by referring to what the commissioner can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25919)|
| 7:12:02| to a county that doesn't have a board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25922)|
| 7:12:05| by creating one does not say in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25925)|
| 7:12:10| that this commission does not have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25930)|
| 7:12:14| to create an advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25934)|
| 7:12:16| Nowhere is that anywhere in the law that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25936)|
| 7:12:21| And to say that is I think to mislead the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25941)|
| 7:12:26| and this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25946)|
| 7:12:27| Now, I don't care how you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25947)|
| 7:12:29| but I think that's misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25949)|
| 7:12:31| The other thing is that we must remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25951)|
| 7:12:34| that what the governor said was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25954)|
| 7:12:37| that the local health departments in these six counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25957)|
| 7:12:40| are going to be in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25960)|
| 7:12:41| It doesn't say the boards of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25961)|
| 7:12:44| The governor didn't say anything about a board of health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25964)|
| 7:12:46| He said, the health department i.e. that's Dr. Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25966)|
| 7:12:53| is charged with making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25973)|
| 7:12:55| So that's what the governor said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25975)|
| 7:12:58| He had nothing to do with the board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25978)|
| 7:13:01| and the other counties don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25981)|
| 7:13:02| In fact, I think I pointed out at the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25982)|
| 7:13:06| that Shelby County had created a board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25986)|
| 7:13:10| as advisory only using the same language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25990)|
| 7:13:16| that was in the one creating a board of health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25996)|
| 7:13:19| that has this autonomous power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=25999)|
| 7:13:21| So I just need to make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26001)|
| 7:13:22| and with regard to your substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26002)|
| 7:13:26| it probably needs some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26006)|
| 7:13:29| The substitute motion is to delay this ordinance vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26009)|
| 7:13:36| on first reading for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26016)|
| 7:13:39| So this would move it 36 and I would move it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26019)|
| 7:13:43| to the May commission meeting on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26023)|
| 7:13:48| The motion to comply with Robert's Rules of Order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26028)|
| 7:13:51| must go home to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26031)|
| 7:13:56| That's Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26036)|
| 7:13:58| So that's the proper wording is all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26038)|
| 7:14:05| Duly noted and the amendment would be made to reflect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26045)|
| 7:14:11| Motion to delay this to a time certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26051)|
| 7:14:14| at a minimum of 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26054)|
| 7:14:21| Is there additional discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26061)|
| 7:14:32| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26072)|
| 7:14:36| This is a vote on the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26076)|
| 7:14:39| to delay the vote on this ordinance at first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26079)|
| 7:14:45| to a time certain at a minimum of 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26085)|
| 7:14:50| No sooner than 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26090)|
| 7:14:57| Is that clear to everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26097)|
| 7:14:58| If you vote yes, it is delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26098)|
| 7:15:00| If you vote no, we will go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26100)|
| 7:15:05| Once again, the proper word under Robert's Rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26105)|
| 7:15:08| is postpone, not delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26108)|
| 7:15:11| Postpone to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26111)|
| 7:15:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26116)|
| 7:15:17| Madam Clerk, please call the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26117)|
| 7:15:20| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26120)|

| 7:16:24| Substitute motion fails six to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26184)|
| 7:16:27| We'll now return back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26187)|
| 7:16:29| Six to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26189)|
| 7:16:30| Excuse me, six to four, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26190)|
| 7:16:31| Six no, four ayes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26191)|
| 7:16:36| But doesn't the pass go with the losing side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26196)|
| 7:16:40| No, he said he remains a pass, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26200)|
| 7:16:42| Okay, I thought it turns into a no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26202)|
| 7:16:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26207)|
| 7:16:49| So the substitute motion fails six, four, and one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26209)|
| 7:16:54| Six, four, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26214)|
| 7:16:56| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26216)|
| 7:16:57| Commissioner Smith, you have your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26217)|
| 7:17:00| Yes, sir, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26220)|

| 7:17:06| and I would like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26226)|
| 7:17:09| My substitute motion is that we approve first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26229)|
| 7:17:14| and then postpone to a certain day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26234)|
| 7:17:17| of 90 days later for our second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26237)|
| 7:17:21| And if the law department wants me to look up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26241)|
| 7:17:23| what that date of that meeting will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26243)|
| 7:17:25| I'll be happy to do that if you'll give me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26245)|
| 7:17:29| So the substitute motion is to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26249)|
| 7:17:34| but at the same time delay the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26254)|
| 7:17:37| for 90 days thereafter, which would be January, February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26257)|
| 7:17:41| it would be our March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26261)|
| 7:17:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26267)|
| 7:17:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26270)|
| 7:17:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26271)|

| 7:18:01| with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26281)|
| 7:18:03| The substitute motion is to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26283)|
| 7:18:09| to approve this on first reading tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26289)|
| 7:18:11| and then delay the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26291)|
| 7:18:14| until the March 2021 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26294)|

| 7:20:04| Commissioner Bussler, and Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26404)|

| 7:20:10| from a pass to a yes or a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26410)|
| 7:20:14| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26414)|
| 7:20:16| I had a question about your substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26416)|
| 7:20:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26421)|
| 7:20:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26427)|
| 7:20:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26431)|
| 7:20:32| Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26432)|
| 7:20:33| So you stated earlier, whenever you were speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26433)|
| 7:20:38| that one of the things that you had a tough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26438)|
| 7:20:43| basically digesting was the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26443)|
| 7:20:45| that the Board of Health spoke about reaching out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26445)|
| 7:20:49| into other counties that surrounded us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26449)|
| 7:20:51| as well as suggested things to the governor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26451)|
| 7:20:53| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26453)|
| 7:20:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26457)|
| 7:20:59| So if this passes, what's to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26459)|
| 7:21:04| that that doesn't happen again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26464)|
| 7:21:05| and then we're locked into a 90-day hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26465)|
| 7:21:07| and there's nothing we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26467)|
| 7:21:16| I have some questions about reconstituting the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26476)|
| 7:21:21| as Commissioner Durrett has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26481)|
| 7:21:25| I have some questions that I still have unanswered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26485)|
| 7:21:31| I am trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26491)|
| 7:21:35| lack of a more articulate way to say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26495)|
| 7:21:38| is take some action and pause and wait and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26498)|
| 7:21:46| I guess that's the best explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26506)|
| 7:21:47| I can give you, Commissioner Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26507)|
| 7:21:49| is I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26509)|
| 7:21:55| I'm just thinking, if something tells me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26515)|
| 7:21:56| that's the best thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26516)|
| 7:22:01| When is our next scheduled meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26521)|
| 7:22:06| January 4th, week and 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26526)|
| 7:22:10| And I'm trying to wrap my mind around the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26530)|
| 7:22:18| that we're doing those specific things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26538)|
| 7:22:19| because I do like how your resolution is structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26539)|
| 7:22:22| about passing this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26542)|
| 7:22:24| but I'm trying to myself figure out the specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26544)|
| 7:22:30| because like you stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26550)|
| 7:22:31| you feel like the Board of Health throttled back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26551)|
| 7:22:34| because of the concern that they've seen from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26554)|
| 7:22:36| but I'm just trying to wrap my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26556)|
| 7:22:38| around everything as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26558)|
| 7:22:40| and from a logical standpoint, does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26560)|
| 7:22:45| No, I would assume according to Robert's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26565)|
| 7:22:49| and our own commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26569)|
| 7:22:51| that if eight of us decided next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26571)|
| 7:22:56| to put it on the agenda, it could be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26576)|
| 7:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26578)|
| 7:23:07| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26587)|
| 7:23:11| That's a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26591)|
| 7:23:12| The answer is yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26592)|
| 7:23:20| Commissioner Biggs, would you like to change your vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26600)|
| 7:23:22| from a pass to a yes or a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26602)|
| 7:23:26| I'd like to hear from Commissioner Beeler and Bussler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26606)|
| 7:23:29| if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26609)|
| 7:23:32| Commissioner Beeler has already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26612)|
| 7:23:34| Commissioner Bussler, would you like to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26614)|
| 7:23:36| from a pass to a yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26616)|
| 7:23:39| Let me ask a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26619)|
| 7:23:41| Does this have to be passed on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26621)|
| 7:23:45| by two-thirds or just a simple majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26625)|
| 7:23:47| Simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26627)|
| 7:23:52| Simple majority has been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26632)|
| 7:23:56| Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26636)|
| 7:23:57| would you like to change your pass to a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26637)|
| 7:23:59| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26639)|
| 7:24:02| Mr. Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26642)|
| 7:24:04| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26644)|
| 7:24:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26647)|
| 7:24:09| Is that a no vote or you would like to remain as pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26649)|
| 7:24:12| As pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26652)|
| 7:24:13| You're going to remain as pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26653)|
| 7:24:16| Mr. Biggs or Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26656)|
| 7:24:20| I'll stay pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26660)|
| 7:24:22| Mr. Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26662)|
| 7:24:26| I'll stay pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26666)|
| 7:24:28| Would anybody else like to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26668)|
| 7:24:33| Please speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26673)|
| 7:24:35| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26675)|
| 7:24:41| I change to a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26681)|
| 7:24:44| Mr. Quick, Commissioner Durrett changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26684)|
| 7:24:46| from a no to a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26686)|
| 7:24:48| Is there-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26688)|
| 7:24:49| And to explain why I'm changing my vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26689)|
| 7:24:52| is to have this time to, like Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26692)|
| 7:24:57| to review some things and to go over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26697)|
| 7:25:01| I mean, I can't in good conscience vote yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26701)|
| 7:25:05| to this passing on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26705)|
| 7:25:09| but I can if I get this extra time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26709)|
| 7:25:14| to really work on the nuts and bolts of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26714)|
| 7:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26718)|
| 7:25:20| So I want to verify what votes are on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26720)|
| 7:25:24| before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26724)|
| 7:25:25| I have Commissioner Biggs, Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26725)|
| 7:25:28| Schoonmaker, and Bussler all as passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26728)|
| 7:25:30| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26730)|
| 7:25:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26732)|

| 7:25:39| Commissioners Lundy, Baylor, and Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26739)|
| 7:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26743)|

| 7:25:54| Okay, does anybody else wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26754)|
| 7:25:58| Last call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26758)|
| 7:26:05| Okay, Madam Clerk, announce the vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26765)|
| 7:26:09| Four aye votes, three no votes, four passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26769)|
| 7:26:15| Substitute motion by Commissioner Smith does not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26775)|
| 7:26:19| We are now back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26779)|
| 7:26:22| The original motion was by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26782)|
| 7:26:28| to approve with a second by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26788)|
| 7:26:31| Additional discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26791)|
| 7:26:33| Lots of hands are up, so please, if your hand's up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26793)|
| 7:26:36| I'm going to call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26796)|
| 7:26:37| If not, take your hand down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26797)|
| 7:26:40| Is there any additional discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26800)|
| 7:26:43| before we go to this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26803)|
| 7:26:46| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26806)|
| 7:26:48| Thank you, thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26808)|
| 7:26:51| Just before you vote, several of you have voiced support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26811)|
| 7:26:57| for me, and I appreciate that, appreciate that confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26817)|
| 7:27:03| And what I would ask you is, regardless of how you vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26823)|
| 7:27:08| to really, really support the Five Core Actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26828)|
| 7:27:12| and come together as leaders and lead, step up and lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26832)|
| 7:27:17| That's what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26837)|
| 7:27:18| You asked what would bring our community together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26838)|
| 7:27:20| and that's you leading and stepping up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26840)|
| 7:27:23| and not just verbally saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26843)|
| 7:27:25| you support the Five Core Actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26845)|
| 7:27:26| but showing and demonstrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26846)|
| 7:27:28| you support the Five Core Actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26848)|
| 7:27:29| actually having a virtual meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26849)|
| 7:27:31| not having a virtual meeting where some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26851)|
| 7:27:33| are in the same place, but actually having a virtual meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26853)|
| 7:27:38| and wearing your mask and posting on social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26858)|
| 7:27:42| the things that people need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26862)|
| 7:27:43| and modeling that behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26863)|
| 7:27:45| We've got to come together as leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26865)|
| 7:27:48| if we hope our community's going to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26868)|
| 7:27:52| and fight this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26872)|
| 7:27:54| We will not win this battle separately and divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26874)|
| 7:27:58| And if we continue to divide our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26878)|
| 7:28:00| COVID doesn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26880)|
| 7:28:02| COVID continues to do its thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26882)|
| 7:28:04| If we step up and lead, if you step up and lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26884)|
| 7:28:08| and demonstrate and do the things that you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26888)|
| 7:28:11| and show that you support the Five Core Actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26891)|
| 7:28:14| people will follow you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26894)|
| 7:28:15| You are leaders, you were elected, people trust you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26895)|
| 7:28:19| Please do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26899)|
| 7:28:20| And it doesn't matter how you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26900)|
| 7:28:23| Please do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26903)|
| 7:28:25| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26905)|
| 7:28:27| Commissioner Ward, is there a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26907)|
| 7:28:29| with the law director you'd like to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26909)|
| 7:28:32| I was just asking what I'm allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26912)|
| 7:28:33| and not allowed to do in terms of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26913)|
| 7:28:38| if I'm allowed to make a substitute motion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26918)|
| 7:28:41| You are the original maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26921)|
| 7:28:45| So you may amend your own motion before we take a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26925)|
| 7:28:48| if you would like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26928)|
| 7:28:51| You don't have to do a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26931)|
| 7:28:52| because you made the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26932)|
| 7:28:53| and as long as your second agrees, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26933)|
| 7:28:56| I would say let's have the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26936)|
| 7:29:05| on the 25th of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26945)|
| 7:29:07| giving us a full month to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26947)|
| 7:29:11| That's what we would do if it was passed tonight anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26951)|
| 7:29:14| It wouldn't be read on the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26954)|
| 7:29:17| No, it would be voted on, we would read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26957)|
| 7:29:21| we would talk about it on the 19th actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26961)|
| 7:29:23| because 18th is a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26963)|
| 7:29:26| So we would just talk about it in our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26966)|
| 7:29:27| but we would not vote on it again until the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26967)|
| 7:29:31| Okay, so it wouldn't be voted on until the 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26971)|
| 7:29:33| Yeah, that's our next County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26973)|
| 7:29:36| Okay, so it won't be able to be done in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26976)|
| 7:29:39| So it gives us a month to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26979)|
| 7:29:42| At that point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26982)|
| 7:29:42| if we decide to vote to postpone it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26982)|
| 7:29:45| we can decide to vote to postpone it a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26985)|
| 7:29:48| We could do that in January, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26988)|
| 7:29:51| Okay, so we have a month to see what evolves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26991)|
| 7:29:54| over the next four to five weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26994)|
| 7:29:58| So would you like to stay with the original motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=26998)|
| 7:30:00| to approve this on first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27000)|
| 7:30:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27002)|
| 7:30:04| Commissioner Daly, you would like to second that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27004)|
| 7:30:06| No, I need to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27006)|
| 7:30:09| Tabling is not what we discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27009)|
| 7:30:11| it was postponing it to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27011)|
| 7:30:14| Tabling is a totally different thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27014)|
| 7:30:17| and it would ultimately destroy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27017)|
| 7:30:20| I want to vote it on first reading tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27020)|
| 7:30:25| And then the motion that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27025)|
| 7:30:28| is still to approve this ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27028)|
| 7:30:32| That's what you're asking to stick with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27032)|
| 7:30:35| Not changing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27035)|
| 7:30:37| Correct, and Commissioner Daly, you are seconding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27037)|
| 7:30:40| There's nothing changed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27040)|
| 7:30:42| There's no need for a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27042)|
| 7:30:45| I know, I just want to verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27045)|
| 7:30:46| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27046)|
| 7:30:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27047)|
| 7:30:49| If I think I'm hearing this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27049)|
| 7:30:52| I'm even hearing the proposer of the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27052)|
| 7:31:02| having himself even doubts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27062)|
| 7:31:07| I don't, I'm just trying to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27067)|
| 7:31:09| where we stand on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27069)|
| 7:31:12| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27072)|
| 7:31:15| Is there any additional discussion before we take the vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27075)|
| 7:31:18| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27078)|
| 7:31:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27081)|
| 7:31:23| Dr. B, as I stated last week, I will support you 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27083)|
| 7:31:28| I may not agree with your decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27088)|
| 7:31:30| but I'm telling you tonight, I will support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27090)|
| 7:31:34| I will support your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27094)|
| 7:31:36| I will tell the people in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27096)|
| 7:31:39| that gives me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27099)|
| 7:31:40| No, I am supporting Dr. B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27100)|
| 7:31:42| So if Dr. B wants to extend the face mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27102)|
| 7:31:46| till June 30th of 2021, I support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27106)|
| 7:31:51| Dr. B wants to keep the bars and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27111)|
| 7:31:54| closed to 10 o'clock, I'll support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27114)|
| 7:31:57| And if we need to do a resolution next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27117)|
| 7:32:01| that this 11 member body supports you 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27121)|
| 7:32:05| I'll co-sponsor it, I'll sponsor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27125)|
| 7:32:08| I'm telling you, I will support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27128)|
| 7:32:09| And I believe that if we want to come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27129)|
| 7:32:15| the way to come together is get behind Dr. B 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27135)|
| 7:32:19| And that's how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27139)|
| 7:32:23| I see hands up from Commissioner Durrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27143)|
| 7:32:25| Commissioner Bustler, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27145)|
| 7:32:28| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27148)|
| 7:32:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27150)|
| 7:32:33| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27153)|
| 7:32:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27154)|
| 7:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27155)|
| 7:32:36| I've had, aside from the governmental aspect of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27156)|
| 7:32:39| I had stuff prepared and I'm not even like my breath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27159)|
| 7:32:44| is gone to say all these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27164)|
| 7:32:48| but basically going, you know, Christmas is in four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27168)|
| 7:32:54| And in this time, you know, it's a peace of goodwill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27174)|
| 7:32:58| or it's a time of peace and goodwill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27178)|
| 7:32:59| among and between us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27179)|
| 7:33:01| And, you know, putting those things aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27181)|
| 7:33:03| that hadn't written down and putting the things aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27183)|
| 7:33:06| that I had referencing how or what Jesus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27186)|
| 7:33:12| if he were here sitting in on our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27192)|
| 7:33:15| what would he be thinking or what would his message be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27195)|
| 7:33:19| And I think we're missing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27199)|
| 7:33:21| And so with that, I would like to just reiterate something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27201)|
| 7:33:26| that one of the speakers in public forum stated earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27206)|
| 7:33:29| I believe her name was Emily Roberts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27209)|
| 7:33:32| and that it is not the time to renovate the sprinkler system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27212)|
| 7:33:36| when the building is on fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27216)|
| 7:33:38| Our board of health is our sprinkler system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27218)|
| 7:33:41| and is here to protect the public health of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27221)|
| 7:33:45| and minimize the impact of COVID on our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27225)|
| 7:33:48| Knox County is on fire and we need its protection now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27228)|
| 7:33:53| not tomorrow, not next month when this is on second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27233)|
| 7:33:59| and we can see where we go from now, it's Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27239)|
| 7:34:03| We've seen what Thanksgiving has done to COVID numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27243)|
| 7:34:07| and it's gonna get worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27247)|
| 7:34:10| So we're on fire now and we should not revamp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27250)|
| 7:34:15| our sprinkler system at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27255)|
| 7:34:20| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27260)|
| 7:34:21| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27261)|
| 7:34:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27264)|
| 7:34:26| I think Mr. Baylor said something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27266)|
| 7:34:28| that we should have listened to a little bit closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27268)|
| 7:34:33| I was talking about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27273)|
| 7:34:34| when you lose confidence in somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27274)|
| 7:34:36| you don't follow their suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27276)|
| 7:34:41| There's a lot of people that have lost their confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27281)|
| 7:34:43| in the board, but you need one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27283)|
| 7:34:49| to lead us through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27289)|
| 7:34:52| One person, not a bunch of boards, but one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27292)|
| 7:34:55| In any great time of need, there's always one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27295)|
| 7:35:00| that comes out and leads us out of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27300)|
| 7:35:06| And we're saying right now, we believe we need one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27306)|
| 7:35:11| and we're talking to that one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27311)|
| 7:35:14| So, you know, you can't lead by a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27314)|
| 7:35:20| Just that one leader is what we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27320)|
| 7:35:23| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27323)|
| 7:35:24| I just thought I'd let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27324)|
| 7:35:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27327)|
| 7:35:28| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27328)|
| 7:35:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27331)|
| 7:35:33| And I want to kind of address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27333)|
| 7:35:35| what Commissioner Bussler just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27335)|
| 7:35:38| We put this all in the hands of Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27338)|
| 7:35:41| And God bless you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27341)|
| 7:35:44| I don't want to jinx you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27344)|
| 7:35:46| but what if something happens to Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27346)|
| 7:35:49| What if she says she's had enough of this and she quits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27349)|
| 7:35:53| Or something worse happens to her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27353)|
| 7:35:56| Then whose hands are we going to put it in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27356)|
| 7:35:58| It'll be somebody we don't know and we might not trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27358)|
| 7:36:02| Could you imagine being out right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27362)|
| 7:36:03| trying to hire a health director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27363)|
| 7:36:07| So I'm going to offer another substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27367)|
| 7:36:10| Just straight up substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27370)|
| 7:36:12| that we defer this 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27372)|
| 7:36:18| So there's a substitute motion on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27378)|
| 7:36:21| to defer for 30 days on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27381)|
| 7:36:24| So that means first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27384)|
| 7:36:25| would move to our January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27385)|
| 7:36:27| Is there a second for this motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27387)|
| 7:36:30| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27390)|
| 7:36:32| I second by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27392)|
| 7:36:33| first by Commissioner Smith to defer to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27393)|
| 7:36:40| Give me the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27400)|
| 7:36:43| I would like to defer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-201221?start=27403)|
