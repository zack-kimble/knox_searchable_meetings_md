| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| Our meeting will be a little different than last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| Last week we had some presentations, important presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| particularly related to the data that was collected via the surveys and the focus groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=37)|
| 0:00:45| You may recall, those of you who were here last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| that a whole series of questions were asked by members of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| and the staff from the school system was taking notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=54)|
| 0:00:59| and has compiled a list of questions that were asked last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| My hope for this evening is that we can spend the first half of the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=64)|
| 0:01:08| going through the questions that were formulated last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=68)|
| 0:01:11| then to ask if there are additional questions that came out of your review of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=71)|
| 0:01:17| We all agreed after last meeting that we would take that data home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| take a hard look at it, and see if there were any additional questions that came to the fore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| I expect that there will be new questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=85)|
| 0:01:28| I think in fairness to our colleagues on the school administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| there may be questions that we just don't know the answers to tonight but can be researched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| and I think it's fair for them to just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| we don't know the answer to that but we'll get back with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| I'm eager to make sure that the questions get asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=104)|
| 0:01:47| with that understanding that nobody can anticipate all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| Having said that, when we finally feel like we've gotten the questions out that we need to get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=114)|
| 0:01:59| I would like for us to spend some time shaping what the message is that we'd like to give to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| You'll recall last week that when the chair of the Board of Education spoke with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| she said, we're not asking you for specific recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| That's right, we're asking you to react to the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Based on our experience as citizens and our experiences with the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| to make sure that we help the school board understand our perspectives and our reactions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=144)|
| 0:02:32| our responses to the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=152)|
| 0:02:34| I think all of us are eager to make sure that a whole host of questions are asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| I must say, I think it's become very clear that we don't have too many questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=160)|
| 0:02:48| that the school administration hasn't started thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| They've been working on this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| I think hearing the questions helps them to shape what their priorities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| in terms of getting information out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| This is what the public wants to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| Each of us is representing a constituency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| and it's important for us to let the administration know what matters most to the people we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| With that having said, what we have is a list of questions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| and the person who asked them and the person who's on the staff who will answer the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| Why don't we start with the questions that came up last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Reverend Brown is not here, so I'm going to skip his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| I hope he'll be here with us in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=214)|
| 0:03:38| Dr. Grimm asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| what are our plans to gather additional reopening information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| and concerns from individuals that are medically fragile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| I think that Jason will be here to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| Jason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| Yes, sir. I'm right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| Why don't you start by telling us who you are, what your role in the school administration is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| and if you can come up where we can see you, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Yes, sir. I'm Jason Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| I'm the Executive Director of Student Supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| Essentially, I oversee all of our programming for special populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=247)|
| 0:04:13| which would include, obviously, our medically fragile children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| As we've sent out the survey and started to collect data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| we really wanted to start getting an idea of what sort of numbers might we be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=261)|
| 0:04:26| in terms of when school starts of families who maybe wouldn't be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| sending their students back to us, regardless of what our plans were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| Certainly, I would suspect that some of those folks are the parents of our medically fragile children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=275)|
| 0:04:42| Essentially, as we transition in, what we're really going to be working hard to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| is have individual conversations with those families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| so that we can design a plan that fits those children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Those children are all different, and they all have individual needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| and it's the job of my department to ensure that those individual needs are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| We're not really looking at a big blanket communication for those families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| as much as we are making those individual contacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| utilizing our case managers and our supervisory staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| so, again, that we can create a plan that is individual to the needs of those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| Very good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| The next question is from Mr. Hundley, and the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| what is the equitable plan for uninterrupted teaching and learning if school closes unexpectedly again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| And I would add that the governor has extended this particular phase of the reopening plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| so that may have some impact given our hope to be able to open by August 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| So, John Reis is going to answer that question for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=350)|
| 0:05:59| Dr. Askew, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| When did you say the governor extended? I wasn't certain about what that meant, what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| The current phase of reopening has been extended to August 29th. Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| So, if you have any specifics, I'm sure you all thought about what impact that would have on what your hopes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| It just happened this afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Thank you. Mr. Reis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| All right. Thank you, John Reis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| I'm the chief academic officer for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| Sorry I wasn't here last week, but it's great to see you guys now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| So, a question about how will we basically not do what we did last spring, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| run into a situation where we're teaching and then all of a sudden we come to an abrupt stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| and had to end up doing a review because we didn't have the capabilities not to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| One, our board and superintendent had approval for the one-to-one devices, so those will be deployed to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| So, that was the first hurdle that we had was not having the devices for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| no guarantee they had those in every home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| So, we have that now and we'll be deploying those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| And then also, our team has done a really good job, I can say this because I have nothing to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| but our team has done a really good job with putting together training for teachers for the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| I think it's important to note, too, on how to teach effectively online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| It's important to note, too, that this has been a process we've been doing for seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| So, a lot of our schools have become one-to-one schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| We had a one-to-one initiative about seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| So, we're not new to this process or new to effective teaching through using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| The problem was we didn't have that equitably across the whole district as far as devices and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| So, we spent the summer training for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| We'll continue to do that, continue to have support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| We have a department that does educational technology just for those supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| and does training for staff as well and has done that for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| So, what will happen is we'll begin this year and we have teachers understanding they should be using those resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| even if we're live in class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| They should still be using things like Canvas, learning management systems, Microsoft Teams, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=479)|
| 0:08:05| It can be part of your class, even if you're not fully online, even if you're in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| So then, if something were to happen that we would have an abrupt stop to move over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| kids would have some familiarity with receiving instruction, submitting instruction that way, and doing those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| Mr. Reisel, the superintendent mentioned this last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| but we have significant swaths of territory in the county where students don't have access to Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| What you just described is awesome if you have access to Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| How are we trying to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| I may have Gail Beyer jump in on that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| So, we mentioned Hurdle 1 was the device, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| We have the devices now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Hurdle 2 is guaranteeing or trying our best to get the Internet accessibility for all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| That is a little more difficult, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| I mean, there are some places where socioeconomics play a factor in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| There are some places where just being in a rural part of the county plays a factor in the quality of that that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| So, really, the school can't solve that one on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| And I'm going to turn it over to Gail to kind of speak through a couple of task forces that have been working on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| as well as some plans we might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| Thank you, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| I'm Gail Beyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| I'm the chief technology officer for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| There's several things going on, and we have been blessed in the district to have been engaged by several community partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=569)|
| 0:09:39| The one that is really addressing the issue that you've spoken about is led by the Knoxville Chamber Partnership under Amy Nolan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=579)|
| 0:09:48| who is vice president, I believe, for regional enhancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| Amy has formed a very robust committee of partnerships in the community, both city and county officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=591)|
| 0:10:01| as well as telecom partners and some business leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| And we're having regular meetings to discuss how that can be reinforced from our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=606)|
| 0:10:12| things such as they're developing flyers to give information out to our families that can tell them where they can get discounted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=612)|
| 0:10:21| Internet access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| They're looking at setting up a helpline for parents that they can call that would be manned by groups outside the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=623)|
| 0:10:32| that would help parents with those initiatives of getting Internet access at their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| There's a lot of discounted wired options that are out there with our Internet service providers in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=637)|
| 0:10:46| and some of our families are just not aware of that or they may need assistance applying for those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| So that's one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| Secondly, they're doing a major fundraising campaign, which is, as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| very much a relief to us in our stretched budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| So they're going to be looking at ways that they can help families, especially those in socioeconomic need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=665)|
| 0:11:12| They're also going to be looking at options for wireless, as Dr. Roswick mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| in areas where the wired option is just not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| They're looking at some other technologies, which they're going to test in some communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| that might be able to be addressed with some wireless capabilities sort of in mass in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| So I feel really good about this initiative, and I'm very, very grateful for this community outreach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=694)|
| 0:11:42| and they're making very good progress in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Keep in mind that we understand that this is a very big challenge for many of our community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| and many of our families, and we hope to get this information out very quickly prior to the start of the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=711)|
| 0:11:59| so that we can have those services for our students before we start school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| Yes, Mr. Stanley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| What percentage of the Knox County students have some sort of connectivity now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=728)|
| 0:12:15| I heard a number last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| I was thinking it was like 92, but I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| What percentage have connectivity at this point so we kind of know what we're dealing with in terms of connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| because whatever form of connectivity you use, we're going to have to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Before we can utilize the one-to-one, and so I think that's huge between now and August 10th or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=755)|
| 0:12:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Thank you for the question, Mr. Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| We did do a focus survey across our nine board districts or nine regions in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| We came up with a survey response rate that told us that approximately 92% across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| so the county as a whole, of our respondents had Internet connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Now, our research and evaluation department tells us that's a plus or minus 5% margin of error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| So we erred on the side of worst-case scenario when we talked about budget numbers for our chamber partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=792)|
| 0:13:21| We also know that we have two particular areas, maybe three in the county, the inner city area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=801)|
| 0:13:29| the south area, and the east area, that for various reasons, a lot of them geographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| and some of them economic, are not as well served as the other areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| Have you approached the providers yet to see if there may be some subsidized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=819)|
| 0:13:47| or comp services for those who may not be able to afford the access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| I know you talked about the chamber, but what about the providers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| They're going to step up and help, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| Yes, and they have been excellent, I will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| All of our Internet service providers, as well as our wireless carriers, have been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Each of the Internet service providers has a discounted plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| which amounts to roughly $10 a month for families that qualify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| So that's sort of a first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| We're looking to see if families, when they indicate they don't have service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| what service is provided in your area at your residence, can you qualify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| and can we help you apply for that service, and then go from there if that step's not successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Mr. Gilmour, you had a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| Yes, I have just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| You said 92 percent, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=882)|
| 0:14:44| How does that relate to the question on page 16 of our original thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| that talked about reliable and consistent access to online services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| There's parents, there's 55 to 60 percent between parents and students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| I don't know, you said that was through a focus group, the 92 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Yes, the 92 percent was derived from choosing a random sampling out of each of the nine board districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=902)|
| 0:15:11| and then continuing to call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| We had customer service reps who actually made the phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| and continuing to call until we got a valid number in each of those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Mr. Chair, I have a subsequent question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| So you said 92 percent of your respondents to the survey, you determined, have connectivity, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| How many persons were actually surveyed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Can you give me that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| A little over 3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| 3,000, yeah, that's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| It was a little over 3,000 across all nine districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Okay, 3,000 across all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| Is that the representation from each district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| And Reverend Brown, the next questions we'll ask came from you, and these will be answered, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| the first one by, Jason, you're up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Sam works just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| Okay, thank you, Sam, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| Should all students and staff members, including custodians, food service workers, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| have temperatures checked daily prior to entering KCS facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| and have you guys thought about how you could make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| given the massive numbers we're talking about in some of our schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| Yeah, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Yeah, so, you know, we're very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| We have a great relationship with our health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| I work very closely with Charity Manafee as we are looking at these various plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| To directly address the temperature question, I think right now we would be planning to, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| check everyone's temperatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| The State Department of Ed has already supplied school districts with thermometers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| and I believe Russ's department has procured more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| So we're going to stock our schools with, I believe, a 40 to 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| so one thermometer for every 40 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| In terms of what is that going to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| it's going to look very different in every grade band,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| and it's going to look very different in every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| We're certainly going to make sure to work closely with our principals to help them as much as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| but ultimately that's going to be a plan that's going to be determined at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| We want to make sure that our folks have the autonomy to do what's best for their buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| their kids, and their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| You may be able to help on the next one, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| Ron is the lead answerer on this one, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Will KCS purchase school supplies for students that can't afford personal supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| I assume that means masks and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Another question from Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| I'm Ron McPherson, chief financial officer for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| The short answer to that is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Each year we, the district, send an allocation to every school based on their percentage of at-risk population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1075)|
| 0:18:03| and so we send those dollars to the schools for that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Now, this year in the budget we did cut those allocation dollars by 50% because of the budget constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| However, there's a million dollars in unspent funds that reside at the schools, cumulatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1095)|
| 0:18:23| Now, some schools may have more than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| So in those instances where schools begin to see that maybe they can't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1105)|
| 0:18:30| or they're running out of the money, so to speak, then yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| at that point we would work with the schools to ensure families, those that cannot pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1113)|
| 0:18:38| that they would be taken care of that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| I had kind of two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| One is I totally understand the budget constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| because you are under some pretty significant budget constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| but who generally is going to do the sanitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| Because I was thinking in terms of like special education, teachers or teaching assistants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| is there going to be some kind of broad role release for both cleaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| because we're not just talking about cleaning, you know, desks and handles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| We're also talking about materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| We're talking about door handles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| We're talking about special devices like ACC devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| Yeah, Jason, you know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| All of the special OTPT equipment would have to be wiped down regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| Now, you know, teachers and teaching assistants aren't going to have that kind of time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| And as it is now, the maintenance people can't get –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| I mean they have a lot on their hands cleaning just the rooms from a regular day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| Now we're looking at like deep cleaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| So I will talk about the special ed specific part of that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| and I'll defer to Russ Oakes on the larger scope of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| There's no doubt that that will pose a significant challenge, cleaning those materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1197)|
| 0:20:05| As of now, the plan would be obviously to work with that classroom staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| and really structure, you know, a sound cleaning protocol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| whether that is are we going to build that into the students' days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| are we going to build that into our peer tutors' responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| or are we going to have to utilize staff to clean the materials and have that strict protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| The CDC provides guidelines for those kinds of cleanings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| and there are guidelines to child care facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| So our goal would be to try to mimic that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Again, you know, there's no perfect answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| We all recognize that, you know, our teachers and our teaching assistants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| and all those things, we all recognize the work they do throughout the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| It's going to be a bit of a paradigm shift to try to structure that in such a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| to where we can get those materials cleaned, because you are correct, they will need sanitized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| I mean, I totally understand the budget constraints are massive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| especially given that we're going to need more staff and more materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| and teachers are already buying materials for their classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| And I'm just wondering if there's some way we could leverage some of the COVID money from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1274)|
| 0:21:23| or local to kind of help mitigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| Plus, I don't know if we would be on solid ground asking peer tutors to clean and sanitize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1286)|
| 0:21:34| So although, I mean, I think everybody in the whole school would be part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| but I would be a little concerned about that being a bigger part of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1298)|
| 0:21:46| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| We definitely need to mitigate the spread, and I think all the students in every school that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| are going to have to comply with certain guidelines, but I don't know if we can assume that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| Sure, and I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| I don't think the biggest part of the plan can be utilizing our peer tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| I guess the biggest point of this answer is we're going to have to get creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| and utilize what resources we have to battle a problem that we know is going to be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| We did receive some additional money through the IDEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| I don't know that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| It's not much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| I've already looked at the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| It's not as much as you thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| It's very little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| But, you know, it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| And so we're looking at creative ways to utilize that money currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| And so certainly if we feel like we could get some benefit from additional personnel or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1351)|
| 0:22:37| we would obviously consider that as well as materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| Mr. Hundley, you had a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Speaking of cleaning, UVC technology has been around for many, many, many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| and I believe several weeks ago a school board member, McMillan, sent a letter in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| I will admit I don't know a lot about the technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| I have read quite a bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| But have you all had a chance to look at that in terms of HVAC systems, in terms of purifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| I know the hospitals and the airlines are looking at that technology very, very heavily moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1388)|
| 0:23:24| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| I'm Russ Oakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I'm the Chief Operating Officer for the school system, and I'm responsible for a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1406)|
| 0:23:33| Maintenance and custodial is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Transportation, food service, security, we coordinate with IT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| So, you know, basically anything that's not HR or finance or curricular sort of falls under me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1420)|
| 0:23:49| And I know the letter you're talking about, and we put a response together to Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1429)|
| 0:23:57| I don't know if that's gone out yet or not, if that's still in draft form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| But we've looked at that technology, the ultraviolet technology, and several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| And as we look at ultraviolet, it has proven to be very effective in certain applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1447)|
| 0:24:15| The application that's most effective in is sterilization of water because of the way the water moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| and how you're able to get the light to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| It is not as effective in managing particles that may be airborne or in our HVAC systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1464)|
| 0:24:33| The places where it has been used in HVAC systems are generally to throw an ultraviolet light on the HVAC coils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1473)|
| 0:24:42| so that they don't become a medium for the growth of different molds and bacterias and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| It also has an expense to it in that the lights have to be replaced every couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| It has an element of safety associated with it, too, for the techs that have to open up the equipment and work with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1497)|
| 0:25:05| So we looked at that piece of that technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| We looked at another technology that has, and I'm trying to remember off the top of my head here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| that has shown some promise in HVAC systems, but it was still not as effective as we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| There is an oxygen specie type technology that we have looked at that doesn't necessarily go in the HVAC systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1522)|
| 0:25:36| We've tested it ourselves in a couple of locker rooms where we had some concerns about bacteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| and we feel like that has been very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| But when you go back and you look at all of these technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| if we were to make a decision to put one in regardless of how effective it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| we're talking, depending on the technology, between $5 million and $10 million for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| and we're not there at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| While you're here, we had a question from Ms. Carr about how we plan to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| or ensure social distancing on school buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| And in general, anything you can tell us about transportation will be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Well, let me start with social distancing then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Social distancing on a school bus is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| It's not really operationally feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Everybody that has provided us some sort of guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| what they tell us to do on the school buses is put a kid in every other seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| and, oh, by the way, stagger them from side to side as you go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1599)|
| 0:26:44| On our largest buses, that cuts our ridership to about 10 as opposed to 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1604)|
| 0:26:52| And that's a problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| In Knox County, that cuts our capacity from 70% to 90%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1615)|
| 0:27:01| and that means that we would have to make up that lost capacity in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| And for us, that would be adding about 200 buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| That's not really feasible either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| That's about a $20 million expense, even if you can find the drivers to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1634)|
| 0:27:20| And in this short a time period, you know, buses are not something you just run out and buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| You have to order them many, many, many months in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| So that's not really feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| So what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| Well, I think we can take some steps to mitigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| We can run our buses and take some steps to mitigate the fact that we can't socially distance like we would like to on the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| And that mitigation that we've been talking about is in the form of frequently disinfecting the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| We'll disinfect them after the morning runs and after the evening runs so that we're always starting with a clean bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| We'll ask students to wear a mask while they're on the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| and we'll also mandate that the drivers and contractors wear a mask while they're on the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| Another thing that we can look at is operating the bus with the windows down if the weather permits so we're constantly circulating air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| We do have some buses that have air conditioning on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| and our thought would be to go ahead and continue to use that air conditioning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| but make sure that we're not operating it in a recirculation mode, that it's pulling in fresh air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| It's not just recirculating the air within the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| So that's about the best that we can get to at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Now, the figures you gave us with regards to the buses, that was with respect to purchasing them, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| Have you looked at numbers for contracting that service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| We contract for buses, but if we were to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| our contractors would have to buy new buses and hire additional drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and the cost would be in the same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Ms. Pickler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Regarding the cleaning frequency, whether it's in the bus or in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| what kind of cleaning supplies or what kind of cleaning solution is used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| I'm hoping we're not talking a Clorox wipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Well, let's talk about that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| We use a solution that's provided to us through Kelsan by a manufacturer called Midlab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| If anybody wants to look it up, the product we use is HP202,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| and it is one of the few products on the market that has been certified COVID effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| and our intent at this point is to daily we have procured a number of misting machines that we're going to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1782)|
| 0:29:56| and we've still got about 40, I think, due in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| but to daily apply the HP202 with a mister in all of our common areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| hallways, libraries, administration areas, the gymnasium, the cafeteria, and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| so that we mist those at least every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| We'll also go through and either mist or hand wipe with the HP202 all of our high contact areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1815)|
| 0:30:22| like doorknobs and handrails and countertops and administrative areas and those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| We're going to try to, our intent going in is to mist classrooms on an every other day basis so that that gets covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1830)|
| 0:30:39| I would like to do it on a daily basis, but I don't know how the time's going to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| We know that we're going to have to look at how our custodians are scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| and we're probably going to have to schedule some overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| and we're probably going to have to bring custodians in earlier in the day right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| The way we have it set up is we have an early custodian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| and then the rest of the team comes in sometime after lunch and then works until, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| depending on if you're in an elementary school or a secondary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| until somewhere between 8 in the evening and 11 in the evening, so we're going to have to adjust that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| Hiring custodians is a challenge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| I can tell you that we run about a 10% vacancy rate on any given day, and that's what we're running right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| And I can tell you that with unemployment payments the way they are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| and the level that they are right now, we're not getting a lot of takers on our vacancies for custodial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| so we hope that will change here in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| What about the possibility of doing, like, temperature checks before children actually get on the bus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| We talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| I know that the special ed buses have to have teaching assistants on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| so could somebody do a temperature check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| And that would be a good quick screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| considering the fact that it doesn't look like there's any plans to social distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| Now, my second question is what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| Can I answer your first one first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| We discussed about the feasibility of doing temperature checks before students get on buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| and I have a significant safety concern about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| If we've got a bus stopped in a roadside stop onboarding kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| and it takes us, you know, four or five minutes to get all of the temperatures checked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| we're at a much higher risk every minute that bus is sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| than if we can get it back in traffic and moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| So we think it's in everybody's best benefit or to their best welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| that we do the temperature checks when we get in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| You had a second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Is there any way, I mean, masks are not alone preventative of spreading the disease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| social distancing and masks, because it's spread by aerosols from mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| So would there be any ideas about maybe putting some sort of plexiglass or dividers in the seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| so at least children stay separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I've seen grocery stores that may be totally out, you know, out of question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| Let me say just off the top of my head, I would be reluctant to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| because of the way the buses are designed and the safety specifications where they're designed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| And I don't know if we'd put something in there if we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| doing something that would change the safety specs of the bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| or that would become a danger to a child in an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| So I think we have to be really careful about modifying the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| We have a couple more questions for Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Jason, you already started to talk a little bit about special populations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| but we didn't speak specifically about English language learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| Could you speak about how we're going to make sure that they are able to participate fully?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| I'm actually going to have our ELL supervisor address that for you all that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| She can address any follow-up questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Sharon Kate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Yes, I'm Sharon Kate, and I'm the ELL supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| And what Jason has already addressed about that our population is very different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| even though they speak different languages, they're coming from very different educational backgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| So this spring we offered videos for our newcomers who had very, very low English level proficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| And then for our upper levels, we worked with the content supervisors to make accommodations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2086)|
| 0:34:54| within those lessons that they were presenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| And so that's two things that I see continuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| The other thing that I see continuing and that will really help is the one-to-one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| and making that available because, to be honest with you, most of our ELL students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| those were the ones who did not have the computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| And so thank you, Knox County Schools, for going one-to-one to help our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| While you're here, I had a person call me from an organization that works with non-English language speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2124)|
| 0:35:35| and they said that the bigger concern for them was not so much the computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| because they felt confident you were going to be able to get them that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| and some other people were going to be able to work on access, but just the ability to use computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2145)|
| 0:35:51| It's still not something that a lot of our English language learner families have the skills in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| because in their home countries they didn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| That is a great point, and I'm glad you brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Our community agencies have really been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Centro Español, during the month of June, they have been providing parent workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| We've been partnering with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| And so one of the things that I see happening is offering some parent education classes to help them navigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2175)|
| 0:36:23| The other thing that I would like to mention is that we have, I think it was in March of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| we opened up five different language websites, things like, that are very easy to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| We have five different Facebook pages in Spanish, Chinese, Kurundi, Swahili, and Arabic that we post information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2195)|
| 0:36:44| And we can post how to access things on there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| So far, most of our questions have been about either safety or equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| I want to go a little more into the curricular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| John, I think most of these are going to be in your area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| So you might want to go ahead and come up and find the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2228)|
| 0:37:18| First question actually came from me, and I asked it to you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| I just want to make sure that everybody hears the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| Teaching in person and teaching online are really, really different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| One of the options that you're considering is a hybrid model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| Will teachers be expected, classroom teachers be expected to manage a classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| at the same time they're managing perhaps half their classes at home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| How will we manage that situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| So in the survey that went out, we were looking at different options that were out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| just to kind of get perceptions of people as far as where they were leaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| or what parents and students and teachers and administrators were comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| So really we tried to list those different options for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| not trying to drive toward any one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| And I think if you look at the results of that, the return live was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| I'm going to ballpark the four together, was roughly 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| So obviously that was the one that people mostly wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| The hybrid came in second, and then third was online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And we think mainly, as we understand, students being in school kind of drives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| a lot of the economy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| People need to go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Families need to do those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| So it wasn't surprising to us on that that it kind of came out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| There are challenges of all three of those models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| As you know, going live, we've talked a little bit most of the conversation today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| about sanitation, about at-risk and fragile students and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| So there's a risk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Online, you don't have the teacher for proximity of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| Students acting up, a student disengages, they can't step over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| they can't cold call that student to be able to pull them out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| It's a lot more difficult in an online situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| Plus, again, parents need to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| Grandparents need to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| So you have those kinds of situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| So that's not totally ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Hybrid is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| You've kind of pointed to the challenge for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| As we look, there are different models for hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| There are some school systems that have looked at an AM-PM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| where you would have some students go first half of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| some students go second half of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| And as Russ kind of looked through transportation costs for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| that would be extremely expensive to add another run of buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| kind of what he talked about with the run of buses for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| adding the social distancing on the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| So that would be very difficult for us to pull off financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| The model that makes the most sense for us would be kind of an alternating day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| So sometimes you may see an A day, B day kind of model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| That could look a couple different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| It could be if you look at a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| it could be half of the students that are taking elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| so maybe half of a teacher's class go on Monday and Tuesday in a live classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| while the other half is doing the remote lesson that's loaded there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Maybe there's a virtual day on a Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| and then maybe it switches for the Thursday, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Like that would be one possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| The main reason for a hybrid is that you have fewer students in the hallways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2414)|
| 0:40:18| and in the cafeteria and in those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| so you're able to social distance a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| But, Jerry, you pointed out the big challenge in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Now, as a teacher, I have to plan for my live students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| and then how am I supposed to support those remotely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| Again, parents would have to help us with that and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Of the three, I was a parent who got to fill out the Alma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| That was my least favorite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| I think it's the one that probably presents the most challenges for our teaching staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| who already is pretty taxed to do what they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| So I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Mr. Cummings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| Just one question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| I understand that there are three different models that are being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| but the concern that's been brought to me is that what happens if a student tests positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| which we know is going to happen at some point within a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| How do we approach that from an educational standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Do we close that school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| What happens district-wide with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Sure, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| I'll say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| We have had students and we have had faculty even last semester where that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| As Jason pointed to, we work with Dr. Buchanan and the Health Department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| There really is kind of a community health piece there because you have certain privacy protections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| and stuff for both the students and for the teachers when it comes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Usually we work with the Health Department talking through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Obviously Russ can give you a lot more details on the sanitation and how we go about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| but there are certain teams of folks who come in and do that in a required way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2502)|
| 0:41:49| The Health Department has told us before there's not a need in certain situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| as we talk through that situation to close it for the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| We haven't had kids in school yet either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| so that could change when you have a classroom or multiple classrooms full of students and that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| So far to date when that's happened it's been just staff in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| and or something happening where a student acquired that not at school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| and then it was an extracurricular or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| We would again continue to work with them and follow their guidance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| but definitely on the disinfecting and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| Ms. Pickler asked the question if we are considering online instruction platforms other than Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2543)|
| 0:42:33| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Actually Zoom is not one of our preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| I think Zoom is great at marketing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| so they got out there quick and early and offered a lot of free stuff and it was pretty easy to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| The two that we use the most if you're in that environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| a learning management system is kind of the package by which teachers load and interface with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2569)|
| 0:42:56| It's not the software, but it's the program by which they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| So you may have heard a thing like Google has a platform for that Google Classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| We actually use Canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Canvas is one that the University of Tennessee uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| We've been using that for about six, seven years I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| And so very well trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| It's really kind of the cream of the crop when it comes to learning management systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| but it allows a lot more functionality than something like a Google Classroom would do or some of those other ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2598)|
| 0:43:25| So that is really our main form as far as students submitting and being able to watch videos of classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| and interfacing and take quizzes and do all that can be done within Canvas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| And then we, Microsoft Teams, is the one that we prefer as far as a video kind of service where you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| It works with our Microsoft package that we have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| They've actually continued to upgrade throughout this COVID-19 where originally they had a certain number of pains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2623)|
| 0:43:50| that could come up at one time as students you could see, and they've continued to increase that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| So all of our teachers are trained in both of those, and those will be our preferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| although we allow a whole lot of different apps and things that work with Canvas that we would allow teachers to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| Mr. Henley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| Nothing will ever be better than a teacher in a classroom interacting with his or her students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| But what we're faced with is we're trying to hit a moving target, which is very, very tough to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2651)|
| 0:44:17| I don't envy your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| But if we have what happened last spring, basically where students and teachers are told to stay home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2660)|
| 0:44:33| they cannot come to school, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| It's imperative that we have an alternative because our children cannot lose that kind of instruction time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2676)|
| 0:44:47| I know it's cumbersome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| I know it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| I know it's inconvenient and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| And I think you all are doing a remarkable job developing everything that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| I'm extremely pleased and impressed with whatever that's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| But, you know, we have to make this distance learning thing work, in my opinion, okay, as a backup, as a backup and backup only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2703)|
| 0:45:16| And, you know, the connectivity issues, the supervision, you know, who makes sure the child is actually on the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2716)|
| 0:45:26| doing what they're supposed to be doing and so on and so forth, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| Those are all questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| The instruction, I mean, you know, how do we get, how do we make it equitable for every child?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2732)|
| 0:45:40| Because some children, you know, have a lot of parental support and other kids, unfortunately, don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| So how do we mitigate that and help those children maintain, okay, the same level of achievement as the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2747)|
| 0:45:57| And I personally think it's going to have to take a lot of cooperation between a lot of people to make this thing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| If, in fact, I mean, we don't know what phase we're going to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| The governor just extended the phase that we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| So we don't know, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| And, you know, parents and students and educators, administrators are all going to have to come together and make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2775)|
| 0:46:25| and I think, just one member of the task force, and make distance learning work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| It's not, it's not the end all, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| But if you're forced to stay home for a month or two months, you know, you have to make, and if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| I'm glad to hear the chamber and a lot of other organizations are stepping up because we need a lot of volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| We need a lot of volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| You know, these kids need help with their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| You know, maybe a lot of different organizations can volunteer to help these kids, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| with their homework or with their online learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| But we've got to be able to try to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| If we shut down again, we can't afford to shut down for two more months without learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| You need to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| I mean, I think you pointed out some of the challenges that are definitely there with online learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| and I think across the nation, you know, people are trying to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I mean, even colleges and universities and, you know, trying to, the same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| You heard a lot of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| I know I teach part-time with UT sometimes, too, and it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| I have to move to an online class to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| It's very different when you can see the students and feel the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| and talk with the students and kind of get a feel for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| Mr. Fortner, you had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| Back to the question about when someone tests positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| Do we not have protocols in place right now of, you talked about cleaning and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| but what happens when we have a positive test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| Everyone keeps asking that question, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Are we closing a class, a grade, a hallway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Do we have protocols in place for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| And so I would say this, again, without disclosing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| we have had already students and faculty and those sorts of things that have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| While they were in school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Well, schools then, yeah, well, yeah, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Yes, actually, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| And so, again, there are lots of things we have to do to protect their identities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| and those sorts of things and their health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| So I think the reason it's hard to kind of paint the box around we would do this every time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| is because certain situations are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| And so that's why we try to go back to the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| and we try to work through our things and see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| Because there's sometimes, you know, it may have been a small place where that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| or maybe a person just had exposure to one room, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| and so that's something we can get in overnight and take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| There may be something where it was multiple students who were exposed to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| or multiple adults who were exposed in different parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| And so that may require us to do more or to close down and to make sure of those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| So, you know, again, to say any time there's one that happens, this is immediate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2939)|
| 0:49:04| we shut the school down for X days or do something like that, that makes us probably feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2944)|
| 0:49:11| But I think, you know, when we talked to the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| some of the discussions that we had with them were that, you know, that's great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| but you could really probably knock it out by doing these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| So we want to be responsive but not overreact too because, you know, as you all made a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| trying to educate students is our number one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| But safety is our number one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| We're 40 days out and I think that would help alleviate a lot of stress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| if KCS could somehow say this is what we've got in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| We're losing really good families to private school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| And I think we just need to get in front and say this is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| If and when this happens, we've got plans in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Mr. Gailenwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| I have two quick questions if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| The first one is, so I'm a fan of science, math, and all those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| but I'm also a fan of the arts and physical activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| And so I guess I'm curious what that looks like at every level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| And the second question is more about the teachers because I have lots of friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| that are teachers and administrators and how are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| I guess right now what's their temperature, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Are they okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| So I'll take the first question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| So you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| I mean, all subjects are extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| And I think you see that when you get into high schools, all those are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| It's not just kind of what we think about the four accountability subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| There are career and tech ed pathways that are part of graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| There are arts programs part of graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| And so they're extremely important as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| And so we have not just trained just the core academic teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| we've trained everyone to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| So our thought would be that we're able to get everyone to be able to go online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3044)|
| 0:50:49| Now, the truth of the matter is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| How about in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| What about in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Still do those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Oh, yes, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| Yeah, all of those courses are considered the same as we would if we were live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| and doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| We would still consider doing those courses as we usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| So I think some of the challenge would be if you go online or you're going hybrid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3065)|
| 0:51:09| you have a situation, some of those classes are kind of performance oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| You know, you can do so much theory and music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| or you can do so much learning about building in a kind of shop or CTE class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| but there comes a time you have to enter the lab, science lab, same kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| So you have some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| So obviously we have to modify for online if it was fully online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| And that's one of the advantages of a hybrid model is maybe there are some days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| you can go in and do some of the performance based things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| But, again, we've talked about some of the things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| As far as how are our teachers and our administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| I'll tell you and echo what Mr. Unley said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| There is no substitute for a teacher in front of a class of students teaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| I think what I saw from teachers and talking to teachers so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| was kind of how their hearts were ripped out of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| by not seeing their kids and not having that through the whole spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| You know, they get their energy and their purpose from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| and I think we thought about just them taking care of their families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| and all those things, but we really, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| processed what that did to them kind of socially and emotionally for what that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| And the kids, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| And the kids, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| So there are lots of good stories where there were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Zoom calls and things like that, but they're not the hugs at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| We did have lots of things that were kind of drive-by kind of end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| where there were kind of parades and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| So, again, our teachers do what they always did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| They stepped up to the plate to still care for their kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| and know that the relationship was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| But we definitely want to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Administrators the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| I mean, they've been very flexible, very understanding, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| through rough budget year, the superintendent did a good job talking with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| And we want to maintain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| We don't want them to run away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| So they're the crux of what we do and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| So I echo what you say for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Ms. Craig?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Yes, do you see a scenario where we would be shut down again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| with no distance learning happening at all, even with our laptops out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| Yeah, you know, I would hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| I mean, I think we have, again, the two hurdles were the devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| and then the Internet connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| So I think we have kind of looking through as you see those options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| we have the ability to do those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| Now, does that mean there's not going to be someone who's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| we're going to have to do some one-offs with some figuring out some different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| things with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| But I think by and large we could move to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| And, again, let me say this too, not perfection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| This is going to be about grace and learning and innovating as we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| this year because there's going to be a lot of things that are new experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| for extended periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Some people won't miss a beat because they've been doing it for a long period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| of time and that's kind of their preferred method.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Some people, you know, weren't the early adopters on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| so they're going to be figuring some of those things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| So we'll need definitely grace with that and it won't be perfect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| but I do think that we have the ability to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| Dr. Graham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I don't envy your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| There are specific general protocols for maintaining health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| and it's, you know, it's hand washing, social distancing, masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3242)|
| 0:54:07| I mean, one, you know, there's a probability of very high contagion, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| if there's no social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| There's still a high contagion level if there's a mask and social distancing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| So, like, and then, of course, we want kids to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| have their temperatures taken before they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Why couldn't Knox County have a, like, standard protocol that's communicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| throughout the whole system repeatedly to, like, families and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| and teachers and say, okay, this has to be done every day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| I mean, I was kind of bouncing off Mr. Hundley's suggestion that it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| to be kind of a community effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| So, rather than it just being on the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| why not have something like that put out regularly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| So, that would be one for just standard protocol for if you want in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| Second is I talked with a group of families this weekend who have children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| with pretty significant disabilities, and they're in all those school buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| as well, and it's not just a Jason question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| This is an everybody question because they are in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| How are they going to – they feel like they haven't had any communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| So, I'm thinking if there was some just general information put out kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| at a regular basis, parents wouldn't feel like they don't know anything at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| because I think right now they're feeling we don't know anything that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| and I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| We can't predict the future, but something kind of regular would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| So, we've got a couple of different questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| Well, the first was about aren't there some standard guidelines we could provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| Your child must come to school with a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| We're going to ask every child to wash their hands every class period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Whatever the kind of guidelines are, you guys are the pros,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| are there guidelines that one could do even if they were aspirational?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| So, this is what we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| And is that a doable deed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| Yeah, I would think that that would be a great insight from this bunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| from this group, this task force that's kind of brought together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| and I think those are great things that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| I think, yes, for sure we could do that, and I think you've seen some plans that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| have come out, the university's plan, things like that, that do list some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| and I think that's a great suggestion of things we could look at to do, posters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Just some kind of regular communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Well, that's the second part of the question, I think, is communications in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| Piggyback off of that, because the parents are really worried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| So, I'm sure you have a communications plan, and you may not, John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| you may not be the person to talk about it, but is there a communication plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| like from now through the beginning of school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| Mr. Thomas, take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| Thanks, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Yes, we're working on that, and great suggestion, and we've said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| all along we're going to be back in school practicing safe methods, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| for our students and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| So, the plan right now, and again, someone could interrupt that in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| the higher authority to say no, that you're not going to have school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| but our plan is to be back in school, and we know that some parents are probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| not going to send their child to school, so we will have an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3452)|
| 0:57:37| for parents who do not wish to send their child to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| Also, we probably are going to have some employees who may not return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| and we'll have a plan for addressing that issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| But I think you've heard, we had the staff here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| a very talented group of folks, very knowledgeable group of folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3473)|
| 0:57:56| and we're looking at everything we can look at in order to get back in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3476)|
| 0:58:02| and to do that in a safe manner for our students and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3482)|
| 0:58:06| And we know the parents want, from what the survey said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| parents want to get us back, they want us back in school, and that's the plan for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| And as Mr. Hundley mentioned too, if we're not in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| then we're going to have a plan for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| So, we're working on all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| I'll be making a presentation to the board on the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Again, I met with four focus groups, students, parents, teachers, and principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3505)|
| 0:58:31| and heard their concerns, and that is helping us to formulate, I guess, our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| So, just from the standpoint of being back in school, we plan to be back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3517)|
| 0:58:43| Okay. Mr. Hundley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| Yes, I'd like to ask if this is still the state requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| It was years ago when I was more involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| but is the state requirement still four and a half instruction hours per day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| I think the guideline is six and a half hours, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| The last correspondence that we received from the state was 180 student days and six and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| So, it has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| It's gotten a lot more rigorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3555)|
| 0:59:16| Now I know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| My question, on the students who decide that they don't want to come to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| and would like to do at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| and teachers who feel like they can't be back in a classroom for whatever health reasons or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| I had some teachers contact me saying, once they make that decision, are they locked into that decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| Because they said it would be a nightmare for them to have children coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Well, I changed my mind because everybody's having so much fun at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| I want to go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| The back and forth for a teacher would be difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| And we, Renee, who's our chief of staff, we talked about that this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| We got a meeting with Mr. Dupler, Gary Dupler of our law department to try to work out some procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| My feeling about that is, if you make the decision you're not going to be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| I hesitate to say if a parent changes their mind, hey, wait a minute, I've changed my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| I want my child to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| Then I think we need to allow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Now, the thing about going back and forth is going to be a bit of a headache,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| and we'll try to put some procedures in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| But as was mentioned a minute ago, what if a student does test positive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| And what if there are two or three students right around that particular student who need to be quarantined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3629)|
| 1:00:39| Then what we're going to try to do, well, that student, if they're quarantined, they're out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| But I don't think we can say, well, you're out of school for the rest of the semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| We're going to have to bring you back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| So I hesitate to say that a procedure is, if you commit to online, then that's the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3650)|
| 1:00:59| You're going to be online for nine weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| I think we're going to have to have some flexibility with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| Some parents have said, hey, gosh, I may hold my child out for two or three weeks just to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3666)|
| 1:01:12| And, you know, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3672)|
| 1:01:13| I mean, as a parent, you know, you're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| So after two or three weeks and things are running smoothly, maybe I decide, hey, I want my child to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| Then I think we have to have a way to get them back in school at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| So we want to be as flexible with that as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| but keeping in mind that you can't be in school one week, out of school the next week, in school, you know, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3688)|
| 1:01:35| So we can't – I don't want abuse of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| So we'll take a look at that as far as staff is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| Scott, I don't know if you – I know Scott Bolton here, he's our executive director of HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3702)|
| 1:01:47| might talk a little bit about, you know, from the teacher standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| We're going to need some more information from parents and our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| which we'll be getting that out pretty soon to say, hey, tell us what your intentions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| I'm not holding you to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| If I'm a parent and I get a survey that says, well, how do you feel about sending your child to school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| if we have safety measures in place, a parent may, you know, at that point tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| We've got to have some idea, you know, about the students to expect, you know, when school starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| and we have to have some idea about employees too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| So we're going to be asking parents and employees for some additional information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| just knowing, hey, it could all change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| We see the numbers going up right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| That's not a good sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| But we have got to have some information in terms of staffing and class schedules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| So we will be asking parents and employees for some additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| So, Scott, why don't you talk about the employee piece of that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3771)|
| 1:02:52| That's a great concern to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| I mean, our teachers and our staff mean the world to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Okay, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| So that is a concern for us, but I think one of the things we've got to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| is the intent of folks that intend on coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| You know, we realize that that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| There are going to be some folks that may have a compromised immune system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| that may have some concerns about coming back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| and there are going to be some procedures in place that will allow for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| to exhaust some of our leave policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Will it allow for us to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| There's FFCRA, things that they're entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3805)|
| 1:03:32| And so we're going to try to walk through that as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| when we're talking about the leave policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| And still, I mean, we've got to educate students, and so that's what our business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| And so we've got to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| and how we best can do that with the folks that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| We have another question that came from Mr. Fortner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3832)|
| 1:03:59| And we touched on this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| but I'm going to give the administration a chance to add anything else they want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| He said, I'm concerned about the lost emotional content from spring semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| I think a lot of us have that feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| I'd like to know what KCS is planning for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| and being supportive of time dedicated to addressing the emotional needs of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| if and when we go back to in-person classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| Missing the social aspect of being in school has been detrimental to so many students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| We've seen emotional impacts on our own children, and we have very stable home life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| I hope that we won't rush to catch up on instructional content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| We don't take the time to address the kids' emotional needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| and help them process what's happening around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| I have to say, Mr. Fortner, thank you for that heartfelt question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3880)|
| 1:04:45| I'm hearing that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| We've got both for kids who will be in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| and they've got a whole world of chaos around them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| but also for the kids who are not able to have that kind of social support that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| And I'm going to add one more thing for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3902)|
| 1:05:07| The organizations that I've talked to who deal with child abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3907)|
| 1:05:15| are seeing pretty dramatic drops in reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| because we know that our school personnel are instrumental in reporting instances of suspected child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3920)|
| 1:05:29| Have we thought about any of that as we go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| Sure, I'll try to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| Our Department of School Culture has done a lot of work around this, Janice Cook and her team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Janice isn't here tonight, so I'll do my best, Janice Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| We totally agree, and that's exactly how we're approaching this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| Obviously, we're going to have to meet the social and emotional needs of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| before we can dive right into our academic curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3955)|
| 1:05:58| There's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| Her team has already made some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| One significant change they've made is they've front-loaded all the social-emotional learning standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3962)|
| 1:06:07| that our counselors are held to, that they deliver to our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| We're front-loading that onto the start of the school year so that we can dig right into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| Her team is also going to work with schools to ensure that every child has a direct connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| with an adult in their school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| In addition to that, our counselors, and they do this annually anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| will also be conducting needs assessments with our students that really is just intended to help our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| and our families access resources, so determining what it is that they need so that we can best serve our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=3995)|
| 1:06:42| We'll be utilizing partners in the community, such as we have a partnership with Helen Ross McNabb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| that we will obviously utilize for particularly our secondary students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| For our kids with disabilities, we have our therapeutic professional partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| so that we have available therapies for those students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| The Department of School Culture has really put together a solid plan that really places focus on those social-emotional needs for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4020)|
| 1:07:10| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| Mr. Chair, if I may ask a subsequent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Has there been any consideration given to the support for teachers and staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| Provided that we go back to school, we're going to be asking them to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| under a number of just all types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| So is there any thought being given to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4050)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you for asking that, actually, because that was on my list of things to talk about, and I've managed to not mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| But, yes, Ms. Cook and her team have already designed learning modules for our staff to prepare them to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4056)|
| 1:07:43| in what will be a more intense environment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| Like some of these, you know, the issues of anxiety and those things, those are not new issues to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| We see those every day, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| But we're going to have an influx of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| So we want our staff to be as prepared as we possibly can be, and they're also going to be pairing that not just to prepare them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| but also have structures in place that will support teachers as they work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| Because certainly, you know, I don't think anybody here is ignoring the challenge that lays before our teachers and our staff, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4087)|
| 1:08:15| Jason, while you're up, we had a question, and this is probably a brief answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| but who specifically are we working with to develop our safety protocols for when we're back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4100)|
| 1:08:28| We assume you're working with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| You've kind of referred to the health department several times tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Are there national organizations that you're depending on for guidance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| Are there state health departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| I mean, who are we leaning on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Because we all have a lot of expertise, but we only have expertise where we have expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| and this is a pretty highly specific area, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| You know, we lean very heavily on our local health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| When we have, you know, if we hit something, you know, we immediately reach out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| I talk very frequently with Charity Menefee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| We, as recently as two weeks ago, set in on a meeting where they sort of outlined what their thoughts were for starting school back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| So, yeah, we're definitely working very closely with our health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| and that's actually ‑‑ I'm going to have my health services supervisor, Lisa Wagner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| come up and talk a little bit, not just about that partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| but exactly how some of these protocols are going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| I know Dr. Reiswick touched on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| But, you know, we actually have a pretty robust response to these when we have an incident, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| when we have whether it's any infectious disease, not just COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| And I'm going to have Lisa talk just a little bit about the work we do with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| As it relates to contact tracing and determining how we're going to communicate and with whom, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| because the health department is not just a one‑size‑fits‑all blanket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| We're going to do this every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4195)|
| 1:09:56| So I'm going to turn it over to Lisa just for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| I guess I need to take my mask off so you can hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| So we work very closely with the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| So say if we have something that occurs like COVID-19 or any kind of infectious disease, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4209)|
| 1:10:18| we contact the health department and they tell us, you know, what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| So this year, well, we have so far, I've done a little contact tracing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| And say we have a, like I said before, a diagnosis in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| then me and the health department communicate and we contact everybody that's around that particular person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| And we'll be expanding that when school starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| And some of the other protocols are, say we have someone that has COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4250)|
| 1:10:58| Based on those first criteria, you know, I would contact the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| If I found out first, I would contact the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| And if the health department found out before us, they would contact me or Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| And then we would go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| And so some of the protocols that they suggested was, say they have a temp of 100.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| Mr. Fortin, and you could ask if somebody was next to them, if they, you know, what would they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4283)|
| 1:11:29| So what would happen would be that that child that was next to them, it's according to how long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| but say they were in the classroom all day, then that person would have to be quarantined for 14 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| That was next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| That highlights the question that was asked earlier about people who are in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| There has to be a seamless way that a person who is forced to stay home for two weeks is able to keep up on their academic work at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4311)|
| 1:12:00| And the one who's diagnosed, their isolation is 10 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| providing that they don't have any symptoms, you know, for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| That's the policy that's in place right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| That's the policy for the whole system right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| Yes, and that's what the state, that's the state guidelines as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| I think that's precisely the kinds of things Mr. Fortner was encouraging us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| to put in writing so that the parents will have some sense that we actually have thought through this in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| I know, you know, we know, but the parents who are out there making a living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| they may not know that all of that has been thought through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| I think, Ms. Grimm, you had asked a question about placing posters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| Just kind of generalized, consistent messages, communication, newspaper, TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Here's your bulleted list of five things you want to look for in your child, what they can do to stay safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| I mean, just simple strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Just to kind of have it out there so people know before, you know, students can start school, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| what to do while you're in school, what to do, you know, if you think you've contracted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| I mean, just simple kind of communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| I think, I mean, I'm pretty sure we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| And so, you know, you want to stay home when you're sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| You want to cover your cough into your elbow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| But when I met with the families of students with significant health impairments, I mean disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4411)|
| 1:13:39| and they were very, very worried about what would happen, you know, if any of their children contracted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| Because if some of them, if they catch it, they're going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| And they also have family members who, for whatever reason, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| anybody on steroids is susceptible to getting COVID because steroids lowers your, you know, that immune system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4434)|
| 1:14:02| So they were really worried about, you know, family members and then their students having to miss school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| So I guess Jason could kind of answer that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Jason, do you have an additional comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| And what the nurse's role is going to be for the students that actually have a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| Like what's their role going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Is that going to affect their child's, you know, nurse and the surrounding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| We have students that have one-to-one nurses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Because they require those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Yeah, like 65 or something like that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| 65 one-on-one nurses maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| Not for, I mean, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| Whatever, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| But anyway, that nurse that's assigned to that student will only take care of that student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| And the nurses in the building will work with, you know, each student that comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4485)|
| 1:14:52| Say you have a student that's sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| You know, we would isolate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Like if they had a fever of 100.4 and contact the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| To pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Mr. Gilmore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| You got a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| I think about, so, and I understand taking temperatures at doors, and I think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| magnitude of that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| And I guess I'm trying to wrap my mind around, can, and I know it's not possible in every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| case, but is there a way to lessen that burden through the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| And this is just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| This is what we're here, I think, to do is just maybe, is there a way to require the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| parents that have the capability or, I feel like there's a lot of that that falls on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| And I know that the kids, some people are going to go ahead and send their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| But to lessen the burden on the school day from the temperature standpoint, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| know what that looks like, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| I don't know if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| Just a curiosity question, and you deal with that every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| That would be great, but I really think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Not possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Well, I don't know, but I think, you know, best practice is for when the student comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| in to take their temperature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| You know, it follows up with what she's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| We put signs up everywhere, and sometimes we don't use common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| And I've heard even just in the past week where somebody showed up somewhere with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| fever, and it's like, you know, common sense just doesn't take hold every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| So I understand the need for taking temperatures, but there's also asymptomatic, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| And asymptomatic means you can take the temperature, and it's not going to be effective anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| What was your last name, Lisa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Wagoner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| A wagon and an ER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| And what's your.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Because a lot of people get it mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| And what's your capacity with KCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Beg your pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| What is your position with KCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Supervisor of Health Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| So has there been any thought given to our schools that do not have a nurse on staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| I know that we have some of our nurses are kind of itinerant, and they travel from school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| So what are we doing to ensure that there is, I guess, a presence of a health or medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| professional at the school, considering that we are under a pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| So the nurses go to different schools each day, and so it's not many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| It's just about five of them that travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| So they go to a different school each day, and if they're needed at a particular school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| for an emergency or anything, you know, they can contact them right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| They can contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| And, I mean, I'll be out there helping as well, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| Jerry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| I have a question for Professor Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| So one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| The state guidelines you mentioned, can we, what are those called so we can read those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4656)|
| 1:17:41| share those as needed with people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| You mentioned the state guidelines for when someone, is it just state guidelines on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| I can have Ms. Kelly send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| That would be fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| Mr. Hundley, you have a question for the superintendent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| I could keep talking about backups to backups, but let's say the first three backups, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4678)|
| 1:18:06| going to school, the hybrid or distance learning, have we, we contract with a lot of folks for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4686)|
| 1:18:13| products and services in Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| And Russ may be, you know, be able to do this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| But have we looked, have we taken a look, in worst case scenario, and I want everybody to know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4701)|
| 1:18:28| worst case scenario, have we looked at third party providers in terms of providing online content?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4708)|
| 1:18:39| You know, if we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| If we need that, that would be a, that would be a worst case scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| Yeah, let me, John, I don't know, you might be better suited to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| I don't think we, I'm not aware that we have third party that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4729)|
| 1:19:00| So secondary, secondary with edgenuity, but elementary for K-8 is going to be a little bit more challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4740)|
| 1:19:08| So 9-12 we could handle with edgenuity, and then elementary we'll have to do some more exploration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| Quick shift, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| Our charge was basically to respond to the data and to the surveys and focus group responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4759)|
| 1:19:29| I think that what those answers did was inspire a whole lot of questions for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4769)|
| 1:19:36| and we've all heard questions from people in the neighborhoods in which we live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| and the districts that we're representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| One of the things we all agreed to do at the end of the last meeting, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| was go back and take a deep dive into the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| And so I would like to know now, I'd like to shift for the next 15 minutes or so to what observations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4793)|
| 1:20:02| what questions emerged as you dug deeper into the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| So anybody have any observations or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| I think I've already expounded on enough of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| I'll defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| Not very good that you're deferring, but thank you for the courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| Yes, anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Well, I had several questions, but I don't think we're going to be able to answer them all tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Well, we're probably not going to answer them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| but the administration has confirmed that any questions that arise that they're not prepared to answer tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4832)|
| 1:20:41| they will prepare responses and get them out to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4841)|
| 1:20:45| So, Dr. Green, would you like to ask a couple, and then I'll let Mr. Brown ask a couple, and then we'll...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4845)|
| 1:20:51| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| Let me see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4853)|
| 1:21:01| I have several questions about CELS, the social-emotional learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4861)|
| 1:21:08| You know, this has been such a shock to the whole system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| I mean, it's not just the public school, it's the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4871)|
| 1:21:16| And I'm just hoping that there's some kind of system-wide plan that we can kind of put in place for every school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4876)|
| 1:21:24| and every child and every family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| So, I mean, that's just kind of the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| Could you use your microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| I can hardly hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| Could you use your microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Oh, I guess I should pick that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| The pandemic has really produced a shock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| So, I'm just wondering if there's going to be some extensive plans for children that have pretty severe social-emotional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4897)|
| 1:21:48| And some of those children are in the SPED population, special ed population, others are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| And so I'm just hoping that we have something in place for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| Plus, we have lots of children with autism, lots of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| and interrupting their routine can really disrupt their emotional stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| And so I'm just hoping that maybe there's some general protocols we can send out for families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| and at least prepare for that before any plans, you know, before the plans are made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| so that they know that they have some sort of consistent schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| Mr. Brown, would you like to ask a couple of questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Mine was just a concern dealing with the presence of health professionals in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| Presence of health professionals in the schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Yes, the presence of health professionals in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| With us being under this pandemic, and I guess this may be a question for Dr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| is our budget set and is it safe to say that there's no more money to hire any other personnel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4967)|
| 1:22:57| Because with this, you know, pandemic being upon us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| I just don't feel comfortable with us having our students go back in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| and us not having adequate representation of health professionals in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Our budget is set, so it would not be a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| now if it's a situation where it's a medical fragile child, then we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| we'll have, we do usually have positions that are not budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| If it's for a situation like a medically fragile child who would require a nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5004)|
| 1:23:29| but in terms of hiring nurses to make sure that there's a nurse in every school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| no, we don't have the funds for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| So, as Lisa mentioned, we've got several that travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| I know we've had some schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| Lisa, real quick, how many, do we have about 50, how many nurses do we have, you know, off the top of your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5022)|
| 1:23:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| Eighty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Eighty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| So, and again, some of those I think are dedicated to maybe just one individual student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5034)|
| 1:23:59| So, you know, from the standpoint of budget, we're doing the best we can with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| But if it's a situation that requires hiring of a nurse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| and Jason usually comes to us with that request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| and we'll honor that request whether it's budgeted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| We just, at the end of the year, have to settle up budget with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| So, we're not going to leave a child in a situation where they don't have the health requirements that need to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5056)|
| 1:24:25| Well, I just have a budget question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| because a recent cost analysis from the School Superintendents Association nationally said that for all school systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5067)|
| 1:24:35| generally it's going to cost an extra $490 per student just to purchase a nurse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| It's going to cost an extra $490 per student just to purchase hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, cleaning supplies, gloves, masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5082)|
| 1:24:50| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| So, is there anything this task force can do to leverage our recommendations to get more funds for Knox County schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5091)|
| 1:25:00| I know, it's laughable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| If you prefer not to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| What can we do to leverage that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| Because we're facing, like, a real, real dilemma here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| and I feel like we're kind of pushing Sisyphus Rock up the mountain when you have a budget that says you can only spend this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5114)|
| 1:25:22| and we have a school system with needs that are far beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| Well, of course, the legislative body is the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| so in terms of funding, it would take a recommendation from the mayor to the county commission to get additional funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5131)|
| 1:25:39| and I think we spent a couple of hours last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5139)|
| 1:25:43| The budget was set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| However, the commission did amend the budget to pay deputies, I think, a $1,500 bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5144)|
| 1:25:53| but it's like a two-hour discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| So, the mayor would have to make a recommendation, and the county commission would have to approve it in terms of additional funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| and we went through a situation with the state this year that we ended up having to, you know, the state actually cut the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| I know, I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| What was recommended in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| I know, I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| The 4% salary money was taken out of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| Well, there was a lot more than just salary money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| Okay, Mr. Brown, did you have a follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| Mine was the same as my colleague's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| I was going to ask you what can this task force do to help you and to ensure you need everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5186)|
| 1:26:32| that you have everything you need to be open and operating by August 10th, our teachers, our students are safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5192)|
| 1:26:38| and KCS can move forward with educating our children for our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| Just, again, I think making the needs known to folks that represent, you know, all the commission districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| that, you know, schools would like to see more funding for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| It's most likely too late this year to do anything since the budget is set, but I think in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| Each one of us, well, each one of you, I was appointed by the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| but each one of you was appointed by someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| The insights that you garnered from these discussions last week and this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| any insights that you think you would like to share with the person who appointed you would be welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| And let me just say, the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| I don't want to put you in a position where you're advocating a political stance from this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5244)|
| 1:27:32| We were not appointed for that purpose, and we don't want to put you between us and the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| So I think we need to take responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| If we have insights we want to share, we need to share those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| So, yes, sir, Mr. Ford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| I was reviewing the Hamilton County plan they released last night, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| That's when I started reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| So I was anxious to see what a big four school system was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| and they're using number of cases and active cases, percent of population as their metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| Can you share with what we're thinking about for our metric in terms of they've got four phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| and kind of what are we looking at for our metric for determining what we're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| Again, like we've talked about, I guess our advice from the health department in terms of looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| if the health department indicates to us that, hey, this is not advisable at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| then certainly we're going to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| But, you know, in terms of I think one thing that's being looked at, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| and I'm not saying this is Knox County schools, but hospitalizations, number of hospitalizations and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5308)|
| 1:28:34| that are increasing, number of cases that are increasing, we see them going up in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| But, again, we've been fortunate in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| and less affected maybe than some other areas across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| So that guidance from the health department and Lisa sits on the board, right, the Board of Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| and along with some other folks, so just the guidance from our health department is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| Do you see us kind of getting to that model where we'll have, you know, for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| once they hit a certain number of cases, they move to another phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| Do you see us going with that approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Or still is it going to be guidance from the health department kind of on the fly with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| I think the guidance from the health department is sometimes you see outbreaks of flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| I know COVID is not flu, but maybe it surfaces in one area more so than another area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5355)|
| 1:29:21| So it may be a situation where we just, if there are hot spots that flare up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| then we might have to make a decision based on that if the health department were to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| that a particular school maybe needs to be closed for a period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| then, again, we would seek the advice of the health department to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5377)|
| 1:29:42| Mr. Superintendent, I am hearing from a lot of people that they, and I think several of us are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5382)|
| 1:29:48| that to the degree we can articulate clearly the benchmarks that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5388)|
| 1:29:56| in consultation with the health department, I think that gives the parents in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| and the teachers for that matter, I think some stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5402)|
| 1:30:08| They say, you know, we're not making decisions on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| And I know you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| That's why I can say this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| But that we actually have some benchmarks we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| And if we pass those, we're going to change directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| That's an important thing for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5424)|
| 1:30:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Any other questions from the data itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| We heard in the initial presentation that, you know, over half of every category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5434)|
| 1:30:42| half or better of every category asked who wants to get back in school as long as we can do it safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| And I think that was the source of so many questions about what does it mean to be returning safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| So that's an observation I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| But that also means that almost half of people have significant concerns about going back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5456)|
| 1:31:02| And so this is a very ambiguous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| There's no clear consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| That was the overall impression I got from my looking at the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5468)|
| 1:31:14| There are just no easy answers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| And so we're going to have to ask our superintendent to make recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| using the best judgment that he can make in consultation with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5482)|
| 1:31:26| and experts throughout the state, his own team, and then the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| I don't want to say bless your heart, but I just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5492)|
| 1:31:39| You know, you've got a tough situation to decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| Let me shift, and we can always come back if there are additional questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| but we've got about a half hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| What message do you want me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| I'm going to be representing you at the workshop next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| What message do you want me to make sure that I say to the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| And, Rose, are you taking notes on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| Because I'm not going to be taking a lot of notes while I'm listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| What message do we need to make certain that we send to the school board based on what we've learned in these two meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| and, more importantly, based on what we've seen in the responses to the survey and the focus groups?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5537)|
| 1:32:27| Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5547)|
| 1:32:28| Again, we need to have multiple plans to fit the varying situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| And I would encourage them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| I think the staff has done a great job, and I appreciate everybody that spoke here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| They did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| You know, I come from a business background, and I'm constantly making alternative plans, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5561)|
| 1:32:48| And so many times, I'm not trying to equate business with schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| You can't equate the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| But if we have some very, very good, solid backup plans, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| the number one goal is to continue educating our children uninterrupted, safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5579)|
| 1:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| Others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| I would say just make sure that we, whatever plan or scenario we decide to go with, that it is thought through very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5594)|
| 1:33:25| And let's not put a price tag on our kids' safety and our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5611)|
| 1:33:32| Communication, communication, communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| We're 42 days out, and we've got to get information in front of our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| They're just making life decisions right now, and they're waiting on information from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5620)|
| 1:33:47| I think you need to add two more communications in there to get that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| Yeah, we hear that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| We're hearing that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| Others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| I think just from what I'm hearing, I commend all of the speakers as they spoke tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5637)|
| 1:34:06| and all the different plans that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| But I do, the feeling that I get from the community that I'm representing right now is that they do want to go back to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5648)|
| 1:34:16| They feel like the kids need to be back in front of the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| There are concerns, obviously, with the health and safety of the kids, and we can't discount those in any ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5659)|
| 1:34:26| But I think Knox County has done a great job of planning so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5666)|
| 1:34:32| or at least implementing the beginning of the plans to help get our kids where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5672)|
| 1:34:37| And I think really that's the biggest thing that I want to communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| is that they're doing a great job of planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| and we have to show trust in the system that they have our kids' best interest at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5683)|
| 1:34:50| I hear one person said it to me today that there is a cost to our children of not putting them back in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5690)|
| 1:35:02| and that every parent watches their children kind of melt away and kind of go inside, back in their room and withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5702)|
| 1:35:11| I've heard story after story after story of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| So there is a cost to not going back as well, and we need to take whatever steps we need to take to get them back safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5713)|
| 1:35:22| but try real hard to get them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5724)|
| 1:35:25| I guess what would, if you were to take a general question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| like what would the implementation of IEPs look like for special ed students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5730)|
| 1:35:36| Will there be some options for children that don't learn virtually, can't learn virtually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| Is there going to be a hybrid, partial day, and in-school home options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| So would parents have that up front before the IEP teams are even completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5747)|
| 1:35:57| So make sure we have options for those students who don't learn virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| And as we heard earlier from Jason, that we plan to have an individual plan for every one of our special needs students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5762)|
| 1:36:12| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| Well, that's my idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| That's the spirit of the IEP process, so absolutely we'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| I forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5780)|
| 1:36:21| That's not my language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| Individual education plan, but how would those be implemented in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5783)|
| 1:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Other messages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5793)|
| 1:36:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| I'm going to piggyback on what Jonathan said about communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| Usually in the summers we enjoy our time off from hearing anything from Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| but I think I probably speak for most parents when I say we would love a phone call weekly just saying where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5804)|
| 1:36:51| on what's happening, just any form of communication, email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-200629-community-task-force?start=5811)|
