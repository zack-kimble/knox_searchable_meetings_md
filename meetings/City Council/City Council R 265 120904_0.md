| 0:02:06| we had just two days ago on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| Big crowd despite the rains big crowd showed up and it was the 25th anniversary of Boomsday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| the largest Labor Day firework show in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| And I really want to thank our firefighters, our police officers, our public service employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| all the emergency response people, all the city staff who participated, our special events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| staff and of course Visit Knoxville who sponsors that along with many other sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| So we thank everybody who participated in that and made it such a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| I also want to recognize we have the West Hills Troop 556 that was with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Hope you find the meeting interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| Let's see tomorrow the city of Knoxville will open the Holston River Dog Park at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| at the Holston River Park which is 3300 Holston Hills Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| This is a one acre dog park that was built through PetSafe's $500,000 commitment to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| five dog parks within the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| That is of course Randy Boyd from PetSafe and his company want to make Knoxville the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| most pet friendly community in the country and so they've put their money where their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| mouth is and been helping us build these dog parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| So this is located near the southern most parking lot of Holston River Park and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| new dog park will feature a fenced in area for dogs to safely venture off leash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| It's a great example of a public private partnership and it's in Mayor Brown's district I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=217)|
| 0:03:44| and we appreciate PetSafe participating in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| So come on out tomorrow at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| Also today, some of you may have also done this, I went to a couple of different swearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| in ceremonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| We have some new county officials, a new Judge Sword, Law Director Bud Armstrong, Property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| Assessor Phil Ballard, they were sworn in today and then we went over to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| board and members Doug Harris, Mike McMillan, Karen Carson and India Kincannon, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| all serving another four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| So we congratulate them and we look forward to working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| Let's see, actually next week, I just wanted to let you all know, I've been invited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| participate in the Mayor's Institute on City Design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| This is something that, it's a leadership initiative that's sponsored by the Endowment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| for the Arts along with the American Architectural Foundation and the U.S. Conference of Mayors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| and this has been going on for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| All expenses are paid by the sponsors, which is good, and each mayor, there'll be eight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| mayors that are invited, seven or eight mayors, and they bring in seven or eight city design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| experts and so each mayor is asked to present a particular challenge in your community on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| some kind of a design challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I'm going to talk about the Old City District and some of the plans for revitalizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| and fixing, doing the public infrastructure improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| And so I'll get to present my case and get suggestions from other mayors and other design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| experts and then I'll get to hear their presentations and learn what they're doing in those cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| I believe Mayor Haslam may have participated, I don't know if you had the opportunity when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=330)|
| 0:05:35| you were mayor, Mayor Brown, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| But so I'm looking forward to that and hopefully have a lot of great ideas when I come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| And then when I return, we're going to be holding the second in a series of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| that we're calling the Mayor's Neighborhood Connections on Monday, September 17th at 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=347)|
| 0:05:53| p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| I'll be over in Councilman Della Volpe's district, we'll meet with I and a department head, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| of our city officials, we'll meet with five separate neighborhood organizations at Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| Morris Elementary and these meetings will be similar to the Mayor's Night Out that prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| other mayors have had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| And each of these will really be, we'll design each of these neighborhood connections based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| on the needs of the neighborhoods with whom we are visiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| The neighborhoods that will be participating on the 17th are the Bell Morris Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=382)|
| 0:06:27| Action Group, the Brown Avenue Neighborhood Watch, Edgewood Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| Fairmont Emeryland Neighborhood Association, and the Tacoma Watchdogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| So I invite Council, of course, to come out and anybody that's interested, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| if you live in any of those neighborhoods, we invite you to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| Again, that's Monday, September 17th at 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| And that is all of my, those are all of my announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Any announcements from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| On October 2nd, four weeks from tonight, is the National Night Out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| And that's also the same time that we have the Council meeting scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| So we all like to go to the neighborhoods and we all need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| So with that in mind, I've asked Attorney Frost to prepare an emergency ordinance, bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| to the next meeting that would delay the start of the October meeting from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| This is kind of a heads up for the rest of Council that that's coming forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=450)|

| 0:07:39| And we'll be discussing signed heights at that particular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| So I want to make sure that not only the task force members know, but it is also open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| That'll be tomorrow at 4 at KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=468)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| I just wanted to announce we're having the first Public Properties Naming Committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| on Thursday at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| I believe the deadline is closed for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| But if you ever have in the future, any constituents or anybody in the public wants to rename something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=487)|
| 0:08:15| or name something, contact me or Cindy Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=500)|

| 0:08:23| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| I just wanted to bring everybody's attention to the waterfront and the new JFG sign that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| was lit at Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| It's just a beautiful sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| They did a great job on the restoration of the sign, and it's even in a more prominent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| position now to where it can be seen, I think, from the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Some folks have told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| I haven't seen it firsthand, but I would invite everybody to pay particular attention to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| because it's a real icon that's been gone for two years and is glad to have it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| in its rightful place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=537)|

| 0:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=539)|

| 0:09:05| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| I just wanted to thank your administration and especially Parks and Public Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=547)|
| 0:09:14| They are working on a segment of the Loves Creek Trail that the community cleared probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| seven or eight years ago and flagged it and got it ready and we waited and waited for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=560)|

| 0:13:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| I just had a couple questions for Becky that these two businesses, the stores, they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| be relocated outside the development in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| That's correct. Those parcels were not owned by KCDC. They were privately owned businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=817)|
| 0:13:45| within the footprint of the public housing development. Those will be acquired, the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=825)|
| 0:13:53| relocated, and then those facilities will be torn down, and the goal is not to rebuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=833)|
| 0:13:59| those back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| I have one question in terms of the relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| We just lost you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| How many people will be relocated? Do you have numbers on how many people are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Right at this point, all 183 units, with the exception of maybe two or three, are empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| All those families have been relocated. So I know Mr. Nance is here somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=871)|
| 0:14:37| He's behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| He can give you exact information about relocation, but all the units that are to be demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| at this point will be emptied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Mr. Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Mr. Quirston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Well, the question I had was the numbers of people in terms of the relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| How many people are you actually roughly talking about and relocating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| Out of the 183 units that were demoed when we started the process, 87 were occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Certainly, I'm sure that this is going to be something that's going to be helpful to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| It's going to make the community look better, and the housing stock should go up as time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| goes by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| So I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you for answering the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=933)|
| 0:15:34| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| Could you tell us the share of federal monies versus local monies that's going into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| At this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| I know that you have to go fight for those every year, but what are we doing this year with the one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| whatever it is, $3 million we're looking at here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=952)|
| 0:15:55| Well, what you're looking at here is totally what has happened at this project is that in the first two phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| that were completed, which was the duplex project that was done on an infield, and then the elderly site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| which is the residence at Eastport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Out of those two phases, we brought to the table 90 percent of the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| and we utilized 10 percent of the funds that were provided through the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| through neighborhood stabilization funding for those two projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| This third phase here will end up being a larger portion on the city side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| We're looking at the $3.5 million, of which 2.4, and not counting this 1.3 here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=989)|
| 0:16:37| that is a part of that overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| But in its entirety, we've leveraged more federal funding to the table than we've put in local funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1000)|
| 0:16:49| And do you see belt tightening affecting us as we go forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| Because we're going to be doing this for, what, ten years, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| before we can get the whole area kind of redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| Well, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| But I also would like to point out to councilors that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| one of the sources of funding we're utilizing to replace those housing units is low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| We will continue to pursue that source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Bear in mind that the funding that has been brought to the table today has been funding from some sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1034)|
| 0:17:21| that we've got a very good track record with that is not as dependent upon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| such as low-income housing tax credit and the federal home loan bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| And we're also utilizing housing replacement funds that we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| in return of the demolition of the public housing units we're taking down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| So we do have a funding source that are being generated, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| that gives us a real good feel that, yes, we can deliver on what we're promising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| But, again, if you're looking at whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| or not there's going to be a huge amount of public federal assistance for production,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1069)|
| 0:17:55| we're not seeing that in the existing budget, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| I appreciate what you do, and I know we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| I'm just curious how it was breaking down in this current time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1083)|

| 0:18:25| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| I just had one question about this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Is it normal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Is it usual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Is it customary that we spend money for operating for funds for CHOTOs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1112)|
| 0:18:38| Typically, we have done it for capacity building at the start of a CHOTO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1118)|
| 0:18:44| a community housing development organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Knox Housing Partnership has received these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| Tennessee Housing has received these funds, and Neighborhood Housing has also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| Now, those organizations are well underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| They develop housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| They don't need our operating money anymore because they support themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| But CAN is a new organization that's a subsidiary of CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| They've been underway for a little while, but they haven't done any housing development yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| They're just getting started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| So this $30,000 will help pay staff for those initial startups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1157)|
| 0:19:23| And it is an eligible use of home funds to provide capacity building operating funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1163)|
| 0:19:32| Do you feel like it gives you an advantage to have an additional CHOTO?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Is that the reason you'd be supported?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| I mean, you know, there's definitely a need for all the affordable housing that we can have in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| And different CHOTOs do it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| They build in different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| They have a different client base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| And so we like to support them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| And CHOTOs are community housing development organizations, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| It's a federal designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1208)|

| 0:20:22| believed to be owned by Victor Vandergriff at an estimate cost of $12,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1222)|

| 0:20:33| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| Well, this one says believed to be owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And should we not be able to find Mr. Vandergriff or the owner of the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Just explain what happens to the money and what happens to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| If we have to take the property by eminent domain, condemnation if necessary is what it says on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1248)|
| 0:20:56| The funds, the appraised value, will be deposited in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| That's the way this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Then all the taxes will be paid out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| If there are any proceeds left, then the heirs, once those are determined, will get the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| But, you know, if possible, we try to negotiate sale with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| And that believed to be is a term we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| That is the owner of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1285)|

| 0:21:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Oh, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| I want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| In our packet, there are some properties that seem to be also affected by the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Do you anticipate some more of these properties having to be acquired in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Brent Johnson, engineering planning chief for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| There are six properties there total that we're trying to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| A study was done by Folger McIndoe as part of the MLK Williams Creek project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| and there were six properties identified whereby we could not reduce the flood profile below the 100-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| below the finished floor level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| Therefore, we are going to acquire all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Four of them have been acquired, or this will be the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Two have been made offers, but they have not accepted at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| So once that's those properties, that would probably be you won't have to acquire any more other than those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| You don't anticipate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| We do not anticipate that for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1375)|

| 0:23:18| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| Yes, I was just wondering if Ann Wallace could come down and tell us a little bit about how this project started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| the history, and the timeline moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Good evening, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Ann Wallace, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| I work in the Department of Policy and Redevelopment in the Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| and I'd also like to ask John Hunter to join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| We're co-leading this project as we move into the next phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Where we started with the wayfinding was it came out of an initiative that was supported by the nine counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| one vision process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| From there, the city worked with the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and was able to secure funding to go ahead and leverage a consultant to do a wayfinding study for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| Merge Design out of Philadelphia was selected in a very competitive bid process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| and we were also pleased that KTSC donated $15,000 to that process to be able to get a good downtown wayfinding system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1451)|
| 0:24:20| What we've noted is that there are several other competitive cities, such as Greenville and Asheville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| who have already established a downtown wayfinding program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| and that's been very successful, and they have found that that actually helps to retain visitors longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| and that visitors will actually go and explore more places because they're well-known and well-directed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| One of the things that we heard in our extensive public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| starting in 2008 and wrapping up in late 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| was that there's a lot of downtown parking that's available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| but not everybody recognizes where those resources are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| and especially if you get in a situation where one garage that you're familiar with is full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| being able to sign to the next garage and direct folks to that next garage is going to be very critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| to making sure that both residents and visitors enjoy their experience in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| That being said, I'll ask John to give you a quick update on where we're headed with our TDOT grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| that was recently approved, well, last year was approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| John Hunter, Chief Traffic Engineer for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| Moving forward with timeline, if we get the consultant on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| we think that by middle of 2014, we can actually start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| We have to follow the local program's guidelines, which is TDOT requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| The consultant, if they're allowed to move forward concurrently with some items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| we could get to construction by the end of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| There are several things that are up in the air as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| because we have to follow the TDOT federal guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1560)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you. Councilman Dall-Lupe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| Thank you, Mayor. As long as I've got John there, I don't see Mr. Hagerman here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| He's out of town, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| I think I know the answer to this, but it still troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Why does it cost us $300,000 to figure out where we're going to put some signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| I mean, I'm picturing three guys in a pickup truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| One guy's got a drill in the concrete. The other one holds the post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| The third guy pours the epoxy in, and you screw the sign on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| This is the work leading up to the sign installation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| and it's got design work, it's got environmental work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| it's got all kinds of technical studies, but it almost seems too complex for what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| I mean, don't we know where to turn? I mean, that's kind of the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| The quick answer is we have to follow the federal guidelines to use the federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| which requires that we go through the NEPA process, National Environmental Policy Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Are any endangered things on those sidewalks where you're going to put the signs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| No, but we've got to look and make sure that we are not invading on the vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1624)|
| 0:27:10| causing any visual impacts to historical properties, those type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1630)|
| 0:27:18| And roughly $25,000, $30,000 of this is going to be towards that environmental documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1638)|
| 0:27:26| There's almost $200,000 of this that is actually the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| $194,000 at the end there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Correct. Construction engineering inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| That's during the construction phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| having somebody out documenting all the work that's taking place as those signs are going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| This is the guy in the Chevy following the truck with the three guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Okay, you know, I know lawyers for years have passed laws and made money doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1666)|
| 0:27:51| Now the engineers have caught up, I guess, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| We'll start by blaming your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| I just had one question about – now, just make sure that I understand what we're approving tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| You're asking for $297,000, $240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| Explain the breakdown of the money and what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| What's our net expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| What you're talking about tonight is the $297,000, $297,000, $485,000, and 97 cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1700)|
| 0:28:32| The breakdown of that is 20 percent of that is local funds, 80 percent of that is federal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| I just wanted to ask you, if we get started in 2014, how long do you anticipate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| if everything goes well after that, how long would it take to complete the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| Anticipate the full construction being done within one year, so the middle of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1732)|
| 0:28:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Item 11G is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute all documents on behalf of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| to lease certain public rights-of-way to Knoxville's Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Since we have Becky here still, I noticed that Walter P. Taylor wasn't on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| Maybe that's because we're changing its nature, but is there a separate lease for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| or what are we doing on the list of leases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| I'll ask Mr. Nance to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Let me answer that one, Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| Currently, the lease has not expired on Walter P. Taylor's site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| These leases have all expired, and that's why they're being renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| They're coming up in terms of their renewal dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| I want to ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Austin Homes is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| And in the future, there's just a few buildings left there at Austin Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| What are we planning to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Planning to just leave those or what's the future there with Austin Homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| Well, now, long term, Councilman Brown, you know, we have been working to try to market that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| It's a 20-acre site that's next to the warehouse district there right off of Bell Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| Long term, we would like to look at replacing those 124 units that still remain in that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| with some better housing than exists on that particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| We do not foresee long term that we will rebuild on this site with affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| 11H is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to enter into an agreement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Arnstein Partners LLC to provide a $250,000 deferred payment forgivable loan of Urban Development Action Grant Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| income funds to construct tenant finish improvements to certain premises that will be leased by Urban Outfitters within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| building located at 505 Market Street for use as a retail store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| I guess Jim York is here, and I suppose Dr. Lyons is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| I asked this when we were talking about the budget type issue probably two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| Again, looking at the actual documents here for the forgivable loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| is there any reason why we're not charging 3 or 4 percent interest on the declining balance so that we raise some money that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1889)|
| 0:31:36| put in a pot and can then secure the next business to come downtown rather than running out of money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| In other words, we have a default interest rate if they don't stay there five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| Why don't we charge interest on the declining balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| Typically in a deferred payment loan of this sort, it is interest free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| and we have structured it similar to previous loans that we've done through community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1923)|
| 0:32:14| It would be a pretty nice loan at 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| This is like we're following history, not money investment practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| That's kind of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| Well, again, this is a totally forgivable loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Like I said, we're forgiving the principal as we go 20 percent each year for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| And the purpose is to promote development, you know, in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| It's basically a grant, but it's, you know, you do it over five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| so if they don't fulfill certain obligations, then they pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| But it serves similar to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| It becomes a grant in essence after five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Well, and, like, again, I've already beat this to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| The grant could be the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| We could, in fact, earn some money while we were going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| and it would be a great loan to them and a little return for the taxpayers, but we're not doing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| Dr. Lyons, I just had a question about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| What happens if Urban Outfitters leaves in two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| I mean, it says specifically for Urban Outfitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| That means that that portion would not be forgiven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| In other words, this is contingent upon them staying the five years is what the outcome is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| So it's specifically for Urban Outfitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| Which is going to be a real boon for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| That's really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Well, I do think I'm going to expound on that a little bit because this is all new information from our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| a lot more in detail, and I think it's real important to know that it is just for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| and they stay five years, they don't stay five years, even if they put another tenant in, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| I mean, and there's other ways to default on this that protects the city and protects our investment in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| and I think it's important to go over that and make sure that people know that it's something we really support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2042)|
| 0:34:09| but it's got some strings attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| I think those are good points, and I think that we, in all our messaging, should make sure to stress that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| 11A is a resolution approving the amendment and restatement of the City of Knoxville's A-Series 6L1 loan agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| with the Public Building Authority of Sevier County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| and B-Series A4A loan agreement with the Public Building Authority of Blount County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| directing the conversion of the interest rate on the related local government public improvement bond series 6L1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| and local government public improvement bond series A4A to an index rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| and authorizing the execution and delivery of index rate agreements in connection therewith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Well, I'd like to amend the motion to postpone it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| and give us enough time to study the refinance of some $80 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| Just give us a little bit more time to kind of go over it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| We have a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| Is there discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Yes, I'd like to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| On the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Maybe Jim York can tell us if we're facing an expiration or something that would affect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2131)|
| 0:35:37| As I understand this loan refinancing from discussions with Jim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| that we are looking at trying to do this in the way we think will reduce the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| and market risks that we're currently experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| So, Jim, is there a time frame for when we can renew these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| We have currently entered into a renewal of the existing LOC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| our standby purchase agreement with the bank, and we can continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| So two weeks is not going to jeopardize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Is it fair to say that what you're trying to do here is save the city money as you go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| in refinancing existing debt for the convention center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| and possibly other facilities that we've already borrowed money to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Our purpose here is to restructure the debt to save money where we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| This is not primarily done for savings like a pure refinancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| but it's a restructuring that is necessitated by the ending of a current agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| with a standby letter of credit facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2211)|
| 0:36:56| And what we're hoping to do is by doing this restructuring that we can take certain risk off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2216)|
| 0:37:02| and that will still enable us to save funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| or save money by using a variable rate debt structure rather than a fixed rate structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2225)|
| 0:37:11| And is it fair to say that internal to this plan that you have here, you reserve the right to refinance it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2231)|
| 0:37:19| In other words, the borrower can call or something to take a position that would enable it to refinance it again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| if it wasn't to its financial advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| So the city could save money in the future if there were some better terms out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| The city has the opportunity to repay the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| What happens under this restructuring is that the lenders, in this case a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| forego the right to demand payment for a period of five years on the A4As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2265)|
| 0:37:55| and for seven years or to the end of the term on the 6L1 series.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| What are we going to learn in two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| I mean, his memo here is fairly explicit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| and I'm sure he's willing to answer whatever concerns we may have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| But I thought this was well explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| I didn't mean to say it wasn't well explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| I think that from talking with Mr. York earlier today, it's not something that has to be voted on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2305)|
| 0:38:33| I think it's really a decision of whether you think or we think that on the $60 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2313)|
| 0:38:42| whether we want to go a fixed rate or a variable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| And, I mean, I have history in O&O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| and I just think it would give me some time to think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| and really talk to some people who really know more about bonds than I do about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| and it might change my opinion how I might vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| So I'd just like to have – it's not an urgent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| and I'd just like to have a couple more weeks to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| It is pretty complicated, and bond financing is not my forte,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| but it's something I have a general understanding about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| and I'd just like to get a little more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Well, let me respond very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| I probably will not vote for an extension right now, but if it passes, I'm very comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| We have a motion and a second to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2371)|

| 0:39:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| Let's do a roll call on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2379)|
| 0:39:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| The postponement passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| So we will put that back on the agenda for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| Mayor, are we going to have a workshop or something on this if we're going to study it closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| or are we just going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| I think just on self-study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Self-study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Self-study for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| And Mr. York would be glad to meet with any of you individually to further discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| Mayor, could I ask you a question about that, or you or Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| Would this have any effect on the city's bond rating at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| This action should have no impact on the city's bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| We're on 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| 11J is a resolution authorizing the mayor to sign a memorandum of understanding with Knox County to accept $23,250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| as a subrecipient of the 2011 Homeland Security Grant in order to purchase an entry-link HAZMAT video camera for the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| 11K is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute change order number two to contract number C-12-155| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2469)|

| 0:41:17| for additional work regarding the multipurpose room addition to Lonsdale Recreation Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| so as to increase the contract amount by $29,672.90 for a new contract price of $533,372.90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2482)|
| 0:41:35| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Councilman Dela Vokey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Yeah, is Joe Walsh here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| Yeah, Joe is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| Joe, I'm a little confused as you walk up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| To me, I thought we finished this recreation center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| but we're now amending the contract sort of to go back, I guess, and pay the guy for something he's already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| That's what it looks like to me, and I guess if that's true, my question becomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| why isn't a change order required before the work is done in the normal course of doing things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| Joe Walsh, Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| You're correct, Councilman, and basically this is an administration error on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| They had requested the change earlier, and, frankly, the person in my office who handles that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| she's been on extended medical leave for several weeks, so it sat on her desk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| and didn't get processed in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| But, yeah, this was just a couple of minor changes in the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| and I authorized the contract to proceed to get the work completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| But ordinarily you would require the change order first when you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Joe, were these just unforeseen contingencies, like things that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| underestimates of the cost, or in detail, what is the extra money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| There was a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| One, as we were digging the foundation, something called push piers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| as they were digging to the ground, they had to do some exploratory digging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| to determine how many piers they'd have to insert into the ground to stabilize the foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| and there were more than we had originally anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| So we had expected there might be an increase, and that was part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| The other part was, while they were in there working on the facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| we decided to have them go ahead and replace the existing floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| and the gymnasium on the old section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| And we found some additional funding in our operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| we decided to transfer over to use for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| And would you confirm it had nothing to do when I took the sledgehammer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| Did you drop it too hard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| That's unconfirmed to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| 11L is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| with Mays Bus Lines Inc. to provide transportation services to participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| in various programs sponsored by the City of Knoxville Parks and Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| for a total contract amount not to exceed $34,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| 11M is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| to accept a grant award of $194,604| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| with a required 20% local match of $48,651| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| to conduct a highly visible and comprehensive commercial motor vehicle traffic enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| and safety inspection program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Councilman Dallaropi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Chief Roush is here, and I guess I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Some states have an actual inspection requirement for all vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| before they get their renewal each year to get on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| This looks like it's for commercial, but will we have a center or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| where trucks come in and we test the brakes and the lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| and all the safety features that it has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| What we use is we have officers that are assigned to do enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| on the interstate with commercial vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| and then they also assist the Department of Transportation at the way stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2707)|
| 0:45:13| during special enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| So when you drive through Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| you can be stopped and asked to show your safety stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2721)|
| 0:45:22| And if you don't, you get what, a ticket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| They will cite and possibly even impound a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| if it doesn't meet the federal and state standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| And how do they know that as they're driving down the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| and they get to Knoxville that they should have it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Well, they're required at all times to meet the guidelines as they travel on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| These are federal guidelines, so it applies across the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| and, if awarded, accept a grant award from Bloomberg Philanthropies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| in the potential range of $1 million to $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| and which requires no local match from the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| to find and spread innovative local solutions to national problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| regarding regulations for crematory, columbariums, and funeral establishments, all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2783)|
| 0:46:32| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| As you know, we had a workshop last week on this very issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| and we had a good two-hour workshop on it, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| And we want to or I would like to make the motion that we send it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2804)|
| 0:46:50| and then I'll turn it over to Attorney Frost to let him outline what will be going back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2810)|
| 0:46:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| And I'll postpone it until October the 16th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| Is that sufficient time for them to get back to us, the 16th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| If we send it back, I would assume it would be on the September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Let me rethink this then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| The date will change, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2839)|
| 0:47:23| Mark Donaldson, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| The earliest that we could get it on an MPC agenda would be for our October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| It will be the second Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| and then we normally take things back to Council the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| So you would see it in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| So we would be looking at actually about a 90-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| The second meeting of November would probably be the better day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| Mr. Frost, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| Or 60 days, rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| Former Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| Briefly, if I could, let me confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| You could postpone it to the specific date of November 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| And I'll amend or just make that motion to November 3rd instead of October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2887)|
| 0:48:16| I'm going to call Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Vice Mayor Pavlis, I'd respectfully suggest, since we're sending it back to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| we're just referring it back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| If we postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| Not postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| We don't need to postpone it because we postponed what's in front of us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| So the effect of us sending it back is they won't be able to consider it until their October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| so it won't be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I mean, the effect is the same, but without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| Will they just bring it back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| So the correct motion is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| To send it back to MPC for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=2932)|

| 0:57:46| They had to clean it up in the beginning of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Why is it now no violation when it's a whole lot worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| Photo number 198, July 6, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| The fat male over there trespassed and vandalized my yard with his weeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| It was reported to David Brace that evening, and he contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Apparently, they were told to stay out of my yard, but that doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| And number 199, dated the same day, shows this guy leaving my yard at approximately 4.30 PM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3492)|

| 0:58:30| This is how big that pile is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| They threw it in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3512)|

| 0:58:44| She leaned over the fence to kill weeds, and most of what is dead in that picture is in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| And that's since Brace told them to stay out of my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| So I think if they don't step on it, they're not in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| But leaning over it is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Number 2010, dated August 23, 2012, is the remainder of what she killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3538)|

| 0:59:14| It was reported to codes on July 25, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| The code report of August 17, 2012, says no violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| And that's the one that was a violation in early 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| Codes number 26289, which was reported, this was outside of the photographs, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3569)|

| 0:59:42| It was inspected on July 26, 2012, and they claim no violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| There's a two-car garage on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| That's where it needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3589)|

| 0:59:59| A previous violation was already reported to Mayor O'Hara on this same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| The guy is flipping cars, and he puts them on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| He puts sale signs on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| He has the car parked in the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| There's a violation of two different laws there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| He just got done with another vehicle, and that's what was reported to Codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| because they couldn't get anybody to listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| And all they were told was move the car once it sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| They just gave their sign of approval to leave the car in the yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| with the signs in the yard and on the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| And the ordinance is very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| It says to put the car in a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| That's not where it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3642)|

| 1:00:49| There's been a lot of talk about cleaning up blight, but no talk about preventing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| If Codes did its job, there would be no blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| Every ordinance violation must have a fine attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| For all subsequent violations of the same ordinance, same property, the fine must double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| Good old boys protecting violations must stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3665)|

| 1:01:11| divide it equally among your departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| And you'll have no new taxes that would be needed to run those departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| Money talks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120904?start=3677)|
