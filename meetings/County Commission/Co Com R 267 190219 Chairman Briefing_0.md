| 0:00:30| Hey friends, I don't have a gavel, but I'm going to go ahead and call this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| Chris, are you bringing, what are we, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=37)|
| 0:00:44| Before we really begin the meeting, I just want to thank everybody for being here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=44)|
| 0:00:49| and let you know I've been trying to pull this together for about five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| I thought that when you take a look at our balance sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| and you'll take a look at the mission that we as commissioners are tasked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=58)|
| 0:01:01| in terms of putting together our budget and being good fiscal stewards for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=61)|
| 0:01:07| this struck me as a very well-timed opportunity to have a workshop focused really on our balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=67)|
| 0:01:14| We've got a new mayor, we've got a lot of new commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=74)|
| 0:01:18| we've got a lot of new folks over at the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| This just struck me as a good time, not just for us, but for the public in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| to have an opportunity for us to discuss our balance sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=86)|
| 0:01:30| I believe CTV is actually recording this session as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| so that all of our documents that are handed out in this meeting will become public documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| and it will just be, frankly, really good for everybody in the community to kind of know exactly where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| So with that said, I want to thank Mr. Caldwell for helping pull together this session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=104)|
| 0:01:52| and I'm going to go ahead and kick it off to Chris to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| At any time, if you have questions, we've got a couple of folks from public financial management here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| to help present some of this data that they've handed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| And because of sickness, two of our commissioners are missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=122)|
| 0:02:06| so we're not going to be taking the new pitchers for commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| So we can really take this up to about probably 4.50, 4.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| So we've got plenty of time if you have plenty of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| So go ahead, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| I won't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| I just want to introduce Lauren and Nick from PFM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| They'll take turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| They'll go through the debt capacity analysis first and then credit analysis and benchmarking studies second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| They'll tell you to stop them if you have questions as they go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| There are no bad questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| We went through it once already with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| And so just feel free to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| We're going to try to get a cord down here to get that projected up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| But everything that you have in front of you is what they'll be going over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| and they'll reference page numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| So anytime that you have questions, just feel free to stop them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| And I will first turn it over to Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=175)|
| 0:03:05| Can everybody hear me all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Not really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Does this work better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| I'll try to yell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| As Chris mentioned, we prepared this debt capacity analysis for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| Starting out on page two, we give a brief overview of kind of the approach that we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| in looking at the debt capacity of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| We take a two-prong approach to looking at debt capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| and that's the county's ability to issue additional debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| We look at the existing resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| which are mainly the general fund and the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=223)|
| 0:03:46| That's where all of the property tax dollars that come into the county go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=226)|
| 0:03:52| And so the two different areas that we are looking at are affordability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| and credit capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| So how much debt is the county able to afford based on its existing resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| And then also how much debt could the county issue before it starts to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| negatively impact the county's current credit rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=249)|
| 0:04:16| Flipping to slide three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| we have a general overview of the current outstanding debt of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| These are general obligation bonds that are backed by the property taxes of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| You can see the general obligation bonds here at the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| That's $619 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Down there at the bottom we have loans, capital leases included as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Are we doing them this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Do you have this book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| They have a whole bunch of copies here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| It's probably the same in ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| This is in color, so it just might be a little bit easier to follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| On the top where it says synthetic fixed and variable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| what are the differences in synthetic fixed and variable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| I don't know what fixed is, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| The synthetic fixed bonds, they were issued as variable rate bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| and then there was an interest rate swap performed on those bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| to fix the cost at a certified fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| The variable rate bonds are just purely variable rate bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| There's no swap associated with that debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| As you can see down there, under July 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| those were the 2018 general obligation bonds that PFM worked with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| on issuing, and those bonds were closed last July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| That's why they're kind of broken out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| because that was after the June 30 fiscal year end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| Can I ask you a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| If I could ask a quick question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| This slide breaks it down and shows the total bonds, loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| and capital lease obligations of $689 million and a half, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| But that is essentially only the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=360)|
| 0:06:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| That is the outstanding principal balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| So what is the total liability, principal interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| over the next 15-plus years when it comes to essentially what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| When you talk about for the general world, you relate it to a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| You might owe $200,000 on your house, but by the time you're done paying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| you're not going to have paid $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| My back-of-the-napkin calculation shows that it's probably more like a billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| dollars in debt or more when it comes to total liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| Yeah, we don't have that in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| We do have a slide that shows your total debt service payments per fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| I don't know if that may be more with what you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| That would kind of show you your, quote-unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| mortgage-style payment per year going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| I don't know if that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| Well, I think it's helpful for the – instead of saying we have $689 million in debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| I think it's helpful for the public to understand we probably have a billion dollars in debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| and that really let's look at the true full cost of our debt, not just the snapshot in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| because even if you had $689 million right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| you couldn't pay that off because of the way the debts are termed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| So I think it's – I just think at some point it's appropriate to let the public know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| what our real true debt cost is, not just our snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=440)|
| 0:07:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| They can always find that in the annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| If you all don't mind, I wanted to recognize Ms. Hill, our chair of our school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| who came all the way from Nashville to be part of this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| I invited her, and I knew that she was spending time in Nashville this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| advocating at the Capitol for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| I might also ask if we have any extra copies of the presentation materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| if we could make sure that Terry receives a copy of the deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| You're welcome to, if you want, sit up here at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Terry, do you want to come up here and sit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Commissioner Jay, that can always be found in our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| So the interest amount on the 619, which is presented there, would be 235.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=485)|
| 0:08:15| And so there would be an additional amount for the 33 that was issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| and there's a smaller piece on the loans and capital leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Those are at a lower rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| So it probably comes out close to $300 million of additional obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| Yeah, I think it's about $850, $860 total, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| I have a question for you, I guess, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| On the capital lease, I know one of them is the train contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| and the other is the solar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| and they are supposed to be cost neutral by savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| Have we ever got any reports that indicate if these are actually becoming cost neutral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| Yeah, all of our train ones are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=535)|
| 0:09:13| What Melanie was saying was the two train ones, that's our reference there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| if they don't meet the savings to pay for those amounts, then they cut us a check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| and they've cut us a check for two smaller pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| So those have been cost neutral and actually have probably to the positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| And then the solar lease we actually just started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| we entered into an agreement in the last six months to finalize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| The revenue received from the solar leases was revenue before we had signed into the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=582)|
| 0:09:49| So those will be positive, but it's actually just now starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=589)|
| 0:09:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| I have one more question for, I'm sorry, your name, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| Nick, yeah, Sula with PFL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=600)|
| 0:10:03| I'll just stick with Nick instead of mispronouncing the last name too many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| No, that's fine, I completely understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Sticking with page three on the debt overview, what about a debt should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| in your professional opinion, what about a debt should be in a variable rate versus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| is there some sort of standardized, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| you feel like a portfolio ought to have no more than 20 percent of variables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| or I mean is there sort of a professional opinion about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Do you want me to answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I mean I think your reference to 20 is actually quite good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| We do see a lot of 80-20 splits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Also looking at the amount of variable rate debt you have in comparison to your fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=641)|
| 0:10:48| is another good way to think about it because if you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| your fund balance is invested short term, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| so the interest rates are variable much like your short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| your variable rate debt that you have in your debt profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Any other questions on slide three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| Sorry, those are all good questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| and we can obviously consider updating that as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=670)|
| 0:11:17| Switching to page four, this just gives you a breakdown of the 619,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=677)|
| 0:11:25| the principal payment, the principal pay down throughout the life of the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| That's based on taking on no more debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Yes, that is the current principal reduction of your outstanding debt with no additional debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=694)|
| 0:11:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| How many counties actually do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| McMahon County is the only debt-free county in the state, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| We will get to some future proposed debt issuances in some of the later slides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| and so right now we're just trying to give you an overview of where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| As you can see, in 10 years the county is going to pay down approximately 59% of their outstanding principal balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=722)|
| 0:12:11| The most recent Moody's rating report that we had, they considered that to be right around a below average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=731)|
| 0:12:21| I have a question with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| I saw about six of these slides that show this sort of pay down reduction debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| That's a forecast of essentially no action by three to five additional administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| with very little sort of a fixed capital cost of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| I mean, it's a crystal ball like I've never seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| It assumes that nothing will ever change, nothing price will ever go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| no future administration will ever make any big choices beyond what's being done right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| I mean, it doesn't seem like a good tool to forecast because how would you know what's going to happen in 2026?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=779)|
| 0:13:07| For the existing debt pay down, I mean, like I said, this is just kind of showing you a snapshot of where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=787)|
| 0:13:14| If you looked over back on page three where we have all of these fixed interest rate costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| so that's assuming that all those bonds are going to be paid down as structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| which most of them probably have a ten-year call where we could refinance them if we wanted to for a lower savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| if there's a possibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| The county also budgets quite conservatively on interest rate costs as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| so for the variable rate portions of that debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| that just kind of assumes that that conservative interest rate assumption is carried forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| You're right, I mean, we can't predict what is going to happen in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| and that's not really what the slide is trying to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| It's just trying to show you where we're at right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Here's how your current debt is going to be repaid over the life of what's outstanding currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| This is all we're really trying to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| So then in the slide five, part of our analysis was we wanted to take a look to see if there was any of the outstanding debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=847)|
| 0:14:16| that could be refinanced for savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| As I mentioned, some of these bonds have ten-year call dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| which we're coming up on for the 2010A and 2010B Build America bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| The 2010C bonds do have a current call date of June 1, 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| Typically, as part of an overview of a county's debt profile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| we want to look at is there any ways that you can save money by refinancing this debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| Obviously, in 2015, 2016, and 2017, there were historic low interest rate environments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| and so we saw a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| As we discussed earlier with the mayor, most of those refundings have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| I believe that the most recent one was done at the end of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| The 2017B bonds were refunding bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Do you see any change in that law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| For the tax-exempt refunding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| Any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| I will say one can speculate what the federal government will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| However, they really have no incentive to undo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Their mission was accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| What was their incentive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| They shrunk the tax-exempt market, in theory, to push investors to taxable investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=931)|
| 0:15:37| where they get taxes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| They shrunk the market by about 30% that quick, and it worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| The only thing I could see coming out of it would be, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| the way they refer to an advance refunding is anything 90 days and before that call date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| that refinance date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| It would be a very quick and easy modification to change it from 90 days to 180 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| or 360, or some other number that gave a local government a longer window of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| or a bigger window of time to refinance debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| I think that's the only thing we can hope for at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| but there's real no incentive for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Their position was, well, many local governments did all their refinancings in 2014, 2015, and 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=980)|
| 0:16:26| so they should be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Okay, so they did take into consideration the plans that local governments might have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| in the future, refinance some of those variable rates instead of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| Is that too bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Yeah, pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| I do think that's probably our only hope for, at least in the near term for a revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1000)|
| 0:16:45| would be changing that window of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| which does give a local government a longer window or a wider window to refinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| and to be more nimble if interest rates are in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| I have another question on this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| How do you refinance loans that have a negative balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| I don't understand how you could have the B's, the A and the D series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| that has essentially a negative balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| You can't refinance something at a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Help me understand how this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We would not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| We would not recommend those refinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| We're just simply reporting it as some of the candidates that we had looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| As you can see in that PV savings column, it would be negative $494,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| We would not recommend that at this current time because the interest rates are not in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| I'm just wondering why it's on the slide that says opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Because that is an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| So that amount could change, but as of now it's a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| What they're showing is all the vehicles that you could refund in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| Oh, it has the structural ability to be refunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| None of these actually make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Just want to make sure I'm clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| And as we did kind of note over there on the far right column, that call date of June 1, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| I think that's the other reason it's included is that as you go forward and you get closer to June 1 next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| that may start to come more into the money and actually look a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| So just kind of something to keep an eye out as we go forward within that 90-day window of June 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1100)|
| 0:18:28| I guess I do have a question on that since he asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| I guess I do have a question on that since he asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| What kind of interest rate sensitivity would turn that negative into a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| and put us into the window to which to refinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| There's a few things on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| Let me focus on the Build America bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| So those were issued as taxable debt and that you get an interest rate subsidy from the federal government of 35%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| That was during the American Recovery Act in 2009 and 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| In 2013, when the federal government saw their own budget pressures, they started reducing that subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1142)|
| 0:19:11| Even though they promised it to you for 20 to 30 years, all local governments, they started reducing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| It was in the form of their budget sequestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| At its peak, which was in 2013, it was, we think, around 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1160)|
| 0:19:25| So 8% of your 35% didn't come to you even though you promised it in 2009 and 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| And then each year, as they have sort of, I think, gotten a better hold of their own budgetary issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| but there is still that sequestration rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| So right now, I think it's at 6.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| So those factors come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| I will say many local governments, once they get to this call date, if they can break even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| meaning they can actually take that debt, convert it to tax-exempt rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| because these were tax-exempt projects that the county did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| They will often do that just to eliminate that risk of the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1195)|
| 0:20:00| We don't know what that sequestration rate is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| It's certainly trending more favorably, but we all went into this type of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| assuming we got 35% of the subsidy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| So that's actually a component of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| I think if nothing happened in the market and we got to 2020, you could refinance this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| and it would actually make sense, and it would be in the green versus the red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| And you would eliminate that concern or that risk of the interest rate subsidy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| whether or not it comes in at 35% or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| And at this point, it's been less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Is that helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Is the interest rate the only variable that may change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| or is it also how much you're paying off on it, or is it a combination of the two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| It's both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| Moving to slide six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| As we were projecting out balances in the debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| we wanted to take into consideration, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| some future bond issuances that the county has already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| That was in the FY19 capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| We have those bond issues listed here below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| We've assumed that there is one issued per fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Obviously, if the county wanted to to kind of conserve costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| they could lump these up into one bond issue for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| cover two years of projects if that was how they decided to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| And then we just gave some of our assumptions on that future debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| We assumed that they were issued with a level debt service over a 20-year amortization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| and we assumed a 5% rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| Can I make a statement here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| It's really not geared toward you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| It's toward the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| If you look at the school project, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| the school system was in an MOU with the county and kind of limited their capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| You know, this 12, 7, 10, 10, and 10, that barely covers the maintenance capital that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| And so if you're talking about a school or three schools, that's not figured in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| and you're probably looking at another $60 million to $80 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| on top of all the calculations they've been given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| And they were dealing with what they had to deal with, and I get it because it's been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| but there's going to be a lot more debt load on this just based on the need for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| or three more elementary schools in the next five, seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| I have a question, and I guess I'm going back because you've already flipped the page on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| We had issued, I think it was, $60 million in bearable rate bonds to do a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1356)|
| 0:22:42| that I think will hit us in 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| What kind of impact is that going to make, and is there an opportunity to convert those now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1365)|
| 0:22:55| Yeah, I mean, we haven't looked at any refinancing of the variable rate debt at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| I will say that it would probably not make sense from a monetary savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| I'm sorry, I said variable rate. I meant to say interest only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1388)|
| 0:23:17| So, first of all, it's been factored into all of the debt profile here that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| The pay down is reflective of that, so it's an aggregate portfolio view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| So if you were to refinance that debt into, and I presume your question is more related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| paying off more principal than interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| So we're going to go from a small debt service on that issue to a very large debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| And so the county is planning for that, so that's factored into their debt profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| So it hits you at a point where other debt is also falling off, so it works out fine in terms of cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1425)|
| 0:23:52| and being able to manage through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| Obviously, if you did something to refinance that and push more principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| it would cost more on the short term, but on the long term, you technically would save an interest cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| because you'd pay more towards principal and less towards interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| But you would lose all that interest you paid up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| But it would be more manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| Right. Certainly, it would be a piece of your debt that you'd save cost just because of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| but it would cause an uptick in your annual debt service because you're now paying more principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| I have a question related to slide 6 on the sort of proposed debt and the estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| Two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| You have an interest rate of 5 percent, but things are closer to 3 percent right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| So why sort of so conservative on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Johnson City was poor last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I'll give a frame of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| We priced Johnson City last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| I just feel like it's a good frame of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| They aren't as strong as the county's credit, meaning it's one notch off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| and their rate was right at a 4 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Okay. So even if at a 4, you're still overestimating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| and our credit rating is lower and our cost is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| It just seems a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| For a five-year period, in my professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| if you're making decisions based on an interest rate movement in terms of affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| the projects really should, you'll have to take a step back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Five percent for planning purposes is what we see a lot of counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| very well-managed like yourself, do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Recognizing that if it comes in better than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| that actually means there's more resources towards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| because there's usually more pent-up capital needs than not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| Yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| My other question is just, I know tax law only allows for sort of the useful life of the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| It's called 100 different ways, but essentially you can only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| if a school is supposed to last for 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| you can't finance it for 50 or 100 or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| But a lot of these assets that are being talked about are sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1555)|
| 0:26:02| I think they're more than 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| What was the methodology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| How did you pick 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| I mean, could it be 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Could it be 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| The way we don't build and maintain things in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| sometimes that's a 50- or 60-year life span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| So how did you come up with 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| That seems, again, a little bit optimistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| 20 years seems to be kind of a market standard for a general obligation bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I mean, I understand your point about useful lives and kind of matching up projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| I don't believe that we had a detailed listing of each of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| And so, like, again, that was just kind of. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| Okay, so it's sort of a norm standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Yeah, it is a very normal standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| And I believe pretty much all of the recent general obligation bond issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| that the county has issued are all 20-year debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| 20-year terms with level debt service up to the 2018 bond issue that we worked on this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1606)|
| 0:26:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| There's a certain amount of conformity needed amongst all to go to market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1617)|
| 0:27:02| And it's like a 15-year mortgage or a 30-year mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| It's just what is easily packaged and sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Slide 7 just shows, as we had talked about, kind of that what is your total cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1635)|
| 0:27:22| And we obviously don't have the total number here of the interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:25| but we do show here is your total existing and proposed debt service payments on a per-year basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| And so, as you can see, the colored bars, we've added in those additional bond issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| proposed bond issues in 19 through 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| And you can see that drop-off in 34 from some of the variable rate debt being paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1664)|
| 0:27:50| And, again, this is just kind of a snapshot of where we're at right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| plus trying to add in what we know has been approved for future borrowing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1673)|
| 0:28:04| Commissioner Smith, if I may, just so you know, on page 7, you'll see the decrease from 34 to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| That's when the $69 million issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1692)|
| 0:28:17| And that starts to be paid off in 2027.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1697)|
| 0:28:25| So moving to slide 8, this is where we start talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| what are your existing resources to borrow or increase the debt capacity of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| The first one we took a look at was the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| and we basically look at this through the historical financials of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| We go through it line by line with projections for each revenue and expenditure item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| Those were the growth rates over here on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| Those were in conjunction with Chris and Melanie looking at what are the projected increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| that they see for revenues and expenditures going forward from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| If I might jump in here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| When I was preparing for this meeting, I went through almost all of your decks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and all the information Chris provided us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| This, to me, was one of the, frankly, more key aha moments in a lot of this data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| because if you look at the chart, you can see over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| since 2010 until this commission was seated, our general fund balance has gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| But the assumption here is if we're being good stewards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| if we want to try to maintain our healthy general fund balance as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| kind of what you're telling, if you could just kind of elaborate and clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| is that based on that fund's balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| you're saying it's limited in its ability to support new general obligation debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| So is that saying, you know, kind of going back toward, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| we've got a scale that you've shown with it going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| We've just talked about schools needing more things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| So where is that inflection point on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| So we're saying if we finance the schedule that you provided, then we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| But what is that tipping point where if it starts to go back up to a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| If you could elaborate on that just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| And Chris may need to chime in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| I think the general point that you kind of touched on was that we don't typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| we wouldn't, based on the assumptions that we have included here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| we don't see there being the general fund able to support issuing additional debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| Based on the level of fund balance that we're looking at maintaining going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| as you said, the county has done a really good job of building that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| We don't want to knock it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| So we didn't see that there was any additional funds sitting in the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| that could be used to support additional debt projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| As Chris and Melanie will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| all the debt projects are typically paid for out of the debt service fund specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| But as a resource of the county, we did want to take a look at it and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| could you leverage any additional money in this account to support additional bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| Or pay cash for things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| So in a very layman's term, are you saying the credit card is maxed out for this credit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| Not the other funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| And I think more to your question is that if the revenues were to outpace more than what we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1877)|
| 0:31:25| then certainly there might be capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| But for right now, I mean, looking to the finance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| and really looking at how they think about a budgetary process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| and that they certainly don't want to plan for revenues to come in at a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| and then not transpire and you have that operational deficit in your general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1898)|
| 0:31:44| And that's what we're trying to make sure we do not have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| in which your expenditures are outpacing your revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| Because that is a red flag in terms of not being able to operate money in, money out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| for county essential services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| And sort of debt is not viewed as an essential service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| That's sort of housed in the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| So I guess to summarize and use Commissioner Jay's kind of metaphor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| if you look at the general fund as our debit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| in terms of where you've got emphasis using the word debit card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| you're saying, hey, based on the balance you're keeping in your checking account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| probably not a good idea to include this as part of your debt plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| unless you see your balance is up and maybe you want to pay for something in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| But it's a different story when we're looking at our debt service fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| which you're about to go over, which is the, quote, credit card versus debit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| We have to use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| I'd say I'm not smart enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| I have to put things in very simple terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Can you help me out just a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| We started talking about $600 million, $700 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| On these different taxes on page 8, 1.5% means how much in dollar wise for that tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| And then how much is, too, on the optional sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| And the other revenue is 1.0, and that would be difference amount instead of general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| Would we have an idea how much money that would be in dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| If we can look at the CAFR, we can give you an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Can we come back to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Because I'd want to make sure to give you a more precise number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| because everything was based on FY17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Because most people want to know dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Percentage wise it doesn't mean the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Historically, Chris, have we met that 1.5% the last two years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| He's not listening to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| He's in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| He may not have heard you, King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| Historically, over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| I don't think we've met the 1.5% property tax growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| It's been closer to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| But have we met the local option sales tax of 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2026)|
| 0:33:51| We beat local option sales tax, so that kind of offsets a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| I think how we're starting to look at property tax now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| where we're pulling out OTAs and budgeting those separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| and I think you'll start to see that number of 1.5 be consistent again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| But until we pull OTAs out, no, it makes that number down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| I will tell you we did talk today a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| January was up as far as property tax goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| We were actually flat through December, and January was better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| And so it would be interesting to see how we finish February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| I think people are waiting to pay in February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| because there's not a tax incentive to pay anymore in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| When you say you pull out the OTAs before you run the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| how does that give us an accurate picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| They're a revenue reducer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| That's right, but we do it as a contra revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| What was happening was there may be two or three years of OTAs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| coming out of current year property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| So you put them back in the years they belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| We can't do that, but what we can do is pull them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| and budget it for them like we do TIFs and PILOTs as a negative revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| On the local option sales tax, the 2%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| what are other counties doing, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| Because that seems pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| Do you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| I will say, so on sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| there is a little bit of a mixed feeling about sales tax for a few reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Online sales is a concern of, while we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| there is some level of collection at the state level for online sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| I, for one, and maybe it's just because I don't sit with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| I'm not a county official or sit in a county finance department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| it seems that the money hasn't quite figured out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| like coming down to the local government level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| And I don't know if it's just the pure infrastructure for collecting it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| is trying to, you know, we're learning as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2166)|
| 0:36:07| But that component of the sales tax is a little concerning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| because it hasn't necessarily, while it's being collected at the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| you have not seen a local government say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| oh, okay, I'm net-net neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| You're really relying at this point on any organic growth in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| or sheer volume in terms of people spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| because economic conditions are strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| So the 2% level is, I have to commend your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| They were not ultra-conservative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| but they were also trying to be realistic that unless we start to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| some material change from the money coming from online sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| trickling from the state down to locals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| this is really going to be relying on organic growth in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| and economic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Is that helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Yeah, because basically now when it's returned from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| historically it goes to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| because of how many brick-and-mortar stores they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| And that's where the county is getting hurt big time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| I think I have an answer on your 1.5% growth on property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| I did this very back of the envelope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| but it looks like it's an additional $1.8 million in revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| I think that's total for all property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Yes, for all property taxes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| It's $800,000 just for the debt service piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| if we didn't move the pennies around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Okay, moving to slide nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| So now we kind of took a similar approach to the debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| We looked at 1% and 1.5% growth rates for property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| and other local revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| We did include some of the transfers from the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| some of the agreements that the school has with the county to repay debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| The debt service fund does have the additional bond issues built into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| as we do project out the balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| And we also, to try to look a little bit further ahead, to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| okay, well, we know we have 19 through 23 approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| but what about 24 through 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| We basically just repeated the 19 through 23 capital improvement fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| So the same amount of projects just rolled forward another five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| to try to help us get a better overview of the balance of that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| So as you can see down here at the bottom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| we would project that estimated about $1.5 million of that fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| could be used to leverage an additional $18 million approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| of general obligation debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| To kind of simplify this, you're saying the cash flow of about a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2337)|
| 0:39:04| and a half in cash flow, annual cash flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| could be used to support just under $20 million in general debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| Is that kind of a simple person's way of looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| Yes, that is perfectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| Please repeat that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| When you look at the statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| PFM estimates that approximately $1.5 million of projected future fund balances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| could be leveraged to support an additional $18.64 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| of general obligation debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| My simple way of looking at this is saying, so what on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| you're saying the cash flow to that fund would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| if we spent an additional $1.5 million in cash flow from this fund's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2379)|
| 0:39:45| projected cash flows, it would not be a huge negative to our ratings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2385)|
| 0:39:52| and we can handle the cash flow, but that would result in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| at current interest rates approximately $18.64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2397)|
| 0:40:02| or rounding off just a little under $20 million in debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| based on a cash flow that would go on for 20 years of $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Then you try to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| You could do the present value of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Back to Commissioner Jay's, what's the present value of $1.5 over that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| to get more of an actual obligation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| We can essentially afford up to $18 million more of debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| with our current allowance, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| Moving to slide 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| This is the second piece of this approach where we want to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| what will additional bond issues affect the county's credit rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| with their rating agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| As you can see, the county is currently AA1 by Moody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| and AA Plus by S&P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Those are just one notch off of being a AAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| so you're kind of right there on the cusp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| In order to look at this capacity, we kind of have to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| the affordability aspect of this analysis and just look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| we're trying to say if you were to additional X amount of debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| what number does that get to start downward pressure on your rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| to where you would want to say, okay, hold on a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2484)|
| 0:41:26| we don't want to approve $150 million of additional debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| because it's going to get us a downgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| That's kind of what we're trying to take a look at here in this perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| We basically use the financial information that we currently have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| with some of PFM's calculator models to estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| at what point does additional debt start to downward pressure on the rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| We did find that the FY19 capital improvement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| that's already been in place, that will not have any negative effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| on the county's rating going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| As you can see here on the right, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| I kind of skipped over this piece right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| in the Moody's Investors Service box and the S&P box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| we have kind of the breakout of your credit rating score in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| and how it's calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| You can see that debt and pension is listed at 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| so debt is only 10% of your total overall credit score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| with debt being 10% of the credit score under S&P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| You mean debt service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Yes, debt service. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| But essentially, related to the slide before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| the tipping point is more than $18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| It starts going downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| Can I ask you a question about credit rating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| or are we going to wait until the next deck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| I don't want to jump ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| What aspects of the ratings methodology could Knox County work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| to get closer to a higher rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| I mean, a higher rating would be a reduced cost, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| A higher rating would essentially cost of capital would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| Probably best to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Go through some slides that will actually spell that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| I'll go through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| I will say that the spread differential between a AA1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| and a AAA is rather nominal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| It changes, obviously, based on market conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| but it's probably 5 to 10 basis points, so 0.05%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| But 0.05% on a big chunk of debt is still a big chunk of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| It's not insignificant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| but I always want people to be mindful of the delta between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| It's a much different delta when you start moving down the spectrum of the scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| So as your credit quality goes down from AAA all the way down to AAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| those spreads will widen as you go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| I have a couple of debt questions, I mean Moody's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| Are you all good to leave the debt stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| You want to talk about credit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| You're done with debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| I did give Nick the harder one to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2644)|
| 0:44:08| The sort of theme of this credit analysis and benchmarking study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| is all very positive for the county, so I want to say that going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| It's a lot of material, so I will try to move through it quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| but I certainly want to answer any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| There is a repetitive nature aspect to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| I'm Lauren Lowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| So if you have questions, just wave your hands or say Lauren, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| So I'll jump into it, and hopefully it will address your questions, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| and if not, certainly ask as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| So on page 2, this is an overview of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| So the county, as you know, is rated AA1 by Moody's and AA plus by S&P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Some of those factors that Nick just covered on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| they're very similar for both Moody's and S&P that they look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| which is your local economy, the management of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| and the financial performance of the county, as well as the outstanding debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Debt is inclusive of other contingent liabilities, pending lawsuits, and pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2704)|
| 0:45:11| We then looked at the county's credit and took it in a different format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2711)|
| 0:45:15| meaning we wanted to look at peer communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| We looked inside and outside of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| We focused on counties of similar size, similar credit rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| and their location within a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| I will say, generally, the county looks very strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| We looked at median levels of AAAs, which we know you're not AAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| but given that there is such a close alignment to the county's credit to a AAA median,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| we looked at those, and we looked at AA1 medians nationally as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| The only area that you're going to see as a concern is debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| Now, that's counter to what Nick just said and said debt's only 10% of the score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| but at the end of the day, debt is a small piece of the rating criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2752)|
| 0:45:57| It is one of the smallest pieces, and Tennessee is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| Because our school districts don't have taxing authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| the burden is on the shoulders of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| So what S&P and Moody's have trained themselves to do is realize that any county in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| their debt levels are going to look out of whack when you look at a community outside of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| But if you think about total or aggregate debt of a tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| most communities outside of Tennessee have city debt, county debt, and school district debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| We don't have that. We just have city and county debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| So your individual community here has no different tax burden, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| than a community outside of your state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| It just looks different. The picture of it is more heavily tilted towards the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| So we have worked with them very closely for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| They understand it and respect it, but know that your ratios are going to look unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| compared to other counties outside of Tennessee, but very similar to counties within the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| So jumping into the next section, which actually officially starts on page 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| this is an overview of your debt and your credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| As we saw earlier, the outstanding bonded or rated debt of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| the principal balance is $619 million, which has the two ratings that I referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| AA1 and AA+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| The spectrum at the bottom gives you sort of the highest rating you can receive of AAA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| all the way to a BAA3 or a BBB-.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| There is a whole other set of letters that I don't put on here because that's non-investment grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| and that's typically not common of a local government because you do have taxing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| So I just should be clear, that's just investment grade ratings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| You tend to see Tennessee communities sort of be in that AA, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| AA2, AA3, or AA, AA-.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| The next page is 6. I will not go through it unless you have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| This is the outstanding debt. It is the same information from the previous PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| So on page 7, let me talk a little bit about the risk matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| which we've started to touch on, of the county's debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| All of this is not necessarily alarming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| and risks should not be taken as a concern that there is something that you are not prepared to weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| This is intended to disclose that S&P and Moody's have factored these risks into your credit already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| So these are pieces of debt that have been outstanding for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| The first three are lumped together because those are variable rate swapped to fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| That's that synthetic fixed rate reference that we saw earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| They do have inherent risks that we've sort of checked the box, if you will, as you go across this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| I don't intend to go through each one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| but this is things that your administration and management team has worked through and managed through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| and they're not a concern from a credit perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| but something that they've always been aware of and managed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| The variable rate debt is, as we talked about earlier, that is subject to interest rate volatility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| but it is naturally hedged by the county's fund balance, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| because that's also a variable rate inflow of interest as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| The last four are all related to federal tax payment subsidy law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| So those are the ones that we referred to by which the federal government is making an interest payment to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2949)|
| 0:49:15| and those have been subject to the sequestration we talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| and that it's now about 6.3% of your interest payment that was due from the federal government has now been reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| So those have a different level of considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| and all of which have been factored into not only the budgetary side of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| but also the credit side of the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| We're good to move to the next section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| So the next section includes a slide for each rating agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| So the first one we'll cover is Moody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| So both agencies sort of took some heat after the financial crisis for not being transparent in how they rate credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=2991)|
| 0:50:00| not just local government, but all credits that they rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| S&P got a pretty significant hand slap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| but what this calls is they now have very clear, direct criteria that we can follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3007)|
| 0:50:14| and it's in the form of what we call a scorecard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| So an investor could actually mirror the credit quality of a local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| or whatever kind of investment they want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| So that's what we've done here is we've followed their scorecard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Now, we all know they're analysts, and they have committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| and none of us get the pleasure of sitting in those committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| so there is still a little bit of decision-making behind the curtain, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| but it's usually rather transparent and very quickly to realize in their reports where they've made adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| We refer to them below-the-line adjustments or qualitative adjustments that they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| They're separate and apart from just purely a mathematical score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3046)|
| 0:50:50| The areas that Moody's focuses on are the economy, the financial strength,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| and the management and governance of the county, as well as the debt profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Moody's is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| They do evaluate your pension obligation different than you will see reported in your own financial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| They do this to create everybody's-on-a-level playing field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| so they discount and look at your pension obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Everybody has the same discount rate, and we factor that into our analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| So on the right-hand-let me jump to the box on the right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| The lower the score, the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| It's like golf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| S&P is going to be the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| When we did the pure mathematical calculation, the county's credit rating came out at a AA3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| We know it's a AA1, so we look for those qualitative adjustments that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| We knew very quickly the institutional presence of UT and TVA were positive and were noted as such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| The Regional Economic Center of Knoxville is also a big component of the driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| We also think, while it's not noted here because we didn't see it explicitly written in their report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| we also think that the fund balance score, they make a concession or adjustment to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| because that fund balance includes a five-year trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| And so if you ever look at a point where a fifth year is sort of off or different or abnormally high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| it can make that ratio look wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| So what they'll then do is take a step back and look at year six, seven, and that time between the five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| And they'll make their own adjustments in credit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| and make sure that it's sort of reflective of how the community actually operates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| So any questions on that part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| So we'll move to S&P on the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| S&P, it's a similar set of categories that they rate and they're weighting thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| I mean, you'll notice the economy is the largest component to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3153)|
| 0:52:37| We almost wonder if they have your score that we calculate on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| I do wonder if they make a qualitative adjustment and that your score may even be from a 2 to a 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| But just know this is just naturally how the score came out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| which resulted in a weighted score of a 1.9, which results in a AA+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| I suspect the credit's actually a little bit stronger than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| but given that we kind of landed right at the AA+, we felt like it was solid and we were comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| It's very quick to see that in this table here, the debt and contingent liability is a 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| That goes back to the references I made earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| because this county, as every other 95 counties that we have in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| they're bearing the burden of sort of two entities that you typically don't see outside of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| I'll make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I'll point out that two years ago, I think it was, two years ago, S&P really came within an eyelash of making us AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3206)|
| 0:53:39| And so we had a conversation with them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| It was two years, I think it was two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| And they chose to keep us where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| And so we were happy with that, but ultimately that shows you that I think what she is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3228)|
| 0:53:57| and she'll continue to say, is that we're right on the edge of AAA on both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| It's not like we're at the bottom of AA+, or AA1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| And just because S&P had that discussion, we were waiting for the rating to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| and it was like a day late, and we're like, what's up with this rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| What's taking so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| And they call us, and you're like, oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Chris, me and you talked about it a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| I think it's important that being what we are and going to that AAA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| the cost of being AAA and maintaining that may outweigh the savings that we get in the interest rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| just by having to stay that far ahead of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| And then if you have a drop in your interest rate or in your rating, it looks bad on you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| and it gets everybody to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| I've often said that nobody will talk about the rise of AAA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| They'll talk about the fall back to AA+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| So if and when we get there, we've got to have a strategy to stay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| because we don't want to come and get there and then fall right back down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| because we have a big bond issuance or we have an economic downturn that we didn't expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3297)|
| 0:55:06| In your analysis, were there any big elements that put us at a significant risk of downgrade from where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| or is it pretty solid and steady?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| It's solid. It's very solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| And you'll see as we go through the comparison analysis is that was there sort of a red flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| or something that came as we started looking into it as just, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| we don't want to look at Knox County in a silo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| We stepped back and said, okay, let's look at all medians for AA1s, AAAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| as well as some peers to stay inside and outside of the community and see what we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| And it was really strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| When you looked at the peer comparison, I know we're about to get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| did you look at debt, property tax rate, growth indexes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| sort of things that also would be variable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| You know what we didn't look at that I thought about over the weekend is the property tax rate in those communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| because that often will be a consideration, if you will, meaning do you have bandwidth to raise it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3352)|
| 0:56:01| Are you sort of already at a heightened level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| And what's the process by which you have to raise it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| So one thing that you'll see as we go through this is there's a reference to an institutional framework score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| and you'll see you have the highest score possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| All local governments in Tennessee have that benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| That's because in Tennessee you can raise property taxes if you choose as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| You don't have to go to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| You can also fund school projects without having to go to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| So S&P sees that as actually a lot of control or flexibility if you need to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3389)|
| 0:56:35| So there's some places that may have a strong rating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| but they don't have that level of that's out of their control versus it's in your control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| and you have the reins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| So going back to the property tax rate, we did not look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| but that is one element that if there is a place by which there's already sort of at the height of where sort of is acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| there's a financial constraint there that has to be factored in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| And certainly if there's any type of cap on raising property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| because at the end of the day the rating agencies are looking at your ability to make payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| and what's the process to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| And if that reduces your financial flexibility for either affordability reasons or state law reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| it factors into the rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| One thing on page 10 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| I noticed down here the one thing that brings our score down to 1.90 is the debt and contingent liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:38| What is the process to make that score better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| So I think unfortunately given that you as a county have the obligation to fund school debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| and as you know you have to educate within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| I think that there's little ability to improve the score| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| and continue to fund the maintenance and capital needs of a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| I think the better situation for the county to take and which they have taken is really to focus on those other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3484)|
| 0:58:11| where you have control and you can improve your score,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| because at the end of the day the rating analysts have factored this in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| and that Knox County, as all other counties in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| are going to have heightened debt burdens because of the school obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| and that you have a statutory obligation to fund schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| because they don't have the ability to raise their own revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| The only other consideration you can take is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| and one of which the county did implement in 2018, is a structure to try to pay down debt faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3520)|
| 0:58:47| In 2018 we worked with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| They did choose to structure the payments as level principal versus level debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3530)|
| 0:58:56| So level debt service looks just like mortgage style principal and interest every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| Level principal actually created descending slope of debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| and what that will do is it creates naturally debt capacity very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| and shifts that burden to paying more principal than interest on the front end versus on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| So that was a step that the county did just recently take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| but we also want to be mindful of affordability aspects of that structure as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| So how much more money did that cost us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| It actually would save you in total debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| It saved you interest costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| Alright, but in a year's time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| Oh, in a year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| I don't have the numbers in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| If you don't mind we can look and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| But I don't remember the specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| Well, I don't want to guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| I don't want to speculate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| But we certainly can look and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| On page 12 starts the peer group comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| I will say the rest of this packet has a lot of information and a lot of repetitiveness to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3595)|
| 1:00:00| so I'll try to move quickly but also make sure that you all have a chance to sort of process the visuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| Here's a list of all the counties listed alphabetically that we chose to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| Some inside the state, some right next door, some all the way as far west as Shelby County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| and then we looked outside as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| We looked at the current credit ratings, so we took ratings inside the state, above and below the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| and outside the state, above and below the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| We looked at the population and the market value to sort of get a good mix of communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3625)|
| 1:00:31| to see kind of where do we see unique features or areas of concerns or improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| I was just going to make a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| On Hamilton County, their property tax rate is $2.76 where ours is $2.12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| so you can see where they've got additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| They just raised theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3653)|
| 1:00:58| And Shelby County's is $4.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3658)|
| 1:01:03| It's high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| As a Shelby County resident, it's high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| In some counties, almost like ours, it's $2.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Would you have the ability to reissue slide 12 with the tax rates as another column and send that to us separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| Sure, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| Yeah, that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| I will say that non-Tennessee counties will have to look at it because sometimes they do it like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| but nonetheless, we can figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| We'll send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| So the next six to seven, maybe eight slides are going to give you the same framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| and let me walk through what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| On the top right-hand corner, it's going to cover the category that the rating analyst would consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| So this first one's economy, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| and then it gives you the five-year history of the county and the blue bars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and then the brownish-shaded line that goes all the way across, that's going to be your triple-A counties nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| The orange line that goes across, it's flat-lined, that's going to be your double-A1 counties nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3716)|
| 1:02:03| and then the yellow is going to be those peer counties that we selected in the previous slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3723)|
| 1:02:08| So you can kind of see what we're looking for is unique features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| and this is a quick one to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| We're looking at the full value or the tax value, the tax base of the county per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| and in this case, it comes out to about $88,000 per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| which is right on top of the medians of double-A1s as well as the peer groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| It's not surprising to see triple-A counties tend to have larger tax bases, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| That factors into the economy score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Yet again, that's 30 percent of the score.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| So when you say tax base, are you talking about more people, or are you talking about more value for each person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3759)|
| 1:02:45| More value per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| So it's your taxable value, the property that can be taxed within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| divided by the number of people in your county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Okay, and so when you're talking about with us having a low tax rate, that affects that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| So if we raise the tax rate a certain number, it would get us up closer to that triple-A is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| It actually won't impact that because it's just the actual value of the property, the appraised values of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| So not the rate, the appraised value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| Correct, not the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| It's kind of odd they carry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| They look at the potential but not the utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| Well, I will say, I mean, I think they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Kind of going back to your point is that if there was a concern that meaning your tax rate was high or low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| I do think that they will factor in because if there is honestly not willingness to go up or ability to even go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3809)|
| 1:03:37| then they do realize there is sort of the credit card really is maxed out in a whole different set of perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| So I do think that that is factored in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| I mean, they will make comments related to the all-in tax burden of a community in certain areas in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3826)|
| 1:03:55| It's really, really high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| We're fortunate in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| It's a low-tax state across east to west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| But nonetheless, it's just not quite the same level of consideration as they do the tax base, you know, as your point was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3841)|
| 1:04:15| On the next slide, it is the effective buying income per person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| So really discretionary income that an individual may have in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3859)|
| 1:04:24| This one they don't look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| There's a median level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| They actually factor in as a percentage of the United States effective buying income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3868)|
| 1:04:33| And so in this case, we're reporting the United States effective buying income in the orange line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| which is approximately $24,969, where the county's is $24,771.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| So right on top of the United States effective buying income and slightly above the peer group that we selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3884)|
| 1:04:51| On page 15, the unemployment rate, which shows everyone's benefited from the economic conditions of the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3891)|
| 1:04:58| but the county has outpaced the metrics that we looked at here in terms of the considerations of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3898)|
| 1:05:06| Tennessee and the Knoxville MSA, the county's unemployment rate is below all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| On page 16, we're moving into the financial scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| This is your general fund balance as a percent of your general fund revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| So Tennessee counties, much like have elevated debt levels, they also tend to have more reserves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| and that is to offset typically the additional liability, the debt liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| So you're going to see that as a consistent theme throughout Tennessee counties or many Tennessee counties, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| So in this case, you'll see that the county is right on top of your peers, the yellow line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3938)|
| 1:05:46| and actually outpaced the medians of AAA and AA1 counties nationally with your fund balance levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3946)|
| 1:05:54| The next slide, which is 17, is just a little bit more granular view of your fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3954)|
| 1:06:01| It's focused on the unassigned portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Similar to just fund balance as a whole, Tennessee will tend to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| our counties tend to have higher unassigned fund balances to offset the debt burdens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| In this case, the county outpaces all of medians we reported, both peer, AAAs, and AA1s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3973)|
| 1:06:24| So the next two slides are debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| So the next one is on page 18, debt as a percent of full value, or that's their appraised or tax value of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3988)|
| 1:06:37| It is debt outstanding to the par amount, not debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| And looking at this, you can quickly see that, I mean, there's a scaling consideration here as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| but the county's debt as a percent of your tax base is higher than the medians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| No surprise, we knew it was going to happen with the national medians because of the school debt that the county bears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| not only your debt, but the school's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| The peer group, because we selected communities in and outside of the state, that wasn't surprising to us either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| And so we were not alarmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| While it is higher than the peers median, we weren't concerned by it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4030)|
| 1:07:14| because we recognize there's a mixed bag of references there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4034)|
| 1:07:17| and this is one of those metrics where you'll see a unique reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| I guess one request we might make, if there's any follow-up on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| it might be interesting to get this slide updated with the peer group that is exclusively Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| Sure, sure, happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| I think that would be a little, that would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Because, you know, we've always heard, you know, we've got a lot of debt, but to simplify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| and, you know, we're seeing how we compare across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| but really how do we compare to our Tennessee peers that are like-minded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| That would be interesting, one extra line of data that would make this a little more relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| Sure, and one of the slides I'm going to cover in just a minute will give you a little bit more detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| but we certainly can add that because I think that would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| because this will give you a five-year trend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4077)|
| 1:08:00| The last slide on debt is debt service as a percent of operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| so how much of your annual cost outflow, you know, is related to debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| and how much is related to actual operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| I will tell you the peer median of 11.2% is skewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| One of them was an outlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| We suspect there was a unique issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| We didn't dive into it because they were not in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| and we didn't know the community well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| but I suspect that if we would have pulled them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| the peer median would have probably been much more on top of where the county is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| and so the county is very close to, ironically, the AAAs, which is higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| In this case, higher is worse than lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| AAAs tend to actually have more debt obligations on a debt service basis than AA1s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| So I will say that this 11.2 is skewed for one particular community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| that you'll see in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| So I know I need to be respectful of time, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| We're at 4.40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| I would say you've got about our next meeting starts at 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| I know we'll need some time to take a quick break and set up for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| so you've probably got at least nine, you know, ten solid minutes for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4152)|
| 1:09:17| I'll try to finish before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| All right, so the next section is a little bit different view of that peer group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| and I think maybe it will answer some of the questions that you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| I'm going to, in the essence of time, jump on to page 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| So the layout of this is slightly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| So it's going to go from left to right, lowest to highest on all metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| In-state, in the state of Tennessee, is going to be the lighter grays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| The darker grays are going to be out of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| And then the county, Knox County, we gave two metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| We gave the 17 number and the 16 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| Keep in mind this is information that's reported by Moody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| They're using the FY17 information because of just timing of their database.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| So this one is the full value that we talked about earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| so what's the actual property value of the community in billions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| You'll see Charleston County, South Carolina, far right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| They have a really, you know, large tax base, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| And your county is sort of right in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| No surprise, Shelby County would also be farther on the right-hand side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| but they have more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| It's just a different set of circumstances over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| Williamson County tends to always benefit from a rather large and robust tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| You can see that your tax base has improved from year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| On page 23, it's that tax base per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4235)|
| 1:10:39| and you can see this sort of gives you the same sort of lowest to highest, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| Williamson County, no surprise, is sort of an outlier there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| Shelby County actually earlier looked like it had a high tax base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| but when you look at it in comparison to the per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| it's actually on the lowest one in the peer group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| And the county is right in the middle and right on top of the median levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| that we were reviewing of AA1s and AAAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| On the effective buying income, on the right-hand side, you'll see Williamson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| and that will sort of you see now Knox County is shifted more towards the right end of this graphic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| and your effective buying income or discretionary spending of individuals in your community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| is more on the higher end of this peer group in comparison as you look into each individual county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4286)|
| 1:11:34| Page 25 starts the financial review of a metric of general fund balance as a percent of general fund revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4294)|
| 1:11:43| You can see that on this graphic, it's quick to notice that the three largest ones are all Tennessee counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4303)|
| 1:11:52| kind of going back to the fact that Tennessee counties tend to keep more reserves than other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| But it's good to see that Knox County is sort of right in the middle of its peer group here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| and improving its fund balance levels year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4322)|
| 1:12:09| Similarly, on the unassigned general fund balance on page 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| you'll see that the county is on the higher end of the unassigned general fund balance level in comparison to its peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| And you start to see a little bit divergence of some of the unassigned portions of Tennessee counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| sort of being more spread throughout the spectrum of peers that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| We did know that the fund balance of the county has been a significant factor within the credit quality for both S&P and Moody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4353)|
| 1:12:42| So the next two slides are specific to debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Debt is a percent of the full value, and you'll see that we've given you all of the ones on the right-hand side of this graphic on page 27| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4365)|
| 1:12:55| are all Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| So that goes back to the consideration that debt is taken on for schools in the Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| Can I ask a question out of pure ignorance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| On the unassigned general fund balance, over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| we've gotten down I think once or twice into the single digits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4389)|
| 1:13:13| When you're counting that, are you counting the investment dollars that we have tied up in investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| not just what's in the general fund ledger that we see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| Right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| They look at funds that can be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| So to gain that, we've got to sell off our investments and risk the revenue that we lose on the investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4404)|
| 1:13:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| But they do factor in liquid assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Because it's too close for me to be comfortable with them saying that's a great asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| because we see it as getting down to a couple of days' worth of operating dollars in the fund account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| Yeah, that's actually a great point is that the county, like many counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| you actually live off of your fund balance, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| because you pay your employees probably twice a month or every two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| but your money doesn't come in every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| So, yeah, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| So on page 27 on the debt as a percent of the full value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| you'll see that all the bars on the right are all Tennessee counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| No surprise there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| And that's reflective of the debt that the county bears for both itself and for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4450)|
| 1:14:18| And when you look at it, if you were to take this graphic and think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| total debt for these other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| I suspect they would all look much more in line with Tennessee counties as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4463)|
| 1:14:30| So here is the outlier that I mentioned on page 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| So the debt service as a percent of operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| something seems wrong in the Richland County, South Carolina one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| It's reported by Moody's this way, so we didn't dare ask Moody's what was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| Nonetheless, we did know that that was probably impacting that 11.2 percent median.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| But regardless, the story was still the same, whether that outlying factor was in there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4488)|
| 1:14:54| The county's debt service as a percent of operating expenses was right in the middle of its peer groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4494)|
| 1:15:00| and in line with the AA and AAA medians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4500)|
| 1:15:07| So with three minutes to spare, on page 29, this is the last page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| Actually, it's more of a visual, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| When we think about the credit quality of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| we tend to look at these metrics in the first column, the five-year trend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| the relative to your selected peers, and then relative to the median AA1 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| because that's where you are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| And if you see green, that means you're outperforming those metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| Red means you're underperforming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Seeing that there's a consolidation of the red related to debt does not concern us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4536)|
| 1:15:41| given that that's just the nature of all communities in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4541)|
| 1:15:46| And so we walked away from this project feeling very comfortable with the county's credit quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| and that it's not pressured and that these guys have done a really good job managing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| and sort of preparing you all for what's to come in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| There's a lot of material in the back in case you want to see how the metrics are calculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| but not for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| We've got another minute or two if anybody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| But I'd also ask, when you get some of the updated slides, when we can compare ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| some of these might be fun to rerun just with the pure Tennessee peers adding that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| And then I would say send those to Mr. Caldwell, and he will forward them out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4582)|
| 1:16:29| Yeah, happy to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| Well, I do have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Will this study be made public in any way, and how would the general public know about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4593)|
| 1:16:41| Is this something that's issued or is this rolled into the annual report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| It's something that we could put online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| I don't have an issue of putting it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| But I think other than that, that's something that we would do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| because a lot of that stuff is already probably contained when we issue bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| When we issue duties and S&P puts out things, a lot of that is kind of, for us, is regurgitated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| But as far as putting the studies online, I don't mind to put that on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| I think if you're adjusting a few slides and including some of the things we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| then, you know, take your time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| But I think at some point, one scintilla of a percent of a person would ever read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4634)|
| 1:17:20| But I think it is good private to basically say we've got a good report about our data structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4640)|
| 1:17:26| There's some good things to report about how we manage our finances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| and we ought to at least make that available to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| That's one of the things, when we called this meeting, it was to educate us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| but also because this was a sunshine meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I mean, ultimately, just by having this meeting, it kind of helps make this information public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| That was one of the other motives for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| Yes, sir, Commissioner Busser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| I know we don't have the time for this, but sometime in the near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| I'd like to go over a couple of things that were said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| And one of them has to do with leveraging, and the other one is the ability to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| and see how we rank in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| But leveraging always bothers me because you can get in trouble if you leverage too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4682)|
| 1:18:07| and I just want to make sure we understand what leveraging is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267190219ChairmanBriefing?start=4687)|
