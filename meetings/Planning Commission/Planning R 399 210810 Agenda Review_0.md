| 0:00:30| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| Welcome to the August agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=31)|
| 0:00:36| We don't have a big agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=36)|
| 0:00:39| One thing I want to ask everyone is when you do get an e-mail from the staff about attending this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=39)|
| 0:00:46| do reply because they are purchasing meals for all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=46)|
| 0:00:51| and if people don't show up, then that's just money down the drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=51)|
| 0:00:56| other than people who could pick up the lunch and take it back with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=56)|
| 0:00:59| But let them know if you're planning on being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| We'll be ready for Thursday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| I'll go ahead and turn it over to Director Brooks for the August agenda review items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=72)|
| 0:01:14| Good morning, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=74)|
| 0:01:16| Thank you all for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| We don't have too many updates for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| I just wanted to let you know we're just remaining busy with applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| August was a particularly busy month, but we also had quite a few vacations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| and a lot of back-to-school preparation for many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| So we did release a couple new reports that I wanted to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| One came out of Planning's Information Services Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| They wrapped up the 2021 facts and figures brochure, and it's available on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| And after this meeting, I'm going to send you links to this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=106)|
| 0:01:49| as well as some information that Ellen from our Transportation Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=109)|
| 0:01:54| as well as our Information Services team prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| It's updated crash data for 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| You all have a handout, a really nice infographic that they presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| and there also is a lot of great information on our website about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| So right now this is information that's being used to help us think about ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| that we can work in a more coordinated fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| to address some of these life-altering crashes that are occurring in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| I'm not going to go through it today, but I really encourage you to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| And one thing I'd like to do at our Education and Work Session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| is to combine a short presentation on this data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| as well as some additional presentations that I think are relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| that have come up related to how we are addressing or not addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| allowing uses that serve our community members that are dealing with addiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| because I think that there is data in here that ties back to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| that is really relevant to that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=172)|
| 0:02:55| So in a few months, I'm hoping that we can all get back together to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| And so with that, I have reserved October 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| I'm hoping that works for everybody's schedule for us to have an education session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| If you recall at our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| we discussed moving those presentations that we typically have at these meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| on a quarterly basis to move those to a quarterly information session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| that we would have separate from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| This is unusual for us to have such a short agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| but typically our agendas have been quite full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| We want to make sure that you all have enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| to discuss some of the information that's presented to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| So if you all could take a look at your calendar for October 5th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| that would be really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| We are hoping to meet in this room, and it would be from 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| We'll have coffee, some morning snacks, start at 9 and conclude at 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| Unless I hear otherwise from you all, we'll just proceed with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| and then I'll go ahead and place those quarterly dates on your calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| so you can plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Does that work for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| I'm seeing thumbs up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| I think that is all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| There is an event that our staff shared out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| For those of you who are interested, there's a walking tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=256)|
| 0:04:18| that's going to take place in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| I'm going to try and share these out with you all more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| It's Bike Walk Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| and they're hosting a walking tour of North Knoxville on August 16th at 6 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| and it's with some of the city council candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| so some of you might be interested in joining in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| Anybody else have any announcements or any information they'd like to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| So we'll just get into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| So the first item is item number 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| It came from staff, and we are requesting withdrawal of that agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| And the reason is in April of this year, our staff recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| and this body approved a similar use determination to approve a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| or a place of worship as a permitted use in the SC shopping center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| and that's what this item is related to is to amend the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| to allow church place of worship as a permitted use in the SC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| And so per section 5.3402 of the county code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| the planning commission may recommend the inclusion of other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| of a related nature to the SC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| So after consulting with county codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| we have an agreement that that use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| I apologize, that similar use determination that was approved by this body in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=330)|
| 0:05:37| to allow places of worship to locate in shopping centers would suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| So there's no reason to move forward with this zoning ordinance amendment at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=342)|
| 0:05:48| Does anybody have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| We'll just be asking for withdrawal of that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Seeing no questions, we're going to move on to rezonings and plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| So the first item is item number six that we wanted to review with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| The applicant is Dean Preston Smith, 7E21RZ, and the staff is Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| Michelle, do you want to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| So this was a request that was postponed last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| They've since revised their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| So they originally were asking for the CG1 zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| with the general commercial land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| They've now revised their request to ask for the office zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| with the office land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| This one is a little bit unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| and they're only asking for the blue part that you see here on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| the central part of the portion to be rezoned to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| And looking at the future land use class, the city land is shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| The one-year plan has this as designated as LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| with a sliver of the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| You can see it's surrounded by county lands through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| The majority of the surrounding land use is also LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| The zoning map shows the front of this parcel as CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| There's CA and OA and OB zoning along Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| and then it's adjacent to agricultural land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Sorry, the agricultural zone to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| It does look like there is some zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=440)|
| 0:07:21| that goes a little bit deeper on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| but when you look at the existing land use map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| you can see that it's residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| along the other side of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=447)|
| 0:07:31| And then just to give you a little bit of context, here's the aerial view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| There has been some development recently along this part of Westland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| that's not shown yet in this aerial view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| but it's mostly commercial and office uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| This site does have some pretty significant constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| The faint blue lines along here, you can barely see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=469)|
| 0:07:52| They're the streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| The county requires, or sorry, the city requires a 30-foot buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| along from the top of the bank along each side of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| You can also see some pretty significant slope throughout the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| And again, as mentioned, it is in the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| You can see that it's kind of on the upper end of the slope scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| so approaching upwards of 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| So really there's a tiny part in here that's developable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| without some pretty significant mitigation efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| This is the TDEC map that they sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| that shows the channels and the streams a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| You can see it a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| So for this case, we are recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| because it does not meet all of the criteria for a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| There's been no change of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Rezoning the front portion of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| does not by itself provide a change of conditions enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| to warrant the rezoning in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| If that was the case, you could keep making that same argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| to go deeper and deeper into the parcel with rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| I'll keep it up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=539)|
| 0:09:02| It is consistent with the intent purpose of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| as the office is a transitional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| However, as far as the impact on surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| developing here could potentially remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:12| natural landscape and topographical buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| depending on the development that they install.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| And due to the HP and two streams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| again, it requires a lot of mitigation efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| But finally, it's not consistent with the sector plan's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| LDR land use designation without the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| But then the plan amendment does not meet any criteria for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Again, there's no change of conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| There's not been a change of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| There's no error in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| And there's not been a significant change in development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| because the changes in the development pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| have been along Westland and not deeper into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| And the front of this property already has CG1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| So they do have use of that part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| I think it's also important to note that this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=590)|
| 0:09:52| a separate development from the front of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| So they are proposing for this sliver to have one use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| and then for another use to be up here at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| So this would not be a continuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| of whatever is going on in the front of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| And, well, in addition to it not meeting any of the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| that were required to meet to recommend approval of a plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| it also doesn't meet the office land use criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| within the land use classification table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| which calls for generally level sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| As we saw from the maps, there are some significant slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| along the sides of the streams and in the HP area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| With that, I'll open it up to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| I have a question about the history of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=633)|
| 0:10:37| because it has been denied a number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| but for many different requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| So my question is what can they do with this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Well, they've already got office zoning on the front of the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| Again, this is just the central part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| So they do have CH1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| They could do any use that's allowed in CH at the front for this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| They're wanting to do a dental office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| which could easily go in the CG1 part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| It's just at what point do you kind of limit the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| We feel like because there's a pretty definitive line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| where the CA, the office, and commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| kind of comes down westland, kind of parallel to westland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| that this kind of extends that deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| and then kind of sets that pattern for encroachment deeper into the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| And so we feel like where it is now is the appropriate place for it to terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| What did you say is on the property now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| Right now it's vacant, but they do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| this would be a development, it would be a dentist office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| is what they're proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| They don't have a tenant or development plan for this CH part yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| But in answering her question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| what can they do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| What can they do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| Because isn't it zoned LDR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| Nobody's going to build a house back there or five houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| No, and I think it gets confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| because they're dual zoning on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| So they do have use of their land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| because they have the front of the property is CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| So again, this is the whole property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| This part that kind of comes around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| has the most intense commercial zoning on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| So they do have use of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=749)|
| 0:12:31| They're just wanting to rezone this part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| to put an additional use on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| So they're basically wanting to have two developments on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| instead of just the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| So in answer to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| they could put anything allowed in CH1 on this part of the property here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| which is the better part of the property to develop anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| They could use CH1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Yes, on the front portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| that's already zoned to that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| So CH1 being a more intense zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| They could do it on that piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| that they're requesting an office zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| We also denied that request last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| So I guess the appropriate question for you all is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| do you see that they should have more than one use on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| should have more than one development on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| and if so, if an office is appropriate to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Wouldn't they pretty much have to have two separate uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=802)|
| 0:13:28| because the front is CH1 and it has another zoning designation now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| So if we do nothing and they develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| it would be two different, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| If we did nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| we would be able to develop the front half as the CH1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| and the back half would be some sort of ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| so any of the ag uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:50| So if we want to go to the land use table to look at what's allowed in ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| there are a few uses that are non-residential that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=833)|
| 0:14:04| Again, to clarify, the question before you on Thursday will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| do you think it's appropriate to extend commercial uses further into the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=849)|
| 0:14:17| Well, and while Michelle's pulling that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| the question I would have is based on the current layout of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| would they have enough room for all the setback requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| that would be required from the state being up against Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| to even develop that front part with any commercial development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| because it looks very narrow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| And if not, are they trying to extend it so they could do a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| to be able to meet all the setback requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| Michelle has looked at the width of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| and it looks a lot more narrow than it actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Yeah, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to show the table on the screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| because even when I expand it, it doesn't go all the way across to the ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| so we'd have to be taggling back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| So I would encourage you to take a look at the land use table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| I'm sorry, the use matrix within the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| to kind of look at the uses that are allowed in ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| In terms of the property's width, this pinch point from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| Oh, I can just bring it up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| So from this point here to this point here measures about 120 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| So this property, it's a lot bigger than it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| I think it's just because it's so long that it looks really narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| But go ahead and measure it for y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=934)|
| 0:15:40| Michelle, were you around when that front stuff got rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Because I was remembering some pretty healthy discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| on both sides with the homeowners and with those groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| And I think they all agreed that you probably ought to be able to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| at that intersection because how robust the development had been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| But I thought we'd all kind of agreed, even the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| that that creek was going to kind of be a demark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| and everything was going to be kind of from Westland to the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and that was going to be a big buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| And until they got some more land, which I doubt they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| based on what's built on those farms adjoining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| that there was kind of like a little bit of a verbal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| that that's as far as it was going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| But that's just what I was remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=995)|
| 0:16:43| Any other questions on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| So this little triangle, this part was never included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| in the rezone request previously that was denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Actually, I think that some of them included the entire parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| and some of them included just the front part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| But this wasn't included in the last request where the front was rezoned to CH1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| Michelle, how would they gain access to that piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| Would they just run a road driveway parallel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| Yeah, it would have to come through that front portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| And then you've got a buffer on the stream, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| How much buffer would be on the stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| How much buffer what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| On the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| 30 feet from the top of bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| The time you add in that plus a width of a driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| which would probably be 20 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| there's not much property left to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Yeah, to give you an idea where the top of bank is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| I'm going to turn on the, well, that's not very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| Okay, let me go back into the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| So you can kind of see where the parts are at the top of the bank along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| So there would be 30 feet from, I guess, this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| and then 30 feet from wherever it is on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| Was it 30 feet total or 30 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| 30 feet on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| 30 feet on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1094)|
| 0:18:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| We'll move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| This one is Michelle's as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Item number 14, 8H21RZ, S&E properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| You guys have gotten a lot of correspondence about this one so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| This is on Beyvalet Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Just to kind of orient everyone, Knoxville-Sinaloa is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| You can take Washington Pike North and approach the site here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| or you can come along Beyvalet Road here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| That's kind of where the site's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| And looking at the sector plan map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| the property, there's three properties included with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| They are all designated as LDR with a little bit of HP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| around the perimeter of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| It's currently designated or zoned PR with up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| so they would like to keep the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| but increase the density to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| And this site is located in the rural area in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| just across the street from the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| We are recommending approval of three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| The applicant is asking for four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| And just kind of getting into the reason for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| we're looking at the Washington Pike improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| that are scheduled along through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1183)|
| 0:19:44| You can't really tell in great detail what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| but to kind of get everyone acclimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| So if you're looking at Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| it's this part of the roadway that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| And so from Mill Road to Murphy Road would be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| from a two-lane to a five-lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| so there's two travel lanes in each direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| a median, a left-turn lane, shared paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| and green space on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| And then from Mill Road west would be three lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| so very similar, just one travel lane in each direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| but still the median, still the shared path, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| Looking at the existing development around this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| so again, this is at that borderline between the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| and the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| So some of the development that's clustered along that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| where those two meet, have a higher density slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| So the RB zone, that's this one right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| allows lot sizes of down to 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| which are approximately one-acre lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| provided they're sewer-provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| And then this one along here, also in the rural area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| is developed at around two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| The lots get a little bit bigger as you travel away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| from the urban growth boundaries, which is what you would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| And then looking at the density comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1262)|
| 0:21:04| between what the existing density is, what we are recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| and what the applicant is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| So the existing density of 2.5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| would allow 264 single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| which translates then to approximately 2,540 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| The recommended three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| would equate to 317 single-family homes and 3,005 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1286)|
| 0:21:33| And then finally, their requested four dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| would translate into 423 single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| I'm so used to SF being square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| and then 3,919 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| These are numbers, these are just basic calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| that's the absolute max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| It doesn't include any of the land that would have to be given up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| for internal roads or for stormwater infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| buffer zones, any of that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| So the Harris frontage is in the parental responsibility zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| You can see that it's really close to Rita Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| so sidewalks may be required along this frontage here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| The property is in the HP area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| but again, it's kind of clustered around the perimeter of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| The center of the site is mostly 0 to 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| There are a little bit of higher slopes right through here in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| but the majority of the land is below 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| And then the site wouldn't need to use side roads to access it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| just based on the proximity of the different class roads that are around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| So it's got frontage on a collector and an arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1368)|
| 0:22:51| and then to get here from Link, you're also on another arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| coming from a connector this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| so it wouldn't impact traffic on smaller roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| However, we do have some concerns about the width of Beybalay and Harris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| as you guys have seen from a lot of the correspondence that you've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| Just giving you a general context of this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| you can kind of see how it's set up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| and then trying to give you an idea of what the slope looks like here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| So this is the parcel that you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| and then that's how the contours shape up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| so kind of showing you the slope of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| and then just kind of what it looks like in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| Here is the street view of Beybalay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| It's striped, but again, very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Same thing with Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| And then this is Link here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| The slope analysis recommended a maximum disturbance area of 102 acres out of 106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| so again, the HP not really affecting the site that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| Traffic impact analysis will be required at concept phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| and that would identify any improvements that needed to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| based on the use that's approved today, or Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1443)|
| 0:24:10| Anybody have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Predictably, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| So two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| The first one is about how this really fits with the character of the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| because it seems rather large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| and the density is going to be pushing this to be quite different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1464)|
| 0:24:31| from what is in the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| And the second question is about the impact of the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| that are going to be made along Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| It seems like those improvements would only put more pressure on the small road of Beybalay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| as opposed to relieving it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| because it will bring more cars through that area rather than fewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| So let me get down here to this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1495)|
| 0:25:10| Okay, so in terms of the character, maybe the aerial view is probably the best one to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1510)|
| 0:25:18| So there are some, you know, the side streets that are developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| that have more residential housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| I think this kind of reminds me a little bit of the Innsbruck development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| because it's such a large piece of property that I think that it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| gives you more pause because it's got so many more homes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| In terms of the general character, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| some of the developments off of side streets are developed at two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| You know, we're recommending the three based on the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| which it does allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| It's got the LDR land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| which does typically allow up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| However, we're capping it at three because it's in that rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| Instead of being across the street from the planned growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| it's across from the urban growth boundary, so it's closer to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| So we feel like because it's closer to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| that's kind of where you would expect to see some residential growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| It doesn't have a very rural feel to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| just because of those pockets of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| This would be the natural progression as you're moving out of that urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| towards more residential type developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| So that's, you know, one of the reasons that we were feeling like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| even though it might be a little bit, three might be higher than the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| that's currently around there, we don't feel like it's out of bounds really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| based on the need for housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| and the fact that it's so close to the urban growth boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| And then in terms of the road improvements from Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| you know, I feel like, and maybe somebody from engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| could probably maybe encapsulate this a little bit better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| but back to that screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| So, you know, as you're moving people through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| and easing the traffic a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| I don't know that that's going to bring more people onto those side roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| It might bring more people to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| I do feel like, you know, if you're going to be alleviating some of this traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| by creating additional lanes in both travel directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| I think that ultimately helps the traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I think the main problem with it is not really this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| I think the main problem with it is Beyblade and Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| But again, that's not something that we would really consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| until the concept phase because we haven't had that traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| We don't know what's going to come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| I don't know what we really expect to come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| That's where I would defer to engineering for their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Maybe they have, you know, seen this type of thing before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| and could speak a little bit more as to what they would expect to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| Any other questions for Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| One quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| For Rita Elementary School, and I'm sorry I don't have it in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| the student impact, I know assuming that I think most of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| will probably go to Holston and it's got space and Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| which has space, what about the elementary school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1694)|
| 0:28:17| How many students are expected and does Rita have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| for that expected student yield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Or is that something that the county also needs to be thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| as well as the school system about possible expansion of that school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| to meet students without them having to be out in portable classrooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| So according to the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| it shows an estimated student yield of 140 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| and that doesn't really say in the report which would be elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| which would be middle and Gibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| It's kind of all the students combined for all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| In terms of Rita's capacity, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| that's not something that we really dig into in rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| I can reach out and try to find out more information for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| but I don't have that information at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1737)|
| 0:29:09| Any other questions for Michelle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| I'll turn it over to, actually, Michelle, you have the next one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| Number 17, 8K21RZ, Masana Investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1760)|
| 0:29:26| Okay, so this is another challenging one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| This one is on Brackett Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| It is just north of East Emory Road, and then the Tazewell, Pike, Gibbs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| schools are going to be a little bit further to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| just to get everyone acclimated with where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| The sector plan shows this property as LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| There's a little bit of stream protection area coming through it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| To the north is the ag land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| and you'll notice that the land use map corresponds directly to the growth policy map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| So this area is planned growth adjacent to rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| The rural area kind of skirts the Brackett Road until it meets that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| This property is owned ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| It's surrounded by ag zoning as well with the exception of the PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| up to three dwelling units per acre in the rural area to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| And then you've got some RA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| It's a PR with up to four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| The RA zone, again, allows similar lot sizes to the RB in the last one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| allows lot sizes of 10,000 square feet or approximately quarter acre lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| provided that sewer is provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| So the interesting thing about this one, too, is that this is a pretty short road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| It connects East Emery Road, which is a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| to Bell Road, which is a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| Gibbs Schools, and this is the major intersection improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| that were made just a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| That's the change of conditions that we're citing as meeting that criteria for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| Utility lines are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| This provider provides the details on our map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| so you can see exactly where those lines are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| so how far we'd have to tap in to have to extend those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| A small portion of the property is in FEMA flood plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| so there would be probably some buffering involved due to proximity of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| And also, you know, I imagine they would probably just stay out of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| but if so, they did decide that they wanted to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| There would be certain mitigation efforts that they would need to undertake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| with the county stormwater department to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| And contextually, this is the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Again, there's some higher density developments in the immediate area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| And this is the property you're looking at right here, just a general idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| And then brackets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| So it is striped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| However, it's very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| It's 16 feet both directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| And then you've heard a lot about the curve, so this is the curve from street view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1917)|
| 0:32:06| In terms of the plans, it's consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| It supports up to five dwelling units per acre in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| The LDR also allows up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| We're capping it at three just based on the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| It's very similar to the last one in terms of densities of the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| And with that, I'll see if anyone has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| What would the county require in terms of improvements to Bracket Road if a subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| I'm sorry? I'm having trouble hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| What would the county require in terms of upgrading Bracket Road for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| Let me ask my table mate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| Yeah, Chairman, thanks for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| To Michelle's point, it's probably in areas less than 16 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| Historically, our perspective on these is it needs to be 18 to 20 feet before we would allow this type of number of developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1981)|
| 0:33:12| Obviously, without seeing the traffic study and the process vetted through a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| I would anticipate that at least, most likely going back towards Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| that there would be some widening completed to get it within that 18 to 20-foot range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| just to allow for two-way traffic to navigate without getting problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| We would be concerned with adding this traffic without doing some widening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| Would you be concerned at three dwelling units per acre versus five or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| Is there a factor there that you wouldn't be too concerned about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| I want to think about it a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| One of the things that complicates this, too, is in addition to the curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| if you go back towards the other intersection, Bell Road, that location has—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2032)|
| 0:34:00| it's not—it may meet the minimum for sight distance, but it's very tight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| and we all know people obviously drive faster than the speed limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| and the alignment there is problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| From my perspective, I think we'd like to see everybody come back towards Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| and the number of lots is definitely a concern of ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| just because of the width and the intersection there at Bell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Jim, for Thursday, though, there's a bigger conversation with maybe the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2071)|
| 0:34:39| of what you'd be looking at when you're looking at three to five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| so I know Commissioner Smith has mentioned this in different conversations over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| that if you've only got three units—and I'm not advocating for three or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| I'm just making a point here that if you've got three units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2094)|
| 0:34:59| you can only really spend so much on improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| If you've got five units per the acre, if it makes sense from a land use standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| and you've got utilities and access and other things that the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| and the urban growth boundary support, five units per the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| you might be able to do some more off-site improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| that might end up helping the county a little bit more than if you stopped at three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| and they just said, hey, this is all we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| As you think about that, I think on this one and the Babley one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| because there's so many units on that Babley Road one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| that might be something that you think about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| is there a strategic way that you can work a little bit heavier on the improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2140)|
| 0:35:51| I was looking from bracket from the proposed intersection to Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| It's about 2,300 feet, so it's a little less than a half mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| Typically, we normally see or estimate time you design, procure the rights away and widen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| give or take somewhere around $500 per linear foot per lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| That gives you perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| It could be a couple of million dollars to widen that, which to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| that's a lot of money for three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| I'll think on that and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| If there's a current condition there that the county would never get to in a million years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| because it's just not going to fall enough on the high enough of a list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| there might be some merit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2197)|
| 0:36:48| Thank you, Michelle and Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Item number 218021RZ, and that also includes a sector plan amendment, Rusty Biddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| Give Liz just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| I just want to follow up with Commissioner Eddie Smith and your question regarding student and student yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2223)|
| 0:37:10| One thing that we can do is we can reach out to the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| and see if we can get their current capacity numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| and maybe we need to start sharing that with you all on a yearly basis to help inform the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| I think there will also be an opportunity as we are creating this new land use and transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| to really dive into that question about school capacity and how development really impacts our school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:34| and what can we do as a community to be more proactive in addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Well, and one of the things I was going to mention just offline, just less for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| but I think if nothing else, at the end of each year when the school starts thinking about their budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| if they were getting a report of here's how many in each school district were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| here's how many new permits were issued, so they can start planning three and five years out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| and having those conversations with the county commission where they think they're going to need that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| Just so it's not the last few years, it's just been kind of an emergency upon emergency on top of the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| So anything we can do just to help them be a little bit more proactive as what's coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| I think would help the county, would help the school system, and eventually would help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| I totally agree. We do provide these numbers to them on a yearly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| and they do use them in their projections, but I think it would be beneficial for all of us to better understand how they use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| I know Russ Oaks used to sit up in the balcony at every one of our meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| so he could pay attention to what's coming down the, so I think they're paying attention, I would believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2316)|
| 0:38:45| Okay, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| Thank you. So this is in the northwest county sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| This is the south side of Hardin Valley Road, east of Steel Road and east of North Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| You can see North Campbell Station right here coming into Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| This is the Hardin Valley School's campus, and the subject property is 1.3 acres in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2342)|
| 0:39:11| The applicant is requesting to go on the sector plan from rural commercial land use designation to general commercial land use designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2351)|
| 0:39:23| and they're also asking for rezoning from agriculture to CA general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:31| This is what the present zoning map looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| This is what the present zoning map looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| You can see the existing CA zoning around the intersection with North Campbell Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| This commercial zoning has been here since about the 1950s when the county zoning ordinance was first adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| An extension of CA zoning to the east occurred in 2006 and then again in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2390)|
| 0:39:59| This is the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| So we can see the planned growth area includes the area around the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| We know that the growth plan is a bit dated and across the road from Hardin Valley is the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:18| And although it's in the rural area, it's well served by utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| You can see the sewer and water lines in this area currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| And this is what our sector plan looks like for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| The commercial zoning is shown as rural commercial in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| and the Northwest County Sector Plan acknowledged that this was in the rural area, so we showed this as rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2441)|
| 0:40:53| And this is the aerial, so you can see the site is directly across from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| You can see the 2020 aerial, the commercial building activity underway across from the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2457)|
| 0:41:06| And this is a photo that we took just a couple of weeks ago when we were out doing a field visit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| looking southeast at the existing CA zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| At the right, you see the commercial development in the foreground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| and the consolidated access point at the area around the Still Road intersection that's currently under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| This is looking south at the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| This is a vet clinic that was recently approved in the CA zoning district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| and about where this fire hydrant is and the construction equipment you see is the general area of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2494)|
| 0:41:46| And this is a photo that we took just a couple of weeks ago when we were out doing a field visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| And about where this fire hydrant is and the construction equipment you see is the general area of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2512)|
| 0:42:00| So the staff recommendation is to deny GC because the Sector Plan currently designates this area as rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2520)|
| 0:42:08| and it recommends rural commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| The table here for the land use classifications identified in the Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| but on the next slide I'll provide a little bit more in-depth comparison between the zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2538)|
| 0:42:26| So what you're seeing here is a comparison between the standards for the CA zone versus the CR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2546)|
| 0:42:33| The biggest difference is that with the rural commercial zone, landscaping is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| and there is a maximum building size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| and other standards that are intended to retain the rural character of areas with commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2561)|
| 0:42:51| And just out of interest, if you want to see the 1950s map, you can see where this commercial zoning started out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2571)|
| 0:43:05| And this was before the Pellissippi Parkway was constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| and then in the 1960s, I guess the Pellissippi Parkway is already shown at least on the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| and you can still see the commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| And then the orange area is the industrial area where the schools now are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2597)|
| 0:43:25| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Can you go back like four slides? I think there was one on there where you had rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| There. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| Now rural commercial down here, let's see, I was trying to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| With goods and services that meet day-to-day agricultural-related needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| Is that the lower left corner? Is that what the rural commercial...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| That is the description of the rural commercial land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| And that's what...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| For the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Okay, and that's what we feel like is appropriate here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| Well, I will say that we are a little challenged by the growth policy plan in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2643)|
| 0:44:11| There are more utilities along Hardin Valley now than there were in 2001 when the growth plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2651)|
| 0:44:23| I just think that we hear every month from the residents in Hardin Valley that traffic is intolerable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| it's overwhelmed with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| There's a food city and two schools across the street from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2673)|
| 0:44:40| I think it's a three-lane road, and yet we're leaving this as rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2680)|
| 0:44:46| And it just doesn't job anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| We've got to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| I mean, this is not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| This is just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| To me, it doesn't make sense, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| I just think we need to really consider the fact that that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| You know, if what all the neighbors say is true, and it's a booming, huge area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| then we don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| We need to consider general commercial and let there become a center to that area down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| that we can concentrate or allow more commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| Can you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| I want to pick up on that, because the next slide, I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| I was gleaning from that that here are the big differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| And it seemed like the big difference is that rural commercial simply requires some additional stewardship of that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2729)|
| 0:45:38| via landscaping, et cetera, but the general allowances are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Is that incorrect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| I think that's a correct characterization of the rural commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| So how is that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| That doesn't seem to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| I don't understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| The rural commercial zone in the previous slide, it says that it's designed for retail businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:46:04| that cater to an agricultural-type use, and it just seems like it's a more restrictive classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| Sorry, let me highlight this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| This is actually the land use plan, so this is the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| and it does talk about goods and services that meet day-to-day needs and agricultural-related needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| So this is what the land use plan shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| And then these are the zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| So staff is recommending rural commercial zoning, which is recommended by the rural commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2791)|
| 0:46:40| This is the primary difference between rural commercial and CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| There are just additional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| Okay, but I think to Scott's point, look under the CR rural commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| It very specifically says, provides the opportunity to locate limited retail and service uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| It doesn't say that in the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| So what is defined under that limited retail and service uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| So you can see the uses permitted on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| I will say the CR zone district is a much newer zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| Like we saw, the CA zone district has been in Knox County since the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| So when you look at it, you'll see everything from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| like haberdasheries and other uses that aren't really commonplace anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| whereas the CR zone district actually uses the NACIS codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| and lists all retail uses that fall under NACIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| So if you just went and looked at all the permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2859)|
| 0:47:45| you'll actually see that there are more permitted uses in the CR zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| explicitly permitted, I should say, than in the CA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| Okay, so I'm just thinking out loud now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| So if they're wanting to go in and, say, put in, I hate to use the term strip mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| but, you know, a building that would be larger than 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| that may have five or six shops, they couldn't do that currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:09| because they would be limited in that one building of no more than 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| You mean if they extended, like, a strip commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Like under the CR, they would be limited in a building size they could put there of 20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| which would limit how many restaurants or businesses could come into that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| versus under the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| They're not constrained by that 20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| which could allow for more commercial development in a smaller footprint area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| than having to continue the sprawl in that rural area with more development in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2916)|
| 0:48:43| Well, I guess the site itself is only 1.13 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| so it's only, you know, a little over 43,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| So a 20,000 square foot building on a 43,000 square foot plus parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| I mean, I think they would be limited by the lot size more than the building size limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2938)|
| 0:49:11| You probably need about three acres for 20,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2951)|
| 0:49:19| So the limitation, when it says the applicant requested CA business zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| and staff recommended CR commercial zone, that he might want to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2965)|
| 0:49:34| You're saying that it's just landscaping, that it says business and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| that are limited to farm products?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Am I reading this wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| Is it limited to farm products?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| It is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2988)|
| 0:49:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| I think everybody's a little bit unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| Can we get some examples of the exclusions on the limited retail sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| So I would say that that's probably not a very accurate description to say it's limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| when you look at the uses within the actual zoning ordinance that are permitted in both of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3012)|
| 0:50:19| One of the instances I can see is that in the CA zone district that that veterinarian clinic is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3019)|
| 0:50:27| it had to come through the use on review process because vet clinics are required to go through use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| in the CA zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| If it had been in the CR zone district, it would not have required a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| I wonder why we put limited in there then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| You got me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| Do we have any rationale as to why the applicant would be seeking CA as opposed to CR?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3048)|
| 0:50:56| Because I'm still like it seems like the CR recommendation makes complete sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| Well, that's what I'm trying to get at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I mean, there has to be something that is not allowed in CR, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| I mean, restaurants, bars, they could go in the – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3068)|
| 0:51:17| Great question for them on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| And then just before we wrap this up, as we're going back and looking through the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| or if we ultimately go to a different overall plan, because all that is zone CA is getting developed commercially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3087)|
| 0:51:37| and it's getting – and it's developed commercially across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| we would never look at a sector plan change for that intersection because it's all zone commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| We would just leave it the way it is because maybe he's just applying for a commercial zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| because he's contiguous with the commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| It's the same owner doing all this stuff, and he's probably just wanting to make sure setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| and if he does something different or whatever, that would be something maybe to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3116)|
| 0:52:05| And I'll just make this my monthly obligatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| The urban growth plan desperately needs to be updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3127)|
| 0:52:20| As you all know, because we've been talking about it, is that we are going to be updating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| And so we are currently underway and hoping to have county commission consider a contract in the next couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| Once it's updated, I'll stop saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| Well, hopefully you all will start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Once that project is underway, you'll receive updates from our staff as well as Jim's staff on how that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:44| That concludes our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Is there anything else that the commissioners would like to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| I have a question on item 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| Next one, Nickel Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| It has to do with sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| If you're leaving the tract of land and look to the left, it looks like there's a blind hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3187)|
| 0:53:15| and I don't know how far away it is or what the sight distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| I looked for the speed limit and couldn't find it on Nickel Road anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| so I didn't know really how far we were looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| But there is, to the left, there's kind of a blind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| There's a rise right there a couple hundred feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3216)|
| 0:53:45| So I was wondering if that had been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| Mr. Reynolds is out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| I'm just going to look over the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| I'm assuming it had been considered as part of the review with engineering staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| And if I'm not able to answer it right now, I'll make sure that we have an answer on Thursday for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| We'll confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Any other questions for staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| We'll be adjourned and see you all Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210810-agenda-review?start=3258)|
