| 0:01:58| say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered. For the Mayor's report, first I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| to recognize, I understand we have Scouts 213 from Washington Pike United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| Is that you there? Would you please stand up? We appreciate you being here tonight. Thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=131)|
| 0:02:16| coming. So I want to remind everybody that the annual State of the City Address is tomorrow at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=136)|
| 0:02:29| noon at Zoo Knoxville. It's tomorrow April 27th at Zoo Knoxville. I'll be talking about progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| and opportunities and challenges across the city and presenting my budget proposal for the 2016 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| 2017 fiscal year. Look forward to seeing all of Council there and of course it is open to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| public as well. Parking will be available in the Zoo parking lot so just follow the signs to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| side entrance. There'll be plenty of people there to show you which way to go. So here's one for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| baseball fans and I know that includes our Council Attorney Rob Frost. This Friday April 29th our City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=179)|
| 0:03:07| Youth Baseball Leagues will kick off their Spring Tournament at Cowswell Park with a special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| beginning at 5 30 p.m. As part of our commitment to the Play Ball Youth Program in conjunction with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| Major League Baseball, y'all might recall we had a little pickup game in the middle of Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=198)|
| 0:03:23| Square a few weeks ago. If you weren't there you can watch it on our Facebook site. So we will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=203)|
| 0:03:32| welcoming former All-Star third baseman and Gold Glove winner Greg Nettles. As Rob can probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| tell you Mr. Nettles is best known for his 10 years with the New York Yankees when he played| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| for two World Series champion teams and one year led the American League in home runs. So come on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| out to see him and then stay to watch some of our local kids compete in a tournament. Again that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| this Friday at 5 30 at Cowswell Park. Will you be there Mr. Frost? Yes and my Yankee loving 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| year old will be there too. There's another great family physical fitness event coming up on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=243)|
| 0:04:09| Saturday May 7th. It's the annual Let's Move event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Victor Ashe Park 4901| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=249)|
| 0:04:17| Bradshaw Road. Our Parks and Recreation Department has been organizing this event for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| now this annual event and with public and private partners across the city. It's a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| for kids and parents to get out get active and learn about exercise nutrition and healthy living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| It is free and open to all and you can find more information at letsmovenox.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| Finally an announcement on behalf of the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| As council members remember last year you asked MPC to look at creating a new mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| mixed use district for the Bearden Village area to accommodate residential and commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| development along Kingston Pike and other commercial corridors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| Gerald Green and his staff have been working hard on that and they will have a public meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| present their proposals next Tuesday May 3rd at 6 p.m. at Bearden United Methodist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| which is 4407 Sutherland Avenue. This will obviously be of great interest to people in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| around Bearden but is also something that could potentially serve as a model for other mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| districts in other parts of the city. So this is something we are seeing more demand for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=327)|
| 0:05:32| from developers and residents alike. The success of all of our downtown development shows that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| people are very attracted to areas that combine residential, office, commercial and retail uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| within a small walkable district. So this meeting next Tuesday is the beginning of a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=345)|
| 0:05:51| to consider how this can work in Bearden so I encourage anyone interested to come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| Again that is 6 p.m. on Tuesday the 3rd at Bearden United Methodist Church 4407 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=356)|
| 0:06:06| That's the end of my report. Vice Mayor Grieve. Thank you Mayor. I have two things I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| bring up. First of all to council you know we have our council retreat on May 7th and the surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| that were sent out I want to report as of five o'clock this afternoon we're only missing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| So whoever that one person is. It was it was we don't know who it is but there's one missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=382)|
| 0:06:32| we would like to have. So who's anonymous. That's right that's right and the other thing Mayor I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| like to bring to council's attention and also the city is that last Wednesday Scenic Knoxville held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| its annual meeting and Mary Tracy president of Scenic America was in town and she not only was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=405)|
| 0:06:53| here to give a talk to Scenic Knoxville but she was also here to present an award to Scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| Knoxville and also to the city of Knoxville. This is really something that not only Scenic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| Knoxville can be proud of but all of us in Knoxville. It's called the Stadford Award and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| there's two things that I'd like if you will bear with me I'd like to read about this. The executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| director from Scenic America sent us this and as I said I'd like to read it. At their recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| meeting in Washington D.C. Scenic America's board of directors voted unanimously to present the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| Stadford Award to Scenic Knoxville in recognition of the group's focused and sustained campaign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=448)|
| 0:07:34| to preserve and enhance scenic beauty in Knoxville and in the county. The board asked Scenic America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| president Mary Tracy to give the award to Scenic Knoxville during her visit to the city on April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| 30th. This is the first time that Scenic America has given the Stadford Award its highest honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=466)|
| 0:07:53| to an affiliate organization. Scenic America board chairman Ronald Lee Fleming said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| by demonstrating that a committed group of citizens can affect positive change in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| community through a shared vision persistence and determination Scenic Knoxville has set a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=484)|
| 0:08:10| gold standard for other scenic organizations and all citizens who care about the way their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| communities look. The Stadford Award is named for former U.S. Senator Robert Stadford of Vermont| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| for his concern for the environment and efforts to strengthen federal highway beautification laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=503)|
| 0:08:29| Previous recipients include our senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| Governor Pete Wilson of California, Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, and U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| Transportation Secretary Rodrigo Pena. Scenic America is the only national non-profit organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| dedicated to preserving and enhancing the scenic character of America's roadways, countrysides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| and communities. And then I'd like to read a brief statement from Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| Through its efforts, Scenic Knoxville in its six short years was able to secure a ban on digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| billboards, a ban on new electronic message centers, and greater restrictions on existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=545)|
| 0:09:11| EMCs in the city. Scenic Knoxville's leadership and advocacy also resulted in the passage of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| new city sign ordinance, which reduced new business sign heights implemented procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| for quicker removal of abandoned signs and maintenance of signs and other significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| changes. Finally, Scenic Knoxville successfully advocated a ban which was passed by county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| commission on any new digital billboards in the county. So, Scenic Knoxville, just to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| everyone know, again, is a grassroots volunteer organization that has done quite a bit of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=577)|
| 0:09:42| for not only itself but also for our city. So, I just wanted to make sure that everyone understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| that the award that was presented to them. So, thank you. Thank you. Councilman Pavlis? Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| you, Mayor. We've got a couple of big events coming up in South Knoxville. The first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| is this weekend. Comcast has a national Comcast Cares Day nationwide, and this is the second year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=598)|
| 0:10:08| in a row that they have chosen South Knoxville to be the recipient. Last year, you will recall that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| the CEO, Neil Smith of Comcast, came in and gave $25,000 to South Knoxville Elementary, which was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| huge, huge thing. But this year, they're coming to the Baker Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=624)|
| 0:10:29| project. It's formerly known as the Wood Property, the 100 acres that they donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=629)|
| 0:10:37| to Legacy Parks, and it's being, of course, programmed through various grants, and Appalachian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=637)|
| 0:10:43| Mountain Bike Club is doing a lot of work there as well. But there'll be 200 Comcast volunteers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=643)|
| 0:10:50| but we still need volunteers from the community to come. They're going to plant 1,000 trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| they're going to clean trails on the urban wilderness, and the Baker Creek Preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| the beds there. So, they're going to do a lot of work. It's located at 3700 Lancaster Drive. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| can go to my website at nickpavlis.com, and it has all the details of that. But it's this weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| and if you want to be there, probably around 8 o'clock to start. And then on May 7th, after I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=676)|
| 0:11:23| to the council retreat, I'll be headed to the festival. And it's a great event. It's a family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| friendly event. It just has all kinds of vendors, crafts, really great food, and most of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=688)|
| 0:11:37| music. They have all kinds of music venues, and it's just generally a crazy night. I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| just a lot of fun. And it's, you know, I forget which year this is. Becky may know, or somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=703)|
| 0:11:50| may know, but we've been doing it a long time. It starts about 11 o'clock, and it goes to whenever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| we're done. So, it's a huge event for South Knoxville, and I urge you to come by. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| ordered good weather, so hopefully it'll be fine. But it's always a very good time, and we hope to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| see you there. Thank you. Mayor Brown. Oh, yes, Mayor. On last Sunday, I was at the Project Grad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| Dinner, where kids from Fulton and Austin East High School were honored, but we, there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| presentation made to Patricia Ribeiro for doing right by kids. And I think we need to recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=741)|
| 0:12:30| that, that she did get an award, and she did not know she was going to receive that award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| But it's an outstanding award that they present every year for a person who has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| something in the community for our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| So, she did receive that award on Sunday from Project Grad. Congratulations, Patricia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=764)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you. You know, her office is right across from mine, and she never even told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=774)|

| 0:20:54| Second. Councilman Pavlis. Yeah, I just couldn't be more excited about this project here. We started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| two years ago. We met and discussed this, and I'm just so happy to see it come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| It's a huge project that really is going to be an asset to the City of Knoxville, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1268)|
| 0:21:16| it continues the $17 million or however many million dollars it ends up being for the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| investment in Cumberland. This is a $45 million project that's private funds. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| it dovetails off, of course, what happened at University Commons, the Hilton Garden Inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| that spent, I think, $7 million, and then we're going to leverage this money. And it's just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| to be a really, really good project. One of the things that really makes me the happiest about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| is the parking situation. They're going to have over 348 spaces for about 600 residents, 138 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1308)|
| 0:21:59| That's a lot of parking. And they had to buy another parcel of land to be able to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| that. So, obviously, they really tried hard to meet a very large problem on UT campus in Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| Sanders, which is parking. And additionally, there'll be 9,000 square feet of retail located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| in the building. The anchor retail tenant will be First Tennessee Bank. They'll be there and occupy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| 3,000 square foot of the ground floor there. The rest of it, that's up to them, whatever they bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| in, but they'll have 30 designated parking spaces for the retail as well. So that's very good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| again, helping ease the parking situation over there. And bringing that many people in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| it's great that they have provided this kind of work of parking for the tenants and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| hopefully the people that'll come in for the retail. But I know they've worked really hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| with about every department of the city, with KUB, and they've made, you know, changes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| the way. And they've just been really good partners. And I know they'll continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| great partners with the city of Knoxville. So, you know, hopefully this will, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| get you all's blessings. I appreciate you all waiting two weeks. I was out of town on business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| travel at the last meeting where I was supposed to be hurt for the first reading. So I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| you all's diligence and patience with that. So that's all I have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you. Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you, Mayor. Nick, I agree. They have worked on this for some time, and I know they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| kept us informed, or some of us informed anyway, of what the situation is. And in fact, we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| meeting this afternoon where we talked about not only the project, but also the materials that go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| in the project. And one of the things that I think is real positive about this is that this is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| the first projects to really do the Cumberland Avenue form-based code. And I've assured a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| of constituents who have called me that this project is not going to look like the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| building that's on Cumberland Avenue. That's been a concern I know that several people have talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| about. So I have their assurances in terms of the materials that are going to be used and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| design. And unlike you, Nick, I think this is really a real kickstart for Cumberland and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| what we're going to see, you know, in addition to what's going on there. So I'm excited about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| also on that. Thank you. All right, thank you. So Mr. Stiles, Mr. Seymour signed up. Is that only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1463)|

| 0:24:38| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902. I'd really like to turn it over to Mr. Stiles with Collegiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| Development. There have been some newspaper articles about the project, but since we are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| TV here, I think it would be helpful if the public got one more overview of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| if that's all right. Without objection, go right ahead. That's fine. Please state your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1497)|

| 0:25:18| renderings that I figured I'd... First off, I just wanted to say thank you, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1518)|
| 0:25:28| members of Council, for your potential support for this project. We couldn't be more excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| about this project as well. We've been working 18 months, 20 months on this project with city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| trying to mold it into the type of project that the form-based code really has from an intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1539)|
| 0:25:48| perspective. We really see this project as an economic engine for the district and serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| as a model for future development as well. At Collegiate Development Group, our mission is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| deliver an unmatched experience around cutting-edge properties and premier locations. I think what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| has been developed with this Cumberland Avenue project, it's really transitioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1566)|
| 0:26:14| Cumberland Avenue into a premier development location. We could not be more excited and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1574)|
| 0:26:24| enthusiastic about what city staff and everyone has done with Cumberland Avenue. I can't wait to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| see six years down the road and see the amount of development and how pedestrian-friendly and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1590)|
| 0:26:35| how active that area is going to be. I think Nick really sort of covered some of the overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| 138 units, 9,000 to 10,000 square feet of retail, 348 parking spots, six stories on Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1601)|
| 0:26:49| Avenue, eight stories on Lake. We're requesting a 15-year tax pilot. A lot of that is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1609)|
| 0:27:00| because of the large amount of parking that we're providing, the existing soil conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| the topography on the site. As well, there's two resolutions here. The second one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| requesting air rights. We're bridging over the alleyway on a portion of our building from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| residential perspective and a parking perspective. We'll be bridging over that alleyway and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1641)|

| 0:27:43| Watch what you say. I just want to make a comment. I'm sure occasionally the city gets calls with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| complaints about Cumberland Avenue traffic, etc., but I get calls quite frequently from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1670)|
| 0:27:58| looking at Knoxville for development purposes and in particular the university area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1678)|
| 0:28:05| One of the reasons they give for being interested in Knoxville and in particular Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| is the investment the city of Knoxville has made and is making in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| Developers like to go into an area where the city is an active participant in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| process and what you all have done with Cumberland Avenue is helping that development and has gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1707)|
| 0:28:35| out in the world and has made people interested in Knoxville who may not otherwise have noticed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| So thank you all for that. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Mayor Brown. Those units, will they be geared primarily towards students or others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1728)|
| 0:28:56| So most of the units are going to be four-bedroom and five-bedroom units catered towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| the students. We're not restricting any type of tenant, so most of our marketing will be towards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| the students, graduate, undergraduate, medical students. That is the target market based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1748)|
| 0:29:15| location. And what price range are you looking at? Our price range is going to start anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| from $675 up to $750. I see. Thank you. Vice Mayor Grave. Thank you, Mayor. One of the things I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1760)|
| 0:29:30| that you mentioned, this is a pilot and I had asked Dr. Lyons that for the general public if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1770)|
| 0:29:35| he would just give a layman's term on both the pilot and the TIFs since we were working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| both of those. And so if he would do that, I think it would be helpful. I'd be glad to. I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| the opportunity. We'll try to put this in layperson terms as much as we can. I'll speak quickly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| well. It could go on a long time with this. Pilots and TIFs are two mechanisms that we at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1791)|
| 0:30:00| use that provided to us by the state to participate in projects that we think are in the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| interest to occur but otherwise cannot occur because they just are financially upside down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| or the numbers don't work and we end up facing a gap. And this is a perfect example of such a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| project. A pilot, and the pilot stands for payment in lieu of taxes, amounts to the cities keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1817)|
| 0:30:26| the taxes at their present rate. And that is done through the work with the Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Development Board and that allows the developer to enjoy the benefits of having that lesser tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1831)|
| 0:30:39| burden for a number of years and then not having to build that in with his expenses in his pro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1839)|
| 0:30:45| forma. So with the lower tax burden that the developer has not being hit with the burden of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| much higher taxes, that project can then work. Now that's accomplished in a way that gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1851)|
| 0:30:59| rationale to the payment in lieu of taxes and that is by state constitution. And you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| understand why this is. Cities are not allowed to just set differential tax rates. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| can you imagine if we were just asked to set the tax rate here and the tax rate there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| So the way that this is accomplished is literally the property is deeded over to the Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| Development Board after a process as we are going through. The Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| is a public entity, is therefore not taxable. So that property therefore comes off the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| So what has to happen is we have to go through a process like this to establish a payment in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| lieu of taxes that to the developer works very much like taxes and we can set that rate. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| that rate stands for a number of years. So basically a pilot is a way to use our tax powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1900)|
| 0:31:50| to, and I think I want to stress this, just not take advantage of the increased taxes for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| but have the advantages of the rest of the development. Now moving over to TIF, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| tax increment financing and that's done with our partners at KCDC and once in a while in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| situations through the IDB. And the way a TIF works is very different. The people who end up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| the building pay, and usually there's been a transfer of ownership, pay full taxes. They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| no idea that a TIF is in place on a building. Those taxes go to retire a loan, a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1938)|
| 0:32:26| loan that is used to close the gap to which I referred earlier, that development gap. So in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| that case taxes are paid but those taxes are directed to repair a loan that enabled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1951)|
| 0:32:37| project to take place. And because of that, that involves county and city taxes, both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1957)|
| 0:32:45| city council and county commission have to participate. Back to a pilot, because either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1965)|
| 0:32:49| body has the power to remove an entity from the tax rolls by giving it to the respective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| IDBs, either council or commission can establish a pilot. You may have noticed that county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| commission voted on a pilot for Marble Alley yesterday. That will not come to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| They have the power through their IDB to take it off the tax rolls. So those are the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| mechanisms we had. They have provided to us by the state and they've proven as you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1989)|
| 0:33:16| to be we think incredibly successful in enabling the public interest to be advanced and projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| to occur. And we treat them both the same way. We have to assure ourselves the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| cannot occur without them. And secondly, we have to be assured that the project is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| fact in the public interest that justifies this type of action. One last thing, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2012)|
| 0:33:41| you Christy. The TIF, the major difference of TIF as we have used many times in our discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2021)|
| 0:33:50| with you, requires that an immediate payment be made to the city, an increased payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2030)|
| 0:33:58| that covers our debt service. So that's why when we do a TIF there's immediate dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| coming in. With a pilot that is not the case, though in some cases we do have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| to set those payments to allow those things to happen. Thank you. Councilman Dallivan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| As long as you're giving us that background, Mr. Lyons, maybe you can tell us why we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| stairstep that payment in lieu of taxes. Obviously in the initial period during construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| and early tenanting, the developer is going to have the most severe impact in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| lack of funds. But five and ten years down the road, you could see where their income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| stream should settle down. Why don't we stairstep, why doesn't Knoxville stairstep the payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| in lieu of taxes over time so that they would pay a greater amount as the project ages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| That's a very good question, Councilman Dallivan, and one that we have discussed using on occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2093)|
| 0:35:00| I think the simple answer is there is a certain amount that the entire development needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| close a gap. And if we stairstep it, it just would mean we'd have to increase the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| of years over which that went. I mean, one way or the other, those dollars that we always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| attempt to make those dollars no more than they need to be, if we had the full payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2117)|
| 0:35:22| for X years, we would have to have a full plus a partial payment for X plus five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| or so. And it's been our sense that we would rather have these have shorter periods and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| go off and fully return. But that is a strategy to use, and I would say in some cases that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| may be one we want to use. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay, Council, we have a motion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| a second. Is there any other discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| have it and so ordered. 11F as a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an air rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| easement with Collegiate Development LLC to allow a building connection over an unnamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| alley at 1830 Cumberland Avenue. Second. Councilman Dallivan. Yes, if I could ask the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| to return to the podium for a second. The air rights issue that's before us now, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2164)|
| 0:36:11| alley will still be functional, but you will have the ability to run cars or whatever it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2171)|
| 0:36:17| is over to the other side of the street. Is that what's going on? Correct. The alley will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| stay a public alley. And you said it would be 16 feet high and 25 feet wide in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| of the, I guess, the space that's remaining under this structure? Correct. Our air rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| will be above that. Okay. So 25 feet wide and 16 feet clear within the slope changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2192)|
| 0:36:42| from west to east. And at no point will that height of our building be less than 16 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2202)|
| 0:36:51| So there will always be 16 feet clear. So people that depend on deliveries and whatnot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| will continue to have that access? Correct. Thank you. Thank you. Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2221)|

| 0:37:55| and extending the date of completion. So moved. Second. Councilman Delivante. Yeah, if Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Hagerman could just address this briefly. This is the construction part as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| the design part we just passed. We are trying to keep, what, a sinkhole or some other area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2285)|
| 0:38:12| from disrupting the trail? Would you just tell us what you're trying to accomplish by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| these contracts? I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the City. This particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| section of Greenway, part of it started sliding down the bluff. I mean, it's perched on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| side of the bluff and it kind of split in half up the middle and part of it was moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| down. So it was more than just a localized problem. There was a sinkhole that opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| up when they were doing drilling for the foundations to hook it into the bedrock. So you're stabilizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| the bank? Is that what you're doing? Well, stabilizing the whole bank and a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| But the original intent was to bore piling down to bedrock. And they couldn't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2336)|
| 0:39:05| And for part of the site, we couldn't find it. So the other part, we basically stabilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| the bank rather than creating a foundation to bedrock for the Greenway. Just a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| engineering solution for the same basic problem of how do we have a good stable trail area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| there. Right. Thank you. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2365)|

| 0:41:23| down. I'm going to call on you. You have up to five minutes to speak and I will, we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2483)|
| 0:41:31| that you state your name and address and we appreciate you being here. First is Rhonda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| Gallman. She was here. Is Rhonda still here? Okay, we'll move on. Sam Emmons. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2495)|
| 0:41:50| for being here. Thank you. My name is Sam Emmons. My address is 301 Woodlawn Pike, apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2510)|
| 0:42:03| J1, Knoxville 37920. I'm a graduate student at UT and I've actually only lived here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2523)|
| 0:42:12| Knoxville for about three years now. The topic I want to talk about tonight is just more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| general. Like all of you, I have a desire for the good of Knoxville, for its peace, for its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2539)|
| 0:42:30| prosperity. I know that you, the mayor, the council, city officials, have done a lot for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2550)|
| 0:42:39| these purposes here in Knoxville. You spend time thinking about what's best, what's fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| what's economical for the city. You have a lot of experience working out ideas and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2568)|
| 0:42:57| decisions. So thank you for the effort, the efforts that you have made and continually make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2577)|
| 0:43:04| for the city. Tonight I'm going to discuss the topic of wisdom, kind of general, and how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2584)|
| 0:43:15| affects the city. I know that I need more. We probably all need more. And so I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2595)|
| 0:43:23| some rhetorical questions. I know you can't answer questions, but that can be useful. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| can hopefully get us thinking about it in constructive ways together. Then I will propose a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| couple of ideas and some application. So I hope this is thought-provoking and helpful. What is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2615)|
| 0:43:44| wisdom? Is it the ability and understanding to make informed, effective, practical decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2624)|
| 0:43:55| Is it more than that? Does having wisdom affect our lives, our character? And once we know what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2635)|
| 0:44:06| is, where do we find it? Where do we find it? Do we just sit and think long enough and then what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| think of is wisdom, what we come up with is wisdom? Does culture have it figured out? Culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| right, says we have all the answers. Does culture have it figured out? Can we just pick it up from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2660)|
| 0:44:26| our favorite writers, bloggers, commentators? And how do we know that the sources we trust for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2666)|
| 0:44:35| wisdom actually have enough of it themselves? Is there a source of wisdom outside of ourselves and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2675)|
| 0:44:45| what we can conjure up as a culture? What might be an example of helpful wisdom for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| Proverbs 15.1, Proverbs from the Bible. It says, a soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2693)|
| 0:45:02| stirs up anger. Pretty simple on face value, but imagine with me if that influenced our city more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2702)|
| 0:45:11| What if it influenced your relationship with your spouse more? I'm married, so I feel free to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2711)|
| 0:45:20| What about your kids? What about colleagues or people you just can't stand? What if that influenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2720)|
| 0:45:30| those relationships? So this proverb sounds nice, but how can we actually do that? How can we respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| well? We know there's some wisdom in it, but we may not always care. Sometimes we just don't feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2738)|
| 0:45:47| being patient, even though we know the positive impact it would have in our city and our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| and with our friends. We need help with this. Where does that help come from? Towards the end of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2755)|
| 0:46:06| letter called Galatians in the New Testament, it says, the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2766)|
| 0:46:14| kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against these things, there's no law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| That first part about the spirit means that God can give us the help we need with these characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| with this wisdom. We see the benefits and worth of what's on this list right away. We know it's valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2789)|
| 0:46:39| So why do we doubt maybe that God might be the source of these things that we know we need? We feel that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| What if these characteristics permeated the streets of Knoxville? What kind of changes would we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2806)|
| 0:46:55| for the people, everyday people, for the people who are hurting, for the rich, the poor, everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| Good timer. This changes my perspective on what people of Knoxville need the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| So I hope this is inspiring and challenging to think about. Thank you for the work that you all put in for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| Knoxville's Good. Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| Thank you, Mr. Emmons. Next is Pat Ramston. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2839)|
| 0:47:36| Thank you for allowing me to speak. My name is Patricia Ramston, and my address is 8209 Fox Lake Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2856)|
| 0:47:46| Last night, I had the privilege of feeding about 100 homeless people underneath the bridge who had no place to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2866)|
| 0:47:57| and nowhere to eat. And over the course of the evening, I heard stories about a young couple who had just lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2877)|
| 0:48:09| their baby and were heartbroken. I heard several stories that were very joyous of people who had finally found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2889)|
| 0:48:20| jobs because they had been working very hard at that. I heard stories from people who knew that by the end of the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2900)|
| 0:48:31| their homes would be destroyed. I listened. I hugged. I sympathized. I gave out batteries and toilet paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2911)|
| 0:48:45| It was a privilege to walk with them. They are my friends and your constituents. Too often, people think that those who live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2925)|
| 0:49:04| on the street are there because somehow they want to be there. Trust me, that adventure wears off after about the second day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2944)|
| 0:49:17| They're there because they have nowhere else to go. They are also there trying to get out of the situations that life has given them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2957)|
| 0:49:33| They work very hard, as I said, at finding some place to work. People who go through our food line are hospital workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2973)|
| 0:49:48| They work in parking lots. They work in fast food restaurants. They have a variety of jobs that they have been able to find in a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=2988)|
| 0:50:00| that they enjoy as we enjoy it. But everything is more difficult for them. Being clean is more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3000)|
| 0:50:15| You have to plan going to the bathroom an hour or so in advance in order to find a toilet. You have to plan whether you're going to eat or buy medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3015)|
| 0:50:34| You have to plan how you're going to get to work. Many of these people walk literally two or three miles to get from their camp to the place where they are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3034)|
| 0:50:47| That's going to be made more difficult, I understand, because transportation from the CARM area will be discontinued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3047)|
| 0:50:58| At least that's my understanding. It's more miles for them to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3058)|
| 0:51:06| My goal in speaking to you is to bring back to your mind the fact that these are human beings. These are daughters and sons, sisters and brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3066)|
| 0:51:30| When they are told that they have to be evicted because their homes will be destroyed, they're not given any option as to where else to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3090)|
| 0:51:44| And whenever I called to try to find what options were out there, my calls were not returned. The bulldozers just showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3104)|
| 0:51:58| They're not going to disappear. Our goal, as I'm sure is your goal, is to help them the best we can to find the solutions and to protect their rights as we protect the rights of all citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3118)|
| 0:52:21| So I would ask that you consider the Bill of Rights that we submitted several months ago. If you would like for us to come and give you more information in small groups or individually, we would be more than happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3141)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3161)|
| 0:52:45| Next is Travis Underwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| I don't believe Travis is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Not here? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| Next is Teddy Strunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3171)|
| 0:53:06| Hello, sir. Thank you for being here. Name and address for the record, and I'll set the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| Yes, ma'am. My name is Teddy Strunk, and I have no address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Okay. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| And I'd like to thank this lady that just spoke, because I have razor blades because of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3195)|
| 0:53:22| I want to start off by saying I love Knoxville, Tennessee, and have always loved Knoxville, Tennessee. It's a wonderful place. I'm a Christian. I love Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3202)|
| 0:53:36| But there's injustice going on in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| And as a two-year homeless person who's living in the street in graduate school, studying to be a mental health counselor to help these very people that I live amongst, in 2014, I was walking down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3219)|
| 0:54:04| I was not aware of open container laws or anything in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| I was walking down the street with an open can, a 24-ounce can of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| A police officer came around the block, saw me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| I didn't know the law, but I knew that it would be trouble with me having a beer can in my hand, so I set it down on a wall, a concrete wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3259)|
| 0:54:31| He therefore went around the block and came around and asked me, he said, that's your can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3271)|
| 0:54:38| And I said, yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| He got really, really smart with me and said, here, you have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| You can take an open container, a PI, public intoxication, or criminal littering, or littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3287)|
| 0:55:00| It wasn't criminal at the time, just littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| And I thought for a moment, and I've never been given a choice by an officer before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| I thought I would take the lesser charge of littering, because I'm going to be applying for a license to be a therapist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3308)|
| 0:55:18| And I wouldn't want any alcohol or drug-related charges to keep me from getting a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| So I took littering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| He laughed and said that was the higher charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| He said nothing of me having to go to be booked in to jail for a littering charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3331)|
| 0:55:39| So I didn't take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I thought it was a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| That's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| I didn't take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| I didn't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| I went to jail for criminal littering after a failure to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| In 2015, I was in Crutch Park off of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3353)|
| 0:56:03| I paid a taxi to bring a girl down, a friend of mine, that I had known for several months, to meet me at Crutch Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3363)|
| 0:56:15| She'd been watching a football game, and she was very intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| I told her I would take care of her, and that she proceeded to be sick in the middle of Crutch Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3380)|
| 0:56:30| Three police officers approached and said, oh, honey, do you need a ride home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3390)|
| 0:56:38| And real, like, sweety, sweety stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| I questioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| I hadn't had a thing to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| I was not intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| I questioned it, and I went to jail for public intoxication, being therefore sober.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3406)|
| 0:56:55| I got into the paddy wagon, and I told the officer, he said, Teddy, I know you're a Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3415)|
| 0:57:06| I'm a Christian, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| I said, well, this is a terrible injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| I said, I hadn't had a thing to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| I just questioned why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| I was just questioning why they would offer a ride home to a girl that was on a date with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| All I did was question, and I went to jail for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| Anyway, there are injustices just because we don't have a place to live at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3450)|
| 0:57:38| As of June, coming up June 10, 2016, I will not be homeless anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| My financial aid kicks back in, and I will buy a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| Again, I just want you to consider the human rights of people who don't have a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3469)|
| 0:57:57| who don't have any place to go, but wherever they go, they're going to be harassed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3477)|
| 0:58:03| because really, it's trespassing anywhere they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| You can always charge them with trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| I saw a charge the other day where a person was like 50 yards off the walkway and got a ticket for jaywalking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3491)|
| 0:58:20| I'm wondering if they don't go to get booked if that person's going to jail for jaywalking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| Anyway, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| God bless Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| I would like to make sure you are aware, and anybody, that if you have complaints against a police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| that we do have the Police Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| We encourage people to contact them if you would like the case reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| Okay, next is Martha Allred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3528)|
| 0:58:54| Martha Allred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3534)|
| 0:59:08| Thank you, ma'am, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| State your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Martha Allred, homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Okay, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| I'm a member of the homeless collective, and we were wondering why haven't y'all done the Bill of Rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3555)|
| 0:59:28| Ma'am, the purpose of this is for you to speak in public forum to counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| It's not a question and answer, but you can speak to people individually after the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3573)|
| 0:59:42| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3584)|
| 0:59:49| Next is Robert Buford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3589)|
| 0:59:58| Hi, I'm Robert Buford, address 2104 Washington Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| And I want to start off by kissing a little tail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Definitely want to thank you guys for continuing to make Knoxville beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| I've been gone for, I guess I was gone for probably ten years in San Diego and moved back here to take care of my elderly mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3614)|
| 1:00:23| But since I've been back, I've been working in the community a little bit with some people that I actually went to school with, grew up with as a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3623)|
| 1:00:33| And we're just noticing a lot of things that kind of have gotten swayed to one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| And I guess with all the violence that we've been seeing here lately, it's kind of standing out a little more because we see KPD out a lot more now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3641)|
| 1:00:51| And seeing them out and about, we're noticing that the demographics of our police department is severely swayed one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3651)|
| 1:01:00| And being that Knoxville is supposedly, according to suburbanstats.org, 76% Caucasian, 17% African American, 4% Hispanic, and 3% other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3660)|
| 1:01:17| But yet we have a police department that is over 93% Caucasian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| And I guess giving light to, I guess what kind of brought a light to me is when our former deputy chief of police just got promoted on another assignment in Alabama.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3682)|
| 1:01:37| So therefore dealing another blow to the police department in diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| And not only diversity in ethnic, color, but also in sex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| Because we have very few women police officers also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| So we were actually just going through the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| And if I looked at the county, the sheriff's department is even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| But I saw that we currently have 93% white police force, 6% African American or black, and 1% labeled as other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3720)|
| 1:02:12| So that kind of breaks it down into 384 Caucasian officers, 23 African American, and 6 other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| And I didn't go into the detail of whether they were male or female, but I'm quite sure that there was a disparity also in female officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3739)|
| 1:02:32| So what we in the community would like to request, if someone would actually be able to contact us through the alliance house, to possibly get a community liaison that could possibly work on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| Because we do. We do have kids in school, all of our schools, Fulton, Austin, East, Central, West, on this side of town, Carter, that do honor and support law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3757)|
| 1:03:02| But we're not getting to them early enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| And I do see on the city of Knoxville website that our kids are able to become cadets between the ages of 18 and 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3785)|
| 1:03:16| So that they can actually get to know what KPD is all about, what policing and law enforcement is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| But I don't think we're doing a good job at approaching those kids and getting them interested in being a part of upholding the law versus violating and breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| And then at age 21, I saw on the website that they were actually eligible for the police academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3809)|
| 1:03:39| So just in the fourth site, just trying to see if the city council would basically be willing to not only create a community liaison person to kind of kick that program off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3819)|
| 1:03:46| or trying to integrate our high school students, maybe 10th, 11th grade, and becoming cadets and learning more about law enforcement and getting them more in line with wanting to be in that profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3826)|
| 1:04:08| And that's all I have. But I definitely thank you for your time and cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you, sir. I would encourage you to contact Officer Fred Kimber in Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| It is his responsibility as we recruit for our next academy, police academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| He is actively recruiting African American and other minority candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| I strongly encourage you to touch base with him or to leave your number with Deputy Chief Holliday and he can get that, your contact information to Officer Kimber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3870)|
| 1:04:37| And council, as you all know, this is an issue that we have been concerned about for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| And we have an opportunity with the new training academy that we are starting to recruit more African American and other minority candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3884)|
| 1:04:54| And it's something we just had a meeting about the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| And we are going to be looking for when the applications go up, when the recruitment starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3900)|
| 1:05:06| and encourage people that you might know to apply for these positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| There will be a lot of people applying for the jobs, but we are actively recruiting African American and other minority candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| So please be in touch with Officer Kimber. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| Next we have Alex Kaplan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3925)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you for being here. You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| Alex Kaplan, 901 Mount Castle Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| I am a student at the University of Tennessee and I am also involved with the Peace and Justice Center here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| The latest data into the public intoxication arrest records show that 46% of public intoxication arrests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| since January of 2015 were homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| Conversely, only 7% were under 25 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| This is a highly disproportional rate of arrests when comparing homeless versus 25 years and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| In addition to public intoxication, intoxicated college students walk up and down Cumberland every night, especially on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| These students are clearly intoxicated and are causing large disturbances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| This disproportionate number of arrests demonstrates how the homeless are being discriminated against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| and stress the need for the Homeless Bill of Rights in order to protect homeless people from the discriminatory practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| of the police to target the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| The people the officers choose to arrest for public intoxication is completely up to the officer's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| The officer only has to believe the person is intoxicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4013)|
| 1:06:59| A breathalyzer test is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| As a student and a citizen of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| I feel it is an embarrassment that the city would rather talk about smokers and barbecue instead of people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| Next we have Mr. Lincoln Lincoln.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4043)|
| 1:07:35| Thank you for being here, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4055)|
| 1:07:44| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4064)|
| 1:07:51| I'm here to continue my screed of last week involving PMUs, no barbecue, smoke intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4071)|
| 1:07:58| I get to the point of telling the council that the revised transit plan for the Knox trolley system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4078)|
| 1:08:08| underserves a population or two or three in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| The most specific one that I want to talk about is Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| The trolley route that Summit Towers will be on effective May 2, called commonly the Red Route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| will be two rotations of a very lightly used parking lot in the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4106)|
| 1:08:32| and at the same time will service Summit Towers seven times in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| I find this to be an unreasonable use of city resources and public transportation funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4118)|
| 1:08:46| This is a great reduction. It's a reduction of 80% from the previous service given to Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| Last week 100% disabled people and or elderly or both and a 54% minority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| There are 386 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4139)|
| 1:09:05| Currently the CAT plan, which is to be published in the next day or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| apparently CAT has made some arrangements with other populations that were affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| After the drastic reduction to zero got additional service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| I'm told the Homeless Coalition received some assurances from CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| that their being cut out of transit would be fixed using some other measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4169)|
| 1:09:34| that leaves Summit Towers, which as I mentioned last week after four letters to the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| and a petition, I personally received a reply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| I have not, however, gotten replies from our email campaign to the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| penned by Ms. Dee Disler, the manager of CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| I have read closely her reply and unfortunately find many inaccuracies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4196)|
| 1:10:02| many misleading statements and factually incorrect information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4202)|
| 1:10:09| I feel this needs to be addressed, hopefully on a current basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4209)|
| 1:10:16| I think we're entitled to dialogue and maybe an opening has been created for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| I certainly hope so, maybe even this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| This trolley plan is, remember, publicly financed. It's city financed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| After my analysis of that plan, I am a trolley rider. I live, work and play downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| I know where people go and when they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| This plan looks to me like it was designed by people who don't live, work and play downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4236)|
| 1:10:44| It looks like a plan that is designed to move trolleys around Knoxville, not move people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| People is the intent, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| Additionally, CAT has proposed to build a $200,000 plus or minus walkway from Summit Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| to a newly established trolley stop on Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| I've calculated the cost of running trolleys, the system cost and the cost of serving Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4268)|
| 1:11:15| The break-even for an expenditure of that nature is over seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4275)|
| 1:11:21| In addition, it would produce a longer walk for disabled people to the trolley stop if they can walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4281)|
| 1:11:30| and destroy a little bit of green space that we have on Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| It does not even and cannot address the changes in grade between Summit Hill and the building on Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4294)|
| 1:11:42| I'm hoping that even though this plan is going into effect, there are lots of ways to fix this and make it more equitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4302)|
| 1:11:50| I intend to find a reasonable end and fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4310)|
| 1:11:56| I've tried and tried and tried with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| I've tried with city government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| There are other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| I'm tired of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| I want to see equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| I want to see fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| I want to see people served, and they're not being served presently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| Options include sending this package to the federal government, asking them for help, the FTA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| They participate in sending the city and CAT funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| I don't think that this plan meets legal standards, moral standards, or ethical standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4345)|
| 1:12:33| And I thank you for your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| Back to Rhonda Gallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| Ms. Gallman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| Rhonda Gallman, 2431 Hoyt Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| I actually didn't want to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| I was a little tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| The things I would like to address today is that, as we know, there has been another murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| I had addressed the community as well as you all about the strategies that we need to take for our communities to prevent crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4383)|
| 1:13:11| and other senseless deaths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Unfortunately, at this time, I haven't heard any stone strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| No one has responded to me reaching out to them, especially with some of the leaders in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| If anyone is really, truly serious about ending some of the crime and trying to come up with some solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4404)|
| 1:13:32| again, I say we're failing to address the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| The community has a lot of those answers, but yet they're not included in a lot of things that are going on with the decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4415)|
| 1:13:44| I sat in on the presentation of the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| It's a beautiful idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| I think it's very attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| However, it's not going to be ready until 2017, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| So here we are preparing ourselves for another summer with nothing to do, nothing for the children, nothing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4436)|
| 1:14:04| I would hope and think that the city would be more concerned and more involved in pouring funding into some of the establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4444)|
| 1:14:12| that are taking place, even though we have a few, say, for instance, Unique Academy, the Alliance House, Souls Magazines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4452)|
| 1:14:21| those different types of organizations that we already have in play now that are small and need some growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| to give these kids something to do, some jobs, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| I am questioning, along with some of the people in the community, how the plan came up for the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| Some of the people were not involved in it and would like to find out more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| There are some other places that could use some of the assistance as well, and that would be the parks and recreations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| and some of the centers that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| However, I find it quite odd that the Lonsdale community doesn't have anything right now for their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| seeing that Zavion has made the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| His name has been dropped in on the scene just about for any and everything that's going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| and you would think that his community would have something for this summer for the youth to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| somewhere to go, something to do, because their center, too, is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| So I am urging the councilmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| I would like to actually meet everyone one-on-one, have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| If you all agree, I would love to meet with you and discuss some of the strategies that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| and have taken on as an ear to hear from some of the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| But I would encourage you all to actually listen to the community, and you, too, get more involved with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| because it's their problem, and they can help on solving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| They have the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| So as far as tonight, that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| I was asked to ask a few things from some other groups and organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| I'm really worn out today, but right now I'm really saddened by the news of this because before this happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| I reached out to some of the pastors to actually work on some preventive measures before this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4561)|
| 1:16:08| And what happened is, again, is another repeat cycle of let's have a prayer walk, let's put an end to this evil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4568)|
| 1:16:17| But before it began, those things should have been in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| and we should have been engaging with the community because the pastors are not engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| It's not their fault, but that's where the masses of the people are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| so that we can work on some better solutions to get this resolved so no one else loses a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| Thank you all, and you have a wonderful evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| Council, there's nobody else signed up for public forum, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160426?start=4603)|
