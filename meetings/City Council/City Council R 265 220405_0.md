| 0:02:31| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| It's nice to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Time now for my Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=153)|
| 0:02:35| And I want to start off by thanking everyone who came out to the City's Neighborhood Conference this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| We had hundreds of people register for the event, and we have been getting a lot of positive feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| So thank you to Dr. Lomax and the Office of Community Empowerment and Office of Neighborhood Empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| and all the people who helped make it such a successful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| And also a big congratulations to the Diana Kahn Good Neighbor of the Year, Debbie Smith from West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=174)|
| 0:03:00| We appreciate all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| So this is also just a shout-out to the Community Empowerment Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| This was our first in-person Neighborhoods Conference since 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| It was a huge success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| So during the harder times of the pandemic, we were able to pivot and do hybrid or virtual events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=191)|
| 0:03:20| and those worked out pretty well, but I think everyone was glad to be back in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| So really applaud our team for their perseverance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| Now I wanted to just make a final reminder to everyone about grant application deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| There are just two days left to apply for one of the City's Summer Opportunity Youth Programming Grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=213)|
| 0:03:38| These are designed for local organizations who are working to interrupt violence in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=218)|
| 0:03:43| You can find the application and a detailed video explaining what is needed to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| on our website at KnoxvilleTN.gov, Community Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| The deadline is 4.30 p.m. April 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| And now it is time to have an update from our Police Advisory Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| As you all know, PARCC plays an integral role in our city's public safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| working to strengthen the relationships between KPD and residents through an independent review of police actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| Serving in this capacity is difficult work, and that does not go unnoticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| So thank you to all the volunteer members of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| I think some of you are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Oh, there's Ms. Davidson and the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| Tonight, PARCC's Executive Director, Tiffany Davidson, is here, along with PARCC Chair, Janai Easterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| to share their annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| So thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| And now you can take about five minutes to share the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| And Councilmembers, you all have a hard copy in front of you, and it's already posted online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Okay. Thank you, Ms. Davidson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Thank you, Mayor and City Councilmembers, for your time this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| As you all may recall, 2021 was very short for me in regards to serving in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| However, in that short time, I was able to witness the level of commitment and dedication for members of our committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| and the commitment that they have for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Understanding their role and how important it is for members of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| the committee continues to serve as a driving force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| Here with me, I have Committee Chair, Janai Easterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| who will provide a quick snapshot of the work that PARCC was able to complete in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Thank you guys for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| In accordance with the City of Knoxville Ordinance No. 019401, Adapting PARCC, this report was prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| In 2021, PARCC closed a total of 33 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| One case was left pending, which was received later that year in the fourth quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| Of those closed cases, all 33 were resolved by our Executive Director and our KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=338)|
| 0:05:44| Similar to the year of 2020, 2021 presented some significant challenges and changes to the PARCC Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=344)|
| 0:05:51| In August of 2021, we were notified that our Executive Director at the time, Ms. LaKenya Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| had taken on a new role and that we would be under new leadership, Ms. Tiffany Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| Additionally, there were two new members appointed, Ms. Starlandria Starks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| She is a Program Director with Girl Talk Incorporated, a nonprofit here locally that mentors young girls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| as well as Attorney Heidi Barkas, who participates in civil litigation here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=373)|
| 0:06:19| Also, continuing to navigate through a pandemic presented its challenges, but we made it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=379)|
| 0:06:26| Obviously, the year 2021 was very difficult when evaluating police interactions with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Occurrences of violence and conflict that were made mainstream in national news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| kind of sparked some lack of transparency issues between the community and KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| It is our hope that the year 2020 will bring new ideas, transparency, and new policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| to help officers more accountable and to instill more trust in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=408)|
| 0:06:57| Thank you, Ms. Easterly. Thank you, Ms. Davidson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=417)|
| 0:07:01| Council members, if you have any questions, if there's a really quick question, we can take it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| But otherwise, Ms. Davidson is available to take your calls or emails as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| And you do have the document before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Ms. Easterly, do you have anything else you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| No, we are just really looking forward to, well, specifically me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| helping provide leadership and guidance to the committee as they continue to advance the work of PARCC within our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| Okay, and I understand that many members of PARCC just were able to complete the Citizens Police Academy, and Ms. Singh did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=450)|
| 0:07:40| Could you share a little bit about that experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Maybe Ms. Easterly or Ms. Davidson, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| Yes, so there were four committee members, as well as myself and the investigative manager, Marcus Rudolph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| that completed 10 weeks of Citizens Police Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| And we think that it's pertinent for us to have insight into the processes that KPD operates under in regards to how we conduct our work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=478)|
| 0:08:07| and ultimately have a better understanding and essentially find ways to be creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| and push things forward with consideration of general orders and standard operating procedures and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| So it was quite insightful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| I mean, that's a lot of work that the volunteer members of this committee put in, and that was above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| And we weren't able to do a Citizens Police Academy in 2020 or 2021 due to COVID, so it's good that it's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| Ms. Parker, did you have a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| I just wanted to go on record stating that it is difficult to ask questions when we're just receiving the report here at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=524)|
| 0:08:55| And if it could be listed under the mayor's report, then both the city council and the public will be able to review the report before it's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=535)|
| 0:09:05| I also just wanted to say thank you for the work that you do, and I appreciate the conversations that we've been able to engage in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| I do think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| I tried to glance through the report really quickly, but I didn't notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| But I do think it's important to acknowledge legislative changes on the state level that have impacted park work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=560)|
| 0:09:30| And I'm hoping to bring an ordinance before city council very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Hopefully we can hold a workshop and have more discussion about it to see how we can update our ordinances to ensure park is able to carry out its work to the fullest and best of its ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=575)|
| 0:09:48| And with the state legislation, I'm talking about changes to park subpoena power now having to come through city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| So hopefully we'll have more discussion on this very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=595)|

| 0:11:25| I'd like to take the opportunity to say a few words about our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| I've come to find that they are a humble bunch, but I'm going to shine a little bit of a spotlight on them for the things that so many of us don't even realize they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=689)|
| 0:11:41| Specifically, I want to talk about the Wares Valley Fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| And the Knoxville Fire Department played a very significant role in sending manpower, equipment, and planning and strategy to help curtail something that was bad enough but could have been much, much worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=704)|
| 0:12:01| And I have some friends and loved ones down in Wares Valley and they would like to extend their appreciation for helping them out as mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=721)|
| 0:12:11| And if it hadn't been for the efforts of the fire department, they may have lost their house and maybe their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| We just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| But anyway, I'd like to thank Chief Sharp and Chief Compton and all the members of the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| I truly hope that you all get more sleep than you have in the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220405?start=747)|
