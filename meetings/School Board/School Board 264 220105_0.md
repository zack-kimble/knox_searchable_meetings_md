| 0:01:03| observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=63)|

| 0:01:35| We have any elected officials in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=95)|
| 0:02:01| On behalf of the entire board I want to take a moment to welcome our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| staff, and students back in school and our hope and prayer is that everyone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| a wonderful and safe spring semester and although it was public notice that Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| Satterfield will be attending electronically tonight she will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=137)|
| 0:02:21| absent due to illness. And board members just a reminder and apparently people at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=141)|
| 0:02:28| home had a hard time hearing us last week so to speak in your microphone when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| we speak tonight. And changes to the agenda. Everyone received an email today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| but I wanted to note publicly that the attachments on item 6c2 and 10b have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| been updated. On 6c2 the letter of support for KCDC's project has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| placed on board letterhead along with signature lines for the Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| Thomas and myself. And for item 10b Superintendent Thomas and his team worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| with Ms. Owen. Thank you all for that. I know that was a quick turnaround with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| new schedule. And to update a document for the legislative priorities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| considerations everybody should have received those. And also and before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=191)|
| 0:03:16| Christmas we the board received an email from one of our Green Magnet parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| Nikki Petty and she had indicated she would be coming to a board meeting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=202)|
| 0:03:27| share some of the great things happening there. And if the board is agreeable I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| would like to move her to the front of the agenda tonight too because she is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| here as well. Are there any other changes to the agenda? Do we have? So a move by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=217)|
| 0:03:47| Warren, a second by Mr. Watson. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. And I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| turn it over to Superintendent Thomas. Thank you Madam Chair, members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| board. First announcement I'm sure most people have heard at this point that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| school will be closed tomorrow. So due to the inclement weather that's forecasted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=243)|
| 0:04:08| and the timing of the event that's supposed to happen early afternoon and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| around dismissal would create really dangerous situation, hazardous situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| for us trying to get students home and for students trying to get home and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| things of that nature. So we'll be out of school tomorrow. We'll see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=262)|
| 0:04:26| happens. Appreciate parents understanding and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| supporting us with that. You know safety is of the utmost importance and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| it's a huge inconvenience for parents and families but keep in mind we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| trying to make sure that we, our students are safe and our staff is safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| trying to get to school and getting home. So thank you. And this evening I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| appreciate chance to recognize one of our outstanding educators. Melody Hawkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=288)|

| 0:04:57| year she was an eighth grade science teacher at Bond Middle Magnet School. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=297)|

| 0:05:52| of what they can achieve. So please join me in recognizing Ms. Melody Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| And Melody if you'll come forth we'll give you a certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=359)|
| 0:06:09| Unfortunately we don't have a check for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=369)|
| 0:06:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=418)|
| 0:07:29| And Madam Chair one other introduction. See Dr. Dexter Murphy in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=449)|
| 0:07:37| audience. Dexter has been appointed as our director of ESSER program so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| Dexter if you could just stand up and just sort of say hi. Dexter's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=463)|
| 0:07:50| with us before and we're just so so so so glad to have him back and so he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| going to do a great job. It's a big responsibility and spending all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| ESSER funds but we know you'll keep us where we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| with the reporting on that. So thanks and congratulations Dexter. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Madam Chair. And Ms. Petty would you like to come up and share all the great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| things happening at Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| Hi my name is Nikki Petty and I'm a parent at Green Magnet. I have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| children, a second grader, fourth grader and fifth grader. About four years ago I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| was one of the founding members of Restarting the PTA and this year I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| serving as president. And when we first started this year we decided to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| focus on getting out all the good news of what's going on at Green both within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| our school community and within our broader community. So before Christmas we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| sent out an email and I also have paper copies here if no one forgot lost in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| your inbox I understand. So if you need another paper copy I don't know where to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| leave it here or hand it to someone. But I'll just highlight a few things that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| have written down. I think you've already heard that this year we're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| getting a brand new $650,000 outdoor learning space from the Boyd Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| That's really exciting because all of our children are really really excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| about getting to play on the new playground. And then based on our 2020 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| 2021 state TCAP data, GMA is in a composite level 5 school and growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| which is the highest rating achievable. Our community partner Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Community Development Corporation worked with our students to design a playground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| creation for the new park at the new Austin Homes project currently being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| built by KCDC. So representatives from KCDC visited GMA and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| evaluated each student. It was one individual project, one group project in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| each grade level and then they chose a winning design which will then be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| incorporated in the park. If you can imagine the new Austin Homes is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| right across the street from our school. A lot of children will I assume will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| probably live there so that's really exciting. In October, it was announced that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| we have established a new partnership with North Shore Elementary School. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| has been really amazing so far. In November they donated 300 coats and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| also came to one of our board meetings to help us get started. Like I said we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| only four years into it and it feels like we're starting over again after COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| from last year. And so they have been a really big help to not only our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| but also to our PTA board. Then in the spring 2022 semester we are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| again participating in the One School One Book campaign where we'll all be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| reading the Wild Robot Escapes and we're currently applying for the STEM| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| designation from the Tennessee STEM Innovation Network to become an official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| STEM designated school. So hopefully we will get to come back and celebrate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| later. Thank you all for all that you do and I'm gonna go home and prepare for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=659)|
| 0:11:04| tomorrow and thank you so much for moving me up in the agenda. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| And thank you for coming tonight. Thank you for having me. I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| say when we'd originally gotten this and you thought you were coming in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| you invited us to the fling and Miss Satterfield is not here who represents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| it and I know she was there and since she's not here to speak I went and guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| okay y'all have got to go to this. I think y'all do want to get in the spring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=686)|

| 0:11:45| when you went in the school and you saw all the things that were going on it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| really very inspiring and I just want to thank you. If you had not invited me I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| would not have gone and I really got so much out of the evening and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| appreciated that invitation. Oh well thank you so much and I meant to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| thank you for coming and thank you to Representative Satterfield too and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| extend another invitation and feel free to bring your kids, grandkids, nieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| nephews. It's really it's a fun night so free, free fun entertainment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=728)|

| 0:26:10| 9C approved contract with Dollar and Ewers Architecture Incorporated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| renovations to Lincoln Park Center at a cost of four hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| using ESSER 3.0 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| So a motion by Miss Owen, a second by Miss Horne and Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| Yeah I just I have a question just about what all Lincoln Park is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| used for after these renovations. I mean I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| we've right now we've got what Paul Kelly over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| and the Welcome Center. Are there is there anything else or those the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| main things over at Lincoln Center, Lincoln Park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1602)|
| 0:26:46| Thank you Madam Chair. Thank you Miss Babb. So part of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| with the ESSER dollars for us to and Russ could talk probably more about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| renovation but there's a portion of that building that can't be occupied by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| students at this time. So what we wrote into the ESSER plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| help our ELL population was a Newcomer Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| So the Welcome Center will be a place where that has been functioning for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| last couple years where it's a lot easier to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| to onboard students who come. The Newcomer Center would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| families to choose to keep their student in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| for it can be 12 to 18 months. We haven't totally landed on that yet where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| could get additional ELL services as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| academic supports while they're there or they could choose to go to the Bay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| School. So we've seen and have visited I know Miss Jackson and Mr. Myers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| and you know Slicher have visited various places where that happens and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| really seems to give a boost to students who are new to our system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| and needing those extra supports. So that too will be part of that but as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| the renovation part Mr. Oaks can probably speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| This is a renovation that we've had in the capital plan for a couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| but it has been for out years and what we'll be doing is if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| are familiar with Lincoln Park Center there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| two or three story addition from a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| We're going to upgrade that to make it usable and accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| for students which will include among other things putting in an elevator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| and then we've got to do window replacements and HVAC upgrades and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| electrical upgrades. So some of this you'll see and some of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| you want but it it will be all to make the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| more usable for Kelly Academy the Welcome Center and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| Newcomer Center. I know when I went several of us went and visited over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| there Paul Kelly recently and we got to tour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| the whole building and we were there there were a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| adult kind of I guess trade classes going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| Will those continue to keep going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| I'm not aware of what we currently have going on with adult trades over there. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| it is it's of an evening that's being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| and I thought most of that had been moved to Fulton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| So we have a motion by Ms. Owen and a second by Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| Any more discussion? All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1750)|

| 0:29:37| So a motion by Ms. Horne. Do we have a second? Second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Ms. Henderson and Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| Does this contract with Pew cover all of the auditing services? I know we had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| audit delivered the other day but that's only one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| a couple audits correct? Yes sir that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Mr. Watson it actually just covers student activity funds those are funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| that reside at the school so it does not cover district funds. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1804)|

| 0:30:29| All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1829)|

| 0:30:42| Any discussion? Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| Just a couple of questions. I noticed that there were a couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| things in this update that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| were missing from what we talked about on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| Monday night. One being there's no mention made of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1860)|
| 0:31:08| special schools or money used for vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| that sort of stuff in what I see unless I miss something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1875)|
| 0:31:21| Sit on the back? Okay okay I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I beg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| beg your forgiveness. Everything else was just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| one sided that I looked at. The other thing I wanted to ask about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| what about the we talked about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| the grade on the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| a little bit the other night. I mean it was in it was it was on the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| Were you moving forward with it or or not or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1915)|
| 0:32:03| before we give a letter grade you know what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| I think that was in the 2021 version. Well it was in something that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| approved I mean we talked about in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| you know. I just wondered what what your thoughts were as to why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1936)|
| 0:32:24| why it wasn't at least mentioned or brought up. I guess I should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| mentioned it Monday night more. I think we have space to add it back on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| if you'd like. Pardon me? I believe there's space to add it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| back on if you would like to add it. Well now well you may or may not want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| add it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| I would like to see it added back on but I also believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| they should be allowed if they wish to give a grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| Now I know about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| students with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| with the problems and but I don't think there are any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| schools that would fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| with more than 20 percent and they could be if they if they do well we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| exclude those but I guess where I'm coming from is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| don't want to embarrass anybody or or you know pick on anybody at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| but I do think that the people the parents who send their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2018)|
| 0:33:45| kids to these schools have a right to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| what kind of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2030)|
| 0:33:54| grade the overall performance that the school is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| That's the that's where I'm coming from. Right and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| what the what the school grading section said before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| I think it's I think it says what you're what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| it said that the Knox County Board of Education opposes legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| requiring the A through F grading of public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| We would like to see an accountability system that does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| stigmatize students schools and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| So I think we're saying we would like to see a system that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| makes that clearer is when when all you stick on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| the discussion with TSBA in the past has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| when you just stick that letter grade on there that doesn't tell you much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| and so some kind of accountability system that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| give more information to parents besides just that letter grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| would be maybe more appropriate. But up to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| they haven't chosen to do that and I think the legislature is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| is that in effect now or does it go into effect next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| I believe they passed A through F grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| It has passed it just hasn't gone into effect yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| I'm not sure when the date is. I think it's next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| Okay. This are you talking about 23-24?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2117)|
| 0:35:27| Okay. Okay. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| I mean we could still ask for some of this still ask for revision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| It doesn't if it's already been passed it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| I just you know my only thing was like you said there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| I don't want to stigmatize anybody but at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| the if the vast majority of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| fall in a 80 percent or or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| category where their whatever normal students are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| general student population whatever term you want to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| I think the community and parents do deserve to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| accountability that that they understand. I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| you can use a letter grade you can use a percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| you know whatever a number whatever one to five whatever just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| accountability for those is all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| Whatever y'all want to do whatever the pleasure of the board is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| Is the staff good with adding that back as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| Does anybody object to adding that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| Is there any more discussion on that? Does anybody have strong feelings about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| adding that back? Do you want us to add that back in Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| Okay. I think it might you know encourage them to to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2230)|
| 0:37:17| So shall I add that to my motion? Right and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| I guess maybe use the same language or Ms. Horne didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| Well I just want to make sure I'm clear. So right now the state legislature has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| said my understanding is correct. That they will be grading A through B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| That they will be that the grades will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| by school so that beginning the next school year I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| that we will it will be on the state website so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| By letter? Okay. So is that what you want it to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| I want some accountability. They've already approved that so if we add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| anything it would be I guess. It would be to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| Right to amend that. So just leave it like it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Based on what you've said I don't think we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| No we don't need it. I thought thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| informing me of that. I knew they had discussed it but I wasn't aware that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| they actually adopted it and voted to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| give letter grades. Okay. Thank you. Mr. Watson. Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| I just wanted to say thank you to Ms. Owen and to the team from the staff that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| worked on this. I think this is very reflective of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| conversation that we had last week. I think it helps a lot. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| think it was Ms. Horn's idea or somebody's to put the current BEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| numbers that we actually fund. I think that's really helpful and then also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| footnotes on the second page. So I think it's clear easy to read and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| it's very summative of what we discussed so thank you for the work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| was put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| Ms. Owen. Thank you Madam Chair. I'd also note that we're looking at a black and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| white version but Ms. Harrington did a very nice job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| with color on this and it has the branding at the bottom on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| both sides. It has the seal for to make it official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| and all of the large subtitles are all blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| and matches our branding very nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| Okay and that is attached to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2358)|
| 0:39:22| Mr. McMillan did you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Nothing other than I may vote against it because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| the I mean if we're going to vote on it collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| because of the school vouchers and the only reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2376)|
| 0:39:44| is because of the wording there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2384)|
| 0:39:52| I know most people most public school teachers everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2392)|
| 0:39:59| oppose those but I think the time has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| not necessarily for vouchers per se even though they've been being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| but we are we as a school system are going to have to do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2411)|
| 0:40:18| of educating these kids if we don't want the vouchers to create pain in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| opinion and you know I think they have every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| right to make that effort if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| if they wish so that's that's all I don't I don't ask for you to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| the wording on anything or anything. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Ms. Horne. Thank you Madam Chair. You know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| in thinking about it would be nice if we could vote on this collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| instead of going through it by issue I don't think that's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| good way to do it so Mr. McMillan if you if that's something that if we took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| vouchers out of it you know if if perhaps the board would be agreeable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| because we had two versions the other day one that did have it one that didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| I don't think that it's a topic right now because I believe that there's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| litigation so not sure we have to have it on there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| so if if we could get a unanimous vote on this if we took it out that's what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| would prefer to see happen so if we can have some discussion on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| so I'd like to hear from other people. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| Mr. Watson. Sorry. Thank you Madam Chair. So when I was at TSBA at the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| workshop that happened the the thing that got the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| commentary from across all the different districts that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| representative was the concern that the the funding formula as they're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| remake it is going to be designed to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| encourage and push vouchers in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| and I think if there's if you're against vouchers in that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| I think if there's any time to put it on there it's right now why they're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| at redoing the funding formula because I think it sends the message that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| yes we want a new funding formula but we don't want it to become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| an opportunity to increase or to advance the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| the voucher issue so to me by removing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| it's if you are again if you're against vouchers and not everybody in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| is I understand that if you are if you remove it then what it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| basically I think is saying based upon the concerns that we've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| is that yes we're good with a funding formula change and yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| if it makes it easier for vouchers then go for it since it has been a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| our legislative priorities for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| so like like I would ask myself if I was a legislator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| why did they remove it this year so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| Miss Henderson. Thank you Madam Chair I just want to say that I agree with Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| McMillan if the school vouchers portion is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| there I'm going to have to vote no but if it is taken off I do agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| everything else that's on this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| Mr McMillan. I was just going to respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| Mr Watson's comment about the way that you get rid of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| or that you repel the voucher creeping in is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2599)|
| 0:43:26| you do a better job and if we year after year after year that's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2606)|
| 0:43:32| money problem because we've thrown money at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| but if we cannot do that then I think it makes you know it makes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| it real difficult to present that same old argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| it's kind of kind of like you know the when you when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| use the the same argument expect different results in in my opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2636)|
| 0:44:04| but and and I think that's what you know that would be the way you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2644)|
| 0:44:13| there's some people that you're never or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| some students you're never going to get there with simply because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| but you can make strides but their their limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| are there and you know but I think it's coming and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2664)|
| 0:44:31| whether it's being talked about this year you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| I think it's it's going to there might be so many other things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| they don't really get to it this year but and I realize there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| out-of-state money coming in here for work and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I don't really like that but I do like people having a choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| if I send a kid to school and maybe the kid's not the smartest kid in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| the world but he's just average but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| but if he can't perform over there like he should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| then maybe I I should look at sending him to a private school someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2709)|
| 0:45:15| thank you miss Ellen thank you madam chair um I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| suggest a potential compromise if we could take out the last two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| sentences under school vouchers um I wonder if this would work for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2727)|
| 0:45:33| who are opposed to leaving this in so that I would remind us that several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| years ago this used to say opposition to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| vouchers and we changed that language to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| less negative so if we only left the sentence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| says the knox county board of education supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| school choice within the public district and lea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| and opposes any legislation that diverts public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| public tax dollars to private schools would that be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| an acceptable compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| mr and and I don't want to I don't want to speak for the people on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| the other side of the room to me changing language does not satisfy what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| they're talking about so what I was going to suggest was just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| way for us to vote on this I mean at one point we had talked about doing item by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| item to me everybody's verbally it seems pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| much in agreement on most of it that if we could vote on everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| except the school vouchers to go forward and then vote on the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| voucher separately and that would just be a proposal instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| of us having to go through every single one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| but then I don't want to speak to miss owens there might be some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| what people think about her suggestion mr mcmillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| thank you madam chair miss owen would you uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| accept ending the sentence where it says lea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| knox county board of education supports school choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| within the public district le and slash lea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2830)|
| 0:47:17| I think that that misses our point of not not taking away those public tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| dollars well they're going to take them away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| whether you want them to or not you know you we can sit here and gripe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| about it but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| that putting that in there changes the the whole meaning about it have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| talked to all of our local legislators about that what what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| I would add to that is that school choice within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| the district is already a law that we have to allow transfers within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| district so okay that's already that's a law so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| wouldn't actually then there's no point in the whole thing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| there really isn't any point in sending it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| send everything else leave the school vouchers out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| because I assure you that they are going to do what they want to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| over there they're not going to be influenced by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| whatever knox county said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| I can't I can't prove it to you I mean in in absolute form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| but I feel very strong about it thank you Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2911)|
| 0:48:39| thank you madam chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| I agree that our ability to sway the legislation is probably limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| um I think that the point of legislative priorities though is to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| regardless of what you end up doing this is what we feel as a district is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| important I know there was a lot of people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| push against partisan school board elections but it got passed anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| I don't think that meant that none of those people should have pushed against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| it I think if you fundamentally believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| that we shouldn't be diverting public dollars to private schools then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| you should make that known as a district regardless of whether or not they heed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| your your call or listen to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| so anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| and I agree with this one I think it's a stronger document if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| we all agree on everything in the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| I'll just go on record saying that and and you know I would also note I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2978)|
| 0:49:45| that a lot of our state representatives have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| even had this as a campaign platform many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| them so you know if if they're running on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| or mentioning this in their platforms I don't know that listing it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| change a lot of opinions that Mr. Macmillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| thank you madam chair I agree with what you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| madam chair I think probably if anything if it has any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| impact it sort of irritates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| but what I wanted to ask and I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3022)|
| 0:50:26| I'm not sure exactly who I should ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| Dr. Eisen do you often and if you're the wrong person why you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| direct me to who could answer just generally speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| didn't I read somewhere where we lost like between three and four thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| kids last year out of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| well Mr. Oaks answered that question he's more accurate I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| off the top of my head as I recall our enrollment was down about fifteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| hundred yeah that's how have we lost as many as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| as over say a three year period since you've you you've been here a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| long time you you mean the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| last if I'm if I'm remembering correctly last year was the first year we saw a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| significant decline that was and we and and and we attributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| uh that largely to COVID and actions that parents took and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| in respect to you know you know homeschooling homeschooling or sending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| them to private school uh that and and uh much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| interest in in virtual schools and and people withdrawing uh for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| reasons there's also a similar dynamic that's that's at in effect that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| our uh folks at Knox planning tell me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| we will see over time and that's a general uh dip in enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| due to decline in birth rates that began around 2008-2009 with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| the economic downturn and we'll begin to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| see more of that but uh you know we got our uh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| enrollment projections uh or growth projections from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| uh Knox planning a couple of weeks ago and we're working through those right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| now to turn those into enrollment projections and you know we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| should have those in a few weeks and can talk a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| more about them but but well I'm sure you're correct I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| remember where I read but it was I read something within the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| oh six or eight weeks where uh maybe it was projected that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| would be down 3,000 or something maybe it was just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| projected thing. Anyway, thank you. Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3168)|
| 0:53:19| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you, Madam Chair. I just looked at the vote for this last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| um and it was 7-2 um for our legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| um and I know when we made the point several times that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| if we can get a unanimous list of priorities then it makes it stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| correct? I think if we vote on it whole right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| whether or not we remove it or keep it we're not going to get 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| That's my opinion. I don't know that. We haven't had the vote yet. I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| speak a little bit more to Ms. Babb's proposal is that we take that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| piece out vote on that one separately. If it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| if it gets if it gets approval then we keep it in and then we vote on the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| thing. If it doesn't then we leave it out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| you'll get a hundred percent vote on the rest of the legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I would guess reading the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| I just want to say I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| If you get a unanimous approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| if you want to take it out, let's just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| 1-5-4. I think we probably could do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Let's say it's 1-5-4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| you know then that makes it look even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| We agree on everything else except this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3280)|
| 0:54:43| That draws more attention to it in my opinion but you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3283)|
| 0:54:53| I know a little bit about politics I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| I'm not bragging or anything but I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| to tell you that to draw attention to it with less than a unanimous vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| or an 8-1 vote does not do any good. Now as far as principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3306)|
| 0:55:14| I would agree with you Mr. Watson. You should stand on your principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| and many times before you came along when this board when nobody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3318)|
| 0:55:26| except the superintendent was sitting around the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| I was the one vote on many I. So I have no problem being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| one vote but I'm standing on principle. That's all I'm going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| Ms. Henderson. I make a motion we take the school voucher section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| out of the legislative priorities and vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| the document like it was last week. Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3351)|
| 0:55:58| Are you trying to make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Because there's a motion on the floor. A substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| A substitute motion. I apologize. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| Okay so there is a substitute motion to remove the section on school vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| in a second by Ms. Horne and discussion on that Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| Thank you Madam Chair. I'd like to remind everyone that whether we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| unanimous vote or not a vote of the board is a vote of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| board. So when this document goes to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| legislature it doesn't go and say that it was an 8-2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| or I mean 8-1 or 9-0 or 7-2. It doesn't say that. It says this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| is the vote of the board. So whether we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| whether we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| a partial disagreement with all of it or with some of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| any of us carrying this document should not be saying that. What we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| be saying is this is what our board voted on. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| if there is if there's a piece in here that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| particularly supportive of or particularly against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| when I carry this to the legislature I don't I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| tell them that. I have to say these are the priorities of the board of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| I know if we are if we're looking at it in how many voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| for or against it and if our legislators ask us that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| our answer I believe is that it was the vote of the board. I mean if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| they want to go back and look at the minutes and figure it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| of course they could but as far as representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| a vote of the board it that's just what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| Thank you. Mr. McMillan. Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Well Ms. Owen why were you promoting the the unanimous thing if it didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| make any difference? You have promoted unanimous in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| Yes you have. Today what I asked was if this would be a compromise whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| it's unanimous or not that's that's up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| however we vote. I was just looking for a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| While I have the floor and I might be out of order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| law director you rule me out if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| Can we vote on the main motion before we vote on substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3519)|
| 0:58:44| No. No. Substitute first. Okay that's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| I just thought I'd see what you say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3528)|
| 0:58:57| So we have a motion or substitute motion to remove the section on school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3537)|
| 0:59:03| vouchers and leave everything else as is. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| correct? By Ms. Henderson and a second by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| Horne and we will be voting on that first. Is that correct? And then if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3550)|
| 0:59:17| should fail does it go back to the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Okay so just Ms. Babb. I just want clarification on what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| So are we voting is the vote just to take it out and then if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3564)|
| 0:59:30| that gets approved then we still have to vote that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| this is our legislative stuff or is it one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| I just want to make sure. Ms. Henderson can correct me if I'm wrong but I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| for substitute motion is vote on the on the priorities without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| the vouchers. Is that correct? So to my understanding we are voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| the one piece of taking out the school voucher section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| So for example I would vote yes because I want that part taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| If that passes we would then vote on the legislative priorities without that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| section. If that substitute motion fails we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| then vote on the priorities as this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| It is a two vote. So you vote for the substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| and then the original motion correct? So okay well yeah yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| I'm glad we're discussing this trying to get this trying to get this correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| because because a substitute motion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| that you're simply taking out school vouchers and voting for the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| document. That's a substitute motion okay. An amended an amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| original motion which is what it sounds like you're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| would be asking to just simply remove school vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| So so were you so you you were wanting a substitute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| motion which would be so basically if this if your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| substitute motion passed we would be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| You'd be done that's correct. I mean so the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3656)|
| 1:01:00| would be voting on this as if school vouchers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| was exempt from this document. Correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| Yes. Are we clear? Is everyone clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| Okay so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| yeah so we'll do a roll call vote on that. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3677)|
| 1:01:20| not any more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| Ms. Owen. No. Mr. Watson. No. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3684)|
| 1:01:31| Ms. Horn. Yes. Ms. Henderson. Yes. Ms. Bounds. Yes. Mr. McMillan. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3691)|
| 1:01:39| Ms. Christie. Yes. That's four yes votes to no votes. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| Babb and Ms. Bounds would you like to change your pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| So that's five yes votes, two no votes, and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3711)|
| 1:02:00| So motion carries. So we will move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| Item 10c approve retainer agreement with Millsaps-Gowman government relations for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| provision of governmental consulting services to the coalition of large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| school systems. Class for the term January 1 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| December 31, 2022 at a cost of $37,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| using general purpose funds. So moved. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| So motion by Ms. Babb, a second by Ms. Owen. Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| Ms. Owen. Thank you Madam Chair. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3753)|
| 1:02:37| I've reached out to a few people today to get some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| so that we could more accurately talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3760)|
| 1:02:44| what they have done for us over the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| Everyone should have in their email a link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| from this that Ms. Coatney has sent out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| all of the documentation that I have. It doesn't go back very far though because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| I haven't been the class representative for very long. So I will reach out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| try to add to that as I can. One thing that they worked with us on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| was a biz ed bill a couple years ago and I recall that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| was something that Knox County had specifically reached out to them about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3795)|
| 1:03:19| because it was going to impact us by causing us to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| hire several more biz ed teachers. And Dr. Roswick, do you remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| approximately how many more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| My thinking was 17 or something. I was going to say it was in the teens. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| could remove the exact number. So you know 17 additional positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| that we would have had to hire because of that legislation and so they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| were able to discuss that with our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| and explain it in a way that they understood that that was going to impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| us very significantly. I did talk to a couple of legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| today and I have reached out to some others I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| haven't heard back from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| One thing I have, I just have some quotes here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| if we need to know anything they always have the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| One said they are perfect and always on top of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| They are the main public school voice which I was very surprised to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| What this legislator told me is that they see TEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3862)|
| 1:04:29| they see TSBA, they see public school advocates, but they consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3869)|
| 1:04:37| see Mills-Sapson-Gallon there. So that was something very interesting that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| had not expected at all. She said the others are kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| hit or miss. If there's a big issue they are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| but Mills-Sapson-Gallon are always there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| legislators can always reach out to them with questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| or to find out where we are on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| I was also told that there have been around 60 lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| pushing for various charter organizations and private entities at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3905)|
| 1:05:09| any one time and public schools just have three or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3909)|
| 1:05:13| four groups that have lobbyists. So having a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| swath of that taken out would be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| There was also a bill that I had forgotten about that I was reminded of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| It was a bill to make it illegal for public schools to hire lobbyists or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3927)|
| 1:05:32| lobbying firms. And what I was told is that that was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3932)|
| 1:05:37| direct result of how good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| our lobbyists have been. That our lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| are doing such a good job of representing our needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3946)|
| 1:05:53| that those privatizers pushed for legislation to get rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| them. So that bill obviously didn't pass, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| that's something to be aware of too. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| those folks that we have in Nashville who are lobbying on our behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| are doing the kind of job that's causing other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| to want them gone. So that's definitely something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| And while we're on that point of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| there are some folks in some other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3986)|
| 1:06:29| who are in our positions who may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| ties to organizations that are privatization organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| So when we're talking to individuals in other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| we might want to look into that and see whether there is another interest there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| that that may be impacting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| Okay, so any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| Thank you, Madam Chair. After Monday's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| I was provided a copy of the bylaws and so I wanted to give the board some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| information from a legal perspective. You know, based upon the way the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| are written, our office is for class, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| Our office would not recommend going ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| declining or, you know, not paying the bill at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4051)|
| 1:07:35| What the bylaws state is that if you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| resign from the class, so to speak, it has to be done by the first day of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| November of the fiscal year. So, you know, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| this board can do what it wants, obviously, but I mean there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| consequences for that. You may end up paying a bill and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| not having the same representation. I believe why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| it's set up like that. I wasn't around when this thing was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| but I believe why that is is because, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| January, February, when the legislature meets. So, I mean, that way class could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| you know, organized and no saps going forward before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| this time period we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Another thing I wanted to say was that I thought Ms. Horne had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| excellent suggestion Monday night about meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| These bylaws contemplate meeting as a membership twice a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| That may be unrealistic, but in light of the November 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| deadline, if you're meeting through TSBA, you may want to consider it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| during the summer session, you know, in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| That may be another idea, and then there's also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| you know, talks about designated representatives, and obviously Ms. Owen's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| been the designated representative for this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| but it's also the director of schools or superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| So, the designated representatives of each board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| could also meet, you know, sometime soon to discuss this. So, I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4143)|
| 1:09:08| throw out those facts that were gleaned from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| the bylaws. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| So, Ms. Horne, do you think it would be possible with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| the session that's coming up in February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| Even, you know, if we're, if we've already committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| for next year, which is kind of sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| we have. Yeah. But I do, I do think we need to have this discussion because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4173)|
| 1:09:40| you know, I know Ms. Henderson had some concerns about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| you know, when they came here last, and I will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| that I was a little frustrated at the meeting we had with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| at TSBA, and I don't think you were there, but I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| sooner we could start this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| the more productive we would be. Yeah, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| the Board of Directors meets on prior to the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| session in the morning of the 15th, I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| So, probably in the afternoon of the 16th, we might be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| You know, there may be time. Ms. Coatney, do you remember if I'm remembering that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| schedule correctly? I think it maybe ends midday on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| I believe it ends by 12 noon on the 15th. On the 15th. So, it's the 14th and 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| Okay. So, maybe on the 15th, maybe on that Tuesday, I think it is, we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| possibly, and so, yeah, I think we should absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| see if we can get that pulled together. Yeah, the annual TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| would be after November 1st, right? So, we'd have to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| and I'm not sure if we would get, Gary's other suggestion is what is the Summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| Institute, but I don't know if we get Shelby County. I don't know if they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| here for that. They may, but I think Nashville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| more, Nashville's much more, you know, convenient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| centrally located. So, yeah, I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| So, I think that would be, does everybody know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| who's going to that February meeting? Is everybody going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| Yeah, I mean, most of us will be there, so I think that's a great time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4270)|
| 1:11:14| And I think discussing whether Rutherford County needs to be a part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| it is a good time to talk about it. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| would be a good discussion for that group to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| Yeah, I mean, I don't know if, I guess it would be nice if they could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| they're not a part of class. Maybe that could be a conversation that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| the class representatives have, you know, to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| if they could be invited to that meeting. What do you think about that, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| I can reach out to them to do that. Our regular annual winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4299)|
| 1:11:46| meeting with class is during that TBSBA time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| usually. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| Do we meet with class that night? Every year we have an annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| meeting with class during TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4317)|
| 1:12:02| in the fall, and we have another winter meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| when we have the legislative workshop. Those dates have changed from when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| were before, so I'm not sure if that's still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| if that's still happening or not. Okay, so maybe we could, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| as our class representative, Ms. Owen could find out if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| they would be open to having, inviting Rutherford County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| and having further additional discussions that we don't typically have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| And were these discussions going to be without the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| lobbyist present as well, right? Right, so we probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| you know, we may need two, we may even need two different times. One, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| that's what you're saying, Jennifer, is that we have updates from Millsaps and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Gowan during that meeting. Right, and they are also very willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| facilitate bringing everyone together from all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| our districts for this kind of meeting. They welcome us discussing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| so I think they would be very willing to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4376)|
| 1:13:01| I'd also like to note that whatever, whatever kind of criteria we start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4381)|
| 1:13:07| talking about that we would like to judge them on, that's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| we should give them in advance, because if we're going to be saying we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| like this and we don't like that, I think they need to know that. Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| expectations, so if we want them to give us a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| different kind of presentation, that's something we need to tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| instead of saying we don't like this kind of presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| So somehow to discuss that I think would be useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| Okay, yeah, I would agree. Ms. Babb. Yeah, I would just say from what I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| experienced, our class meetings are really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| presentations by McGowan, yeah, in Millsaps, that I think that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| is two different things we're talking about. I think we want their legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| update, because I think that's always helpful before we go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| to talk to our legislators or do whatever we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| I think what I feel like we've talked about here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| we want to get together the board people and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| what do we want from a lobbyist. I mean, I don't know that we've really had that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| discussion, and they might be doing exactly what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| want to do with them. Once again, this is not to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| a critique of them. I think it's just, I know since I've been on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| we have never had that discussion in class unless, and see, I don't think y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| have, because you've got them on the phone with you. So that's where I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| don't think that discussion goes on. They are very willing to facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| putting this kind of meeting together that you're talking about without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| Yeah, and so that's where I think it's two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| I think it's two different things we want. I think we want to meet with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| lobbyists while we're there. I think that's very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| but then I think we also, and maybe it's just one after the other. I mean, maybe we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| have that or legislate with them. I think that would make it a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| If, you know, we just, they left. I mean, and I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| we're publicly done. They probably know we're talking about this. Once again, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| not necessarily a critique of them. It's just, I think anybody we're hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| we need to be reviewing, and we, but we never have that chance because we never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| really have those discussions. I feel like the only time we've really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| ever talked, what was the thing that a bunch of us went over to with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| special session, and a bunch of them went? I can't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| now, Lord. Oh, I know what you're talking about, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| But, you know, I think our regular winter meeting. No, there was something else that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| we all went rushing over there for, and we met with the governor, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| it was, it was through TSBA. It was in 2019 or 20, I don't know, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| anyway, a lot of Shelby County people were there, but so other than that, oh, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| met with the governor, yeah, yeah. I don't feel like a lot of us, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| feel like we've ever had that opportunity in my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| so I do think it's time to do that kind of reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| So, I agree. I think that two meetings back to back would be great, but have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4535)|
| 1:15:39| with Millsaps and Cowan so we could have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| regular update and then one without them, and also maybe coordinate that through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| the board chairs so that we could have specific topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| that are going to be discussion points, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| obviously we need an agenda, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| whether it's, you know, what are you doing about getting more substitutes or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| whatever the topic is that people want to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| because that's where I feel like we could just get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| dialogue going just about, you know, how your,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| what's going on in your district that we may be able to help each other or look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| for ideas or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4575)|
| 1:16:25| They actually tried to put together this kind of meeting recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| and sent the invitations to 80 of us, but only six responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| So, you know, is that from Shelby County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| No, I remember all of us. We got it from all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| All of the board, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| It was going to be, the meeting was going to be in Shelby County, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| who is chair of the organization at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| or at that time, but it has now moved to Nashville, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| might be. Yeah, I remember that invitation. I think there was no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| preface for it, and so it was very confusing as to who it was, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| is that the one that was? It was for a general meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| with all four of our boards, so that we could discuss whatever we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4629)|
| 1:17:14| and I believe it had been specifically requested by Hamilton County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| so that's sort of where that came from, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| I don't know if you, I think Jenny from Hamilton County is who was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| looking at that. But I do think that's, I remember getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| that, and I don't know if I respond. I'm good about responding, so I probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| responded whether I go or not, but I think that was when we got it, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4654)|
| 1:17:38| we'd never done it. It was sort of like, why are we doing this? Whereas I think if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| our four board chairs can meet and have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| discussion, and they're all then communicating out to us about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| I think there'll be much more sense of why we're doing this, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| like I said, I don't know that any of us realized or really understood what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| meeting was, so I think I like that idea. Ms. Christy, we're putting something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4676)|
| 1:18:01| That's okay. No, I do think that it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| better to have this discussion sooner, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| you know, to kind of clear it up, so maybe if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| do that in February. So is that going to be a board chair discussion, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| or do you want me to do it through the reps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4697)|
| 1:18:23| Or do both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| So, Mr. DeParditte? I mean, thank you, Madam Chair. I mean, according to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| according to the bylaws, it could be either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Either the chair or the designee, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| would, this board's designee would be Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| So Ms. Owen, if you want to arrange that, you know, since you are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| contact with them frequently and have those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| relationships. I can talk with them and let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| That sounds good. So, and Mr. DePorte, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4741)|
| 1:19:06| what I'm hearing you say before we vote on this is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| we are already pretty much committed for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. The way I read the bylaws, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| financially committed for this year. So, so you could still back out, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| we're gonna be paying, but still paying the bill. Yeah, so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| so if we're paying them, we probably want them to work for us. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| All right, so we have a motion by Ms. Babb and a second by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| Owen. Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| Do we need a roll call vote, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| Ms. Owen? Yes. Mr. Watson? Yes. Ms. Babb? Yes. Ms. Horn? Yes. Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4793)|
| 1:20:01| Ms. Bounds? Mr. McMillan? And Ms. Christie? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| Seven yes votes and one no vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| So, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4812)|
| 1:20:18| And item 10d, discussion and possible action on superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4818)|
| 1:20:26| So, Ms. Henderson? I know last week during our discussion, we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| voting on two items during that, so I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| make a motion for the board to accept the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| of the superintendent search committee to begin salary negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| with any potential candidate for superintendent at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| $250,000, not including employee benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| and to allow the superintendent search committee to continue their work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| TSBA on developing the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| evaluation framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4858)|
| 1:21:04| Okay, so we have a motion by Ms. Henderson, a second by Ms. Babb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| and Ms. Owen? I have a question for Mr. Dupler, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4868)|
| 1:21:16| Salary negotiations, does that normally happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| during the interview process or after the candidate is hired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4879)|
| 1:21:28| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Owen. So, salary negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4888)|
| 1:21:33| in the past has occurred once the board arrives at a candidate, a top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4893)|
| 1:21:39| candidate, but before the contract is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| So, I mean, so if you're saying hired, it would occur before hire, if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| answers your question. But it would, it would occur before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| hire, but after the work of the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| right? So, can the committee negotiate? My question is, can the committee negotiate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| Well, I think, I think the motion is that for the board to adopt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4924)|
| 1:22:10| the recommendation of the committee for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| starting salary, and then, and then the committee is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| develop the evaluation framework. So, that's, so I don't think the committee is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| going to do the negotiation. That's not the language that I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| So, maybe we need to rephrase the motion. Yeah, so our intent is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| begin that salary at $250,000 with negotiations, of course, would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| whole board, not the search committee making those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| negotiations. So, does with negotiation need to be part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| of that motion? My concern is that it sounds to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| like that motion is saying that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| committee will negotiate, and I understand that's not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| intent. So, I want to be sure that that's not the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4977)|
| 1:23:06| Mr. McMillan. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Henderson, I guess I would ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| this question, since you were, William and Ms. Bounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| both were on there. Is the $250,000, is that where you start at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=4996)|
| 1:23:24| Is that what you're saying, Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| I'm sorry, I'm working on the wording. Can you repeat? Is the committee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| recommendation that they start at $250,000 negotiating and go upward? Correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| but that the starting salary would be $250,000. That is our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| How did you all arrive at that? Well, during our search committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5025)|
| 1:23:50| we talked about a range, which we thought a range wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| a good idea, because if a range, let's say, was $250,000 to $300,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| people would focus on that higher number. So, we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| $250,000 and also looking at the other districts that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| are the same size as ours and taking their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| current superintendent salary, this was a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| number that was competitive to the districts that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| comparable in our size. What's the salary for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| Hamilton County? We had a, do you have that chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| Ms. Coatney? There was a chart with the five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| let me see if I can pull that up. Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Henderson, that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| attached to the agenda from the committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| which is available electronically. If you go back to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| meeting, it's attached. Of course, Davidson and Shelby are much larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| counties. Well, and we also talked about Williamson County. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| are, I think, the richest county in the state, and so we didn't really look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| their, take their salary. No, I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| concern is, you know, given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| I don't know what the mayor makes now, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| I think it's $100,000. So, the salary, the superintendent salary in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| Hamilton County is $225,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| In Hamilton County? Yes. Well, that would be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| in line, I would think, with, you know, we could always raise it later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| on, but to negotiate it, and I tend to agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| what you said about you focus on the higher number. Why would it not be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5129)|
| 1:25:37| you know, if you've got to have two numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| you could go maybe $225,000 to $250,000, or you could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5140)|
| 1:25:49| you know, we negotiate up to, you don't have to have a bottom number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| as far as that goes, you would possibly up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| to as much as two people, but I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| and I know there are people that think contrary to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| that they should be paid, you know, $300, maybe $350 or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| but when you look at salaries, particularly in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| I just don't think that's, that us jumping out there and paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| you know, a government salary, that's not in accordance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5183)|
| 1:26:30| what the mayor makes of Knox County. I don't know, I haven't checked lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5190)|
| 1:26:37| but I think the congressman that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| represents Knox County makes less than $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| I think. I think I'm correct on that. Do you know, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| Hooper? I don't, I don't know for sure, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| I would say, and I recall this from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| committee meeting, the $225,000 for Hamilton County was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5218)|
| 1:27:02| dated because they just hired a new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| New superintendent, check this online, now makes $240,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| in Hamilton County. But, well, as far as what I was referencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| there, the congressman, they used to make $177,000, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| you know, maybe they, that was just standard pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| but maybe they make more now. I'm not sure. I haven't seen salaries lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| Yeah, no, you're correct. Yeah, congressman makes around $178,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5250)|
| 1:27:34| Okay. But we were using comparable superintendent salaries to try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| come up with this, with a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| Does it not bother you a little bit to jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| way above all these others? Now, there are people in town that make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| a lot more than that, but they're in the private sector. Yeah, we thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| that with, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| here, Mr. McMillan, I'm going to share this chart with you that has the salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| superintendent for all the districts that are comparable in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| our size. Any candidate that we get that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| to apply for this job knows the range, knows the salary of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| superintendents of districts this size, and so we have to have a competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| rate. Well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| some of these, I think, could be kicked out. Davidson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| and Shelby County, because they're so much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| Rutherford County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| no, it's Williamson County that makes, that's the richest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| So, as you mentioned, they make a lot more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| Okay, yeah, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| Rutherford makes $160,000 and they have $47,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5345)|
| 1:29:13| People, 50 schools, about half the schools we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5353)|
| 1:29:20| Montgomery has even fewer than that. Okay, I see, but I see what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| talking about. And I understand what you're saying, too. But just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| based on a couple of schools there, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| I would like to see it, you know, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| I'll make a substitute motion that we negotiate from $230,000 to $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| Give him about a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| So, do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| It's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| Ms. Horn, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| But now, once somebody asks you, but what, why you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| you're paying the superintendent all this money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| you better be ready to explain it to them. I don't remember why. And they will ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5417)|
| 1:30:22| I don't recall why I had my light on, sadly, because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| I don't know, but anyway, I guess if Mr. Dupler said that Hamilton County, let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| make sure I understand this, Hamilton County just hired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| the superintendent and they, their salary is $240,000, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| Yes, and again, it's, I was just trying to, trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| pass along some accurate information, but TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| provided that list for the committee that Ms. Henderson's referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5445)|
| 1:30:50| and it listed $225,000, but they hired a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5450)|
| 1:30:56| superintendent recently, and that was publicly reported as $240,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5456)|
| 1:31:06| And they have about 45,000 students, so they have less students than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| than we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| Okay, I'm just looking at this contract. Okay, I can't, if I think of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| And just, just for clarification, this is the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| of the committee, so when this comes back to the board for discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5488)|
| 1:31:33| I mean, the board's still going to have to vote on a contract for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| superintendent. So that's true. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| I mean, that's true, but I mean, what, what the board would be doing with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| vote, and, and, and I see Ms. Owens' concern as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| well. I mean, I mean, so you may want to consider some friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| friendly amendment to call it a starting base salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| but, but, but what this board would be voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| is, is say, hey, you know, either, either we're going to start at $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| or, or if you all wanted to modify that in some way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| I mean, you know, the negotiations wouldn't go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| because this board would be saying that, that, that that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| that's really your minimum, and I think that's Mr. McMillan's point as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| All right. Go ahead. Okay, Ms. Owens. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| There's some, we did some very quick math and, you know, we know we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| not mathematicians over here. Anytime I... Yeah, well, thank you for doing the math| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| for us. When I go home and say, I did math in public, there's concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| So, just looking at, looking at this chart from the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| and comparing the superintendent's salary to the average daily membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| there's a very wide range for the superintendent. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| the first student cost, if we break that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| Williamson County is paying over seven dollars per student for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| superintendent, and Shelby is paying right at three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| dollars per student. We are slightly above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| that. Davidson is at 351. We are currently at 364.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5595)|
| 1:33:22| Hamilton is at 544. Sumner is at 688. So, if we went to 250, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5602)|
| 1:33:31| basically come in right in the middle of the pack around 438.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5611)|
| 1:33:39| And so, per student, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| kind of in line with more of what? I don't, I don't know what it would put us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| in line with. I can just say that of these, of these similar counties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| we've looked at, looking at it as a per student number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| it's basically right in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| Mr. McMillan. Thank you for sharing that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| Ms. Owen, but I don't really see that in this particular situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| much benefit as far as who we hire. I think they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5655)|
| 1:34:21| do a good job, or they're not going to do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| They'll do maybe a mediocre job, but I don't think it's going to be based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| on the amount of dollars per student. Now, if we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| talking about teacher salaries, then, you know, I might,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| I might be more inclined, but now I guess I have a question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| Dupler. If we would, let's just say for argument's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| sake, that we would hire somebody at two hundred and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5687)|
| 1:34:54| let's say, two hundred and forty thousand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| which is what Hamilton County used, you said, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| they came in, and at the end of the first year, we put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| them under a, like, a four-year contract, or a three-year, maybe a three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| because four-year contracts kind of, we haven't had the best of luck with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5715)|
| 1:35:20| four-year contracts for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5720)|
| 1:35:24| But, anyway, we have them under contract. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| after one year, if the board that is in power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| in this body, then, if they wanted to take a vote and tear up the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| and elevate the salary to three hundred thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| and issue a new contract three-year, four-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| there's nothing to prohibit that, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. McMillan, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| I'll do you one better. The board could come in after a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5762)|
| 1:36:07| and raise the salary and not change any other part of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| So the answer is yes, the salary could be raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| Well, just to add on comment, and I'll shut up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| the point is, I think that, you know, given a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5784)|
| 1:36:31| that we would have some indication of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| that person was doing, and then we would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| we might not want to raise it. We might just leave it, or we might raise it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| just slightly, but I think it would give us some indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| rather than, you know, just throwing figures out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| Thank you. All right, so we have a motion. Ms. Henderson, can you restate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5815)|
| 1:37:02| your motion? Yes, and we, with the help of Mr. Dupler, I think we've, Ms. Owen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| tweaked the wording to maybe be a little bit more clear in the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| so I'll restate the new motion. I make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| for the board to accept the recommendation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| superintendent search committee for a starting base salary. So if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| change to begin salary negotiations to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| for a starting base salary, with the rest of the motion being the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| with any potential candidate for superintendent at $250,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| not including employee benefits, and to allow the superintendent search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5860)|

| 1:37:49| evaluation framework. Would that be more clear? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| Okay, so Ms. Babb, you're agreeable. So we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| that motion and a second by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5879)|
| 1:38:07| So that would be my understanding with that motion, yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| With this motion, yes, it's a starting base salary. Yes, and that is correct and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| Mr. Dupler, right? If the board accepts that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| the minimum would be $250,000 at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| Okay. Ms. Horn. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Bolton, would you, as our HR director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5906)|
| 1:38:32| would you care to weigh in on this topic at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5912)|
| 1:38:36| Sure, Madam Chair. Thank you for this opportunity. You sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| hesitant there, Scott. You know, it's tough. I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| probably a good position to take if you're looking at prospective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| superintendents so they know whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| it would be worth them pursuing this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| You know, when you're looking at the school district of this size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| and the transparency that we have in Tennessee, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| very easily find the current salaries of superintendents across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| So in terms of being competitive, I mean, if you really have the idea of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| competitive in terms of salary, then by being public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| with that, I think you're going to have people to consider that position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| more people to consider that position given the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| the way that you've gone about this. But I mean, that's kind of my take on it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| terms of, I mean, we publish our teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| salaries and for the hopes that people will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| them and be inclined to apply for our position. So, you know, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| certainly is a good posture to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| Okay. So, Ms. Coatney, will you restate that just for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=5993)|
| 1:40:00| And Ms. Henderson's motion is for the board to accept the recommendation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| the superintendent search committee for a starting base salary of $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| I'm sorry, with any potential candidate for superintendent at $250,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| not including employee benefits and to allow the superintendent search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| committee to continue their work with TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| on developing the superintendent evaluation framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| And Ms. Papp seconded that motion. Okay. So, without any more discussion, can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| do a roll call vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| Ms. Owen? Yes. Mr. Watson? Yes. Ms. Babb? Yes. Ms. Horn? Yes. Ms. Henderson? Yes. Ms. Bounds? Yes. Mr. McMillan? No. Ms. Christy? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6034)|
| 1:40:51| Seven yes votes and one no vote. So, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| And we will move to public forum. Ms. Coatney? Thank you, Madam Chair. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| have one speaker tonight. Cynthia Finch, if you'd like to come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220105?start=6062)|
