| 0:01:23| moment of silence. We lost a great leader last week, former Commissioner Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=83.48)|
| 0:01:28| Strickland, better known as Tank. He was the first Democratic chair and black| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=88.36)|
| 0:01:34| person to share the County Commission, so that just shows how much, it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=94.36)|
| 0:01:40| Republican majority, but it shows how much people respected him as a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=100.92)|
| 0:01:45| and he will be greatly missed in our community and in Knox County, so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=105.84)|
| 0:01:49| just bow our heads for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=109.60000000000001)|
| 0:02:00| Thank you so much. So as I was thinking about Tank and talking to a former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=120.2)|
| 0:02:06| people that's been in office, such as State Representative Joe Armstrong and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=126.24000000000001)|
| 0:02:11| former Representative Rick Staples, just everybody's telling me how great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=131.6)|
| 0:02:15| of a man he was. And I also talked to former Mayor Rasdell and Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=135.56)|
| 0:02:23| Mike Arms, and they was telling me all the stories of how politics was when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=143.44)|
| 0:02:29| they was in office, and it seemed like it was so much more unity than it is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=149.36)|
| 0:02:33| when we look at what's going on in the nation and where we are, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=153.88)|
| 0:02:40| was kind of jealous. I'm like, man, it seems like, you know, it was more of like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=160.48000000000002)|
| 0:02:44| team. So what I was thinking of, I've been reading a book called Disruptive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=164.0)|
| 0:02:49| Thinking. It's by T.D. Jase. He's a mega pastor out of Texas, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=169.07999999999998)|
| 0:02:55| what's on my heart right now is just so much division that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=175.48)|
| 0:03:00| within us, within our communities, and it's like we can't find common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=180.76)|
| 0:03:05| ground, and I hope that we can disrupt our thinking by really just remembering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=185.92)|
| 0:03:10| the Great Commission that we are called to do, whether or not you believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=190.88)|
| 0:03:14| Christianity or not. When you look at different world scriptures, everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=194.84)|
| 0:03:19| is based and rooted in love, and I pray that we can get to the space that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=199.96)|
| 0:03:24| love our God, whoever your God is, and love yourself and heal yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=204.6)|
| 0:03:29| however that looks for you, and be bold enough to love others and including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=209.84)|
| 0:03:36| your enemies also. So I just really wanted to leave us with that. We can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=216.8)|
| 0:03:41| better because there's a whole nation out there. There's a whole community out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=221.8)|
| 0:03:46| there. There's a whole county out there that's waiting on us to come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=226.0)|
| 0:03:50| So I'm going to end this with a prayer. Let's bow our hands. God, thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=230.36)|
| 0:03:55| this moment. I thank you for this time. I thank you for the great leaders that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=235.0)|
| 0:03:58| you have appointed to be on this stage at this time. We might not always agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-business?start=238.20000000000002)|
