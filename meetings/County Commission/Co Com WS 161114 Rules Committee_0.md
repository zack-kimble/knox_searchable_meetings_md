| 0:00:20| You have in front of you. Well, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=20)|
| 0:00:23| let's do the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=23)|
| 0:00:24| Make a motion to approve the minutes from the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=24)|
| 0:00:30| Do you want to see the minutes, all three of them? Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=30)|
| 0:00:33| We've got three sets. Yeah. OK. All in favor. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=33)|
| 0:00:41| OK, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=41)|
| 0:00:47| We're going to discuss some rule changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=47)|
| 0:00:51| on commission regarding zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=51)|
| 0:00:52| Did you get the copy of a revised copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=52)|
| 0:00:57| Letter from Daniel. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=57)|
| 0:01:03| This is the original one, and then I put in a revised copy on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=63)|
| 0:01:09| Did you get to see it? No, but I don't vote. Oh, you don't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| But you got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| Then you can show it to me. We've got questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| Oh, do you? I've got both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| Yes. I got the Daniel Sanders letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| Yeah. Now you've got a second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| There was an email copy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| I didn't bring it. That's OK. I don't have that. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| That's the revised that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Yeah. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| What else are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Well, the first one is this one right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| And then we did the revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=114)|
| 0:01:56| There's two. There's two out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| There are two copies for the to look at the rules committee about zoning's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=119)|
| 0:02:06| One, there's another addendum that we did later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| giving the power to the full commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| to extend it instead of just being real harsh and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| if they're not here on the second one, it goes, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| Doesn't it have to be voted on in an affirmative to be action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| Well, I think the I think if you read the second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| you read the second rule that I think I think that's what I have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| OK. If you see the last line, it says, unless commission votes otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| And so it'll so if they don't show up month one, it rolls to month two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=162)|
| 0:02:48| Right. No action on month two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| It goes away and less commission votes otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| So we still have the power to extend it if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| But can it automatically be denied or will we have to vote at that second meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| They don't show up to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| That's. I guess that's a question for Bud, but that's what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Not deny. It just falls off the request is whatever the request is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| falls off the agenda. There's no action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| Shall be deemed denied due to the applicant's failure to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| Yeah, I don't think we should do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| because then you're restricting that property for a year. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| So it gives the commission a opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| to instead just let it go off that we can vote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Do we run into any possible legal action for taking action on a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| when no one is present to represent it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| Only if everybody's on notice to what the procedure is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=230)|
| 0:03:53| and they have due process going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| You'll have to give notice through the zoning application of this rule change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=235)|
| 0:04:02| and give it some, you know, 30, 60, 90 days out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| before it goes into effect, I would, once you vote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=247)|
| 0:04:12| But really, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| Well, I don't know how you're going to say the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| So if you if you have in your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| the option to extend or deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=261)|
| 0:04:27| You'll have to think on how you're going to word it to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| due process strong on the backside of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| You know what I'm trying to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| What about what about taking out the word denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| and putting the word withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| So unless commission votes otherwise, the application shall be deemed withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| due to the applicant's failure to attend at any subsequent zoning session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=284)|
| 0:04:49| and then are back to square zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Does the commission have the power to withdraw something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| Well, because of your rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| that you have the power to vote on anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| and their own notice that you either attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| or your application terminates at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| In other words, that's your whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| As long as they as long as they have due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| and as long as you have the option to either deny it or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| extend it or not extend it's the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| Couldn't that be part of their application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Yes. They're understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Right. That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| As long as they understand what the due process is and how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| then you all can vote any way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| The only way you can't vote is if they're not on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| So when they do it, and that's why I was saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| it would have to be out into the future a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| because there could be some applications out there under the old rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| that you really shouldn't apply that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Right. Because they won't have proper actual notice as to what can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| But once they have notice as to what can occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| when they're applying as part of their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| then their own notice, if they don't show, it's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| They're actually withdrawing by no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| It's like a pass vote is a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| No show to them is I'm withdrawing after whatever number you say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| And then, you know, if they don't like it, they can sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| We'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| The reason why I was thinking about that clause in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| if there was some unforeseen consequences that came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=376)|
| 0:06:19| that they couldn't be here on the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| Yeah. And they called in and said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| Well, what that reason is a good, legitimate reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| that we could defer it for one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| So we're not denying them, you know, the due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| We'll say that we're going to give you an extra 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| for that applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| And I just wanted to protect the people that have the applicants out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| Whatever you're going to do, you need it in your room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| I mean, if you're going to have an option where they can call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| and you need to stay, otherwise, you know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Whatever it is you're going to do, you need to have it in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=414)|
| 0:06:57| Needs to be clear so that all the applicants understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| what the rule is, and then they can call in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| And you may say, we'll extend it for one more 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=425)|
| 0:07:08| or they keep calling in, then you keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| I mean, whatever you decide, whatever your policy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| But you you need to make what all the options are clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=433)|
| 0:07:16| so they'll know what they are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| Now, will this go on the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| Do we need to put this on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| that they're filing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| OK, can I give you my thoughts of what I was thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| Maybe we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| That might be fair to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| And I know we don't have a tabled agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| but I was thinking if they don't show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| after the first time automatically postpone it second time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| they don't show up, we table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Now, a lot of people worry about tabling because you can show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| at the next meeting and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| I want to bring that off the table and be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| But we could have a rule where you can't be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| the day it's brought off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| It has to go to the next meeting so everybody's got notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=475)|
| 0:08:03| I'm just worried about somebody getting in a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| where they can't call in, an emergency comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Yes, Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| I apologize, Mr. Chairman, for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=490)|
| 0:08:13| But this slide's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| I agree with the Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| and Commissioner Anders that that word denied means withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| So they can't bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| And the law director might say, I know in BZA, we run across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| a night, someone that would call the day of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| the meeting at 11 o'clock and say, I want to withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| or I want to postpone it another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| That time limit needs, we came up with a time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| I think it was two days prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| They had to be noticed or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| So we do need a hard, just from past experience on BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| we need a hard time limit in there and it must be followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| But on that day, if there was an unforeseen, like an accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| or something like that, where the person, the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| Could not be here, you know, and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=538)|
| 0:09:02| So if you withdraw it, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| they have the opportunity to come back and reapply the same exact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| If you deny it, they got to wait a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| Right. I think we're talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| I think we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| I think we all agree that the withdrawal needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| the denied needs to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| But now we're talking about setting the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Parameters in which they can delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| which we've already got to that, we've already crossed the bridge of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| denied needs to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Cross that out and fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Now we're talking about delaying procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| How can they do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| And if there's a time limit applied, you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| So, well, my understanding is that if it's withdrawn that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| it's supposed to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=589)|
| 0:09:50| And we find out later that they were in a car accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| You know, God forbid something like that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| They can reapply whatever that fee is for that same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| They won't be denied totally 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| They got an option that there's another way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| So if that does happen, ever happens, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| They can go back and apply the 200 dollar fee or 400 dollar fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| And here it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Some of them are twelve, fifteen hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Well, whatever it is, I mean, I mean, do we penalize somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| for an unforeseen consequence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Just want to protect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Mr. Law Director, do we have a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| I know BZA, we had the right to waive a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| Does the commission have a right to do that or is that through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| That's PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| The fee doesn't in this instance belongs to another organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| So you can't waive that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| I've heard the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| So what we're trying to do here is make it more streamlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| You know, you have people that just don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| They know they're supposed to be here, don't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| And we want to deal with them in a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| But you have good people that for some reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| may not be able to get here for the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=665)|
| 0:11:07| And now and how do we protect them now if it's withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| Well, they have to go back through the MPC process, not just pay the fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| but they'll have to go back through the zoning process through MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| because it I mean, it terminates it. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| It it terminates it without a perpetual 12 month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| hold on the property for the same person's zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| I mean, you can come back a shorter period of time for a different zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| but you can't come back for what you had applied for the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| if it is denied under your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| Right now, we changed it to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| If you're withdrawn, you can come back at a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| But I think you probably have to with you, you would have to reapply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| that you can reapply for the same zoning. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| But you'd have to go back through the whole process to MPC again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| It wouldn't be like you just come back to us. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=714)|
| 0:12:02| So what suggestions do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=722)|
| 0:12:08| Nobody like table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| Well, I mean, that's what I wanted to explain what tabling means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| That's what really tabling is, what you're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| To table an item at a meeting says it can't come back during this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| but it can come back at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| some some meeting following this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| It is indefinite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| You're suspending it indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| And that's what you're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| So you're actually tabling something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| The other and that's what MPC does, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| I don't know what MPC does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| They have items table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Remember, we had that question of could a zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| while there was an item already on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| Well, if I table something, it's it's postponed indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| The other rule to a table is postponed to a time certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Those are the two deferral actions that you take under the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| that are beyond the Robert rules, not the commission rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=779)|
| 0:13:04| So if you use the word table or not, that's what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| In essence, right now, you're tabling something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| You can't deal with it anymore this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| but it can be dealt with to some future meeting into perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| The other one is postponed to a time certain and you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| You know, if they didn't come, you postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| That's the two actions you can take to keep it from being denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| Otherwise, you do not. And then it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| So how are you want to package those options as a policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| Well, I think I'm really I mean, to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| the reason we're here is because that one on Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| everybody's having a discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| And so, I mean, it gets into contractual stuff at times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| where you've got somebody on the hook and then they change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| And then, you know, maybe that changes the whole game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| And so I think some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| having them present and if you want to put time constraints on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| But the commission, I think, is wise to have flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| where things like that were a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| You could have a contract on Monday and Wednesday. It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| And so restricting that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| Based on that contract or somebody back now, I mean, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| I if you want to clean it up a little bit, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| But I think being so with the more strict that you draw it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| the less flexibility the commission has and sometimes you can kill a deal for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| And I think that could be bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| You could always put a third month in there if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| The first month they don't show is the automatic deferment to the second month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| Then the commissioner can make a motion to defer it one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| And if they don't show up the third month, then it can be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| The problem with the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| With with just pushing it to the next month's agenda is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| The people that may show up to protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| Are going to show up every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| That's why I kind of like the table idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| That way they know it's not coming back up and then have a rule in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| where they can't just show up at a meeting, say, I want to bring that off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| the table and vote on that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| It has to go to the next meeting before it can be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| I personally don't like the table myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Myself, either it's on there or it's off of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| One of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| We've got to send a recommendation to the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=937)|
| 0:15:45| And like I said, the reason why it was brought up during the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| meeting, someone said, you know, that this keeps going on and on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| And there's even with your new rule, it can go on and on and on because it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| unless commission votes otherwise, which I think the flexibility is good, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| this doesn't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| If we pass this, it doesn't change what happened to Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| It can keep going on and on and on and on with six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| It just gives us an option to, at some point, vote to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| That's the only thing that changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| We couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Correct me, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| We could not vote it down last month because we felt like that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| may not have had the proper notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| If we pay something now, we have proper notice and it can be denied in the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Can't go back on this guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| No, not on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I mean, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| And if you were talking about the future, we're talking about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| We're talking about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Once you make a policy change and you get public notice and you give everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| that's applying in the future that proper notice that the rules have changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| then from that point on, that application, that's why I said earlier, and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| weren't here at the time, Carson, that we need to set it up 30, 60, 90 days after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| the effective date after commission votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And that way you give time to put it in the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| And then at that certain date, every application has that notice and that part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| of due process in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| Everybody's on notice then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| So then the commission can do what it does, you know, according to its rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1040)|
| 0:17:35| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1055)|
| 0:17:35| Law Director, is there any other unforeseen consequences if we go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| do what we're talking about right now that could affect an applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| Well, truthfully, I'm not clear on what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| I'm not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1070)|
| 0:17:50| But anyway, we're going to try to work on the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Haven't I mean, these words with the change of denial to withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| Well, I thought we were talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| What we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1078)|
| 0:18:07| It's the email from Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1087)|
| 0:18:21| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1101)|
| 0:18:37| Shall be withdrawn due, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| Withdrawn to the applicant's failure to attend any subsequent session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| I think that would probably work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| You're not freezing the property for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1130)|
| 0:18:50| Zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I think that'd be a little harsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| Do you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1136)|
| 0:18:56| Do you want to make it like Carson was talking about a third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| I mean, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| But I think not having a flexibility is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| But do you want to add that third month in there or do you let the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| votes otherwise just be your potential third month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Yeah, yeah, that's a policy thing you've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| You've got the flexibility, which says, you know, unless you all vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1159)|
| 0:19:24| otherwise, it gives you you can vote not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| But then what happens if you vote not to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| Does that put it into perpetuity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| That's the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| What does the vote not to do it mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| And extend one more month and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| Does the process start over again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| You know, you've got to have the process solid before you vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| That's back again in the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| So so if you you need to have your alternatives, if you have alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| And what does that mean to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| Well, I'm with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Commissioner Daley on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| Two months in the third month, we take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| I mean, anybody can forget an appointment, shouldn't forget these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| Anybody can have an accident, but for things to happen three times in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| that's getting kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| On the edges of possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| and two after the second month, I don't know if we give notice or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| but after a second month, commission office can send them a letter stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| that if they don't show up the third time, it will be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| The process will have to be reinstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| So we but then, as the law director said, if after the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| Third meeting, we decide to postpone it to the otherwise, what is the rule then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| Does it kick back to the beginning of this or does it go month to month at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| Well, that could be I would automatically say that could be made in a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| I'd make a motion that we hear this at the next regular schedule agenda meeting to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| And if it's to be heard and if it's not heard, it's denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| Withdrawn or withdrawn, withdrawn or withdrawn, withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1284)|
| 0:21:24| I think there's ways around it by correct me, Mr. Law Director's ways around it by making a motion commission, making a motion at some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1284)|
| 0:21:33| You effectively you can do it that way, but the but the applicant would not be on notice as to their notice is that it would be denied or be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1293)|
| 0:21:45| That's all they would know by not showing under your application unless you're going to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1305)|
| 0:21:51| That's all they would know by not showing under your application unless you told them what would happen on the otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| And if you do it by motion, they still won't know what would happen otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| They would assume by rule that it has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| I would I'm talking about the third month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1331)|
| 0:22:11| The third month, the second month, they will have a letter stating from the county commission that they will be heard at the next scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1331)|
| 0:22:19| And then say somebody in my district calls and says, Commissioner, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| I want to be there, but I can't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| Then I would ask for 30 days, no more than 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1351)|
| 0:22:31| Is there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| Depends who the caller is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| If the caller is the applicant, that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1356)|
| 0:22:36| It had to be an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| But if but if if the applicant doesn't show even after the letter and for some reason you all do otherwise, they don't know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1358)|
| 0:22:48| If they don't know what the otherwise possibilities are, they won't even know to call in or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Would we send this letter like a certified mail so that they had the sign so that they couldn't say, well, I never got the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| Because we know that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1383)|
| 0:23:12| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| I mean, yeah, I had no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I don't know if we did it and BZA certified it, but they were put on notice by codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| Codes Department put them on notice that they needed to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| A lot of times they I'm going to say a lot of times because there wasn't that many times they would come back and they would automatically withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| It wouldn't be on the agenda for the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| After codes had got a hold of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| And I believe we'd probably run into the same situation that commission office in a letter that it's going to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| Yeah, withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Make sure I use the right word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| They probably wouldn't show up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| I mean, withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| They'd probably go ahead and withdraw it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| If if it was stated in there, and I hope I get this correct to protect the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| If we say, OK, we notify the applicant that we're withdrawing his application and the otherwise would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1443)|
| 0:24:17| If you make a motion, as Commissioner Daley has expressed, the motion would be the notice on the third time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1457)|
| 0:24:26| Otherwise, then you could say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| If commission takes other action, the applicant would be notified of the motion and that leaves you the flexibility of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1471)|
| 0:24:41| But it also puts the applicant on notice what the motion was, so they'll know that we deferred it 30 days or whatever it is you all decided that night, because that gives you all kinds of flexibility and still leaves them due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1481)|
| 0:24:56| Well, I think, you know, we've talked a little bit about the developer and flexibility, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| But if you get somebody up here and I don't mind it being reset a couple of times, but do they just use this as a method to get rid of the opposition or they quit coming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1502)|
| 0:25:18| So I think we got to be careful that we so extend it to where there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| If there's opposition to something, we so extend it to where they just give up, you know, and put some confusion into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| So that we need to be adding that third month, does that do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| I think we need to be careful with that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| You know, at first I kind of thought, well, the third month does sound good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| But adding that third month really gives them the ability to wear out the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1540)|
| 0:25:48| Well, if I was opposition on the third month, I'd be here saying, your rules say you withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| Yeah, but shouldn't they have to come three times for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Well, I agree with you there, but if that's the case, I'd say then let's do it on the second month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| That way they only have to come twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| But we're not, we want to be fair, so I think the third month would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| And just like the law director has stated, put it in there that if I change it for some reason, they are notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1572)|
| 0:26:20| And it'll be due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Are we going to add that as an add to what we've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Or do we need to strike some of the things that we've already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| What was it you were going to want to add again, a statement of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Well, you would amend the one you have from deny to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| And put in a sentence on the end to the effect, if commission acts otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| then the motion would be sent to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| Something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Whatever that motion is that commission acted on would be sent to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1621)|
| 0:27:07| Via certified mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| Yeah, because I don't know what that motion would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| You know, you all, it'd be fact-driven every time, whatever made you not withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| I think I may have it already rewritten here, so let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| Attendance at the zoning session by the applicant or representative for a reason of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| or rezoning or plan amendment shall be required for commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| If the applicant is not present when the item is first read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| it shall automatically be placed at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| If the applicant is not present when the item is reached again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| then the item shall be placed on the agenda for the following month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| for the applicant's failure to attend only once automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| Unless the commission votes otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| the application shall be deemed withdrawn due to the applicant's failure to attend at any subsequent zoning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| If the commission acts otherwise, the motion would be sent to the applicant via certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| Does that take care of everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| Now, does that mean that an applicant doesn't show up one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| It rolls once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| It rolls once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| It rolls once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| We could at that point, if they call, say, I had a car accident on the way here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| we could roll it again by a vote to roll it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| They would be sent a notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Okay, what if they don't show up at the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| Do we start back at D1 again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| Wouldn't it be up to the commission to decide what they're going to do at that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| to go ahead and withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| We would make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Make a motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Could we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| I would deal with it in the motion that I made to extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| I would say something to the effect, I make a motion that we extend this 30 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| However, if the applicant fails to show again, it will be automatically withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| And then that would be sent out in your letter to the applicant, and they're all on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| And then when it comes up again, you're right back to where you were before you extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| I just don't want to create a loophole where you can, you see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| You can ask for an extended, then do a no-show, and then ask for an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Well, you can continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| That's up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| But commission, you know, you take six votes to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| And if you all as a body don't want to keep doing it, it's withdrawn somewhere along the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| But that way it's not perpetuity automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| Would you all like me to send this to you on e-mail real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| You know, on that, Commissioner Smith, on that second notice, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| we can do on that second no-show, that in the certified letter that the motion was made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1811)|
| 0:30:19| that if they do not appear at the next regular scheduled zoning meeting, it will be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| Number three comes up, they don't show, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| That's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| So that's three chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| Not two, but three chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| But three chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1838)|
| 0:30:56| Who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Randy, Bud, Michelle, me, Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1860)|
| 0:31:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| Can you read it one more time so we can hear it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| We don't have any unforeseen consequences in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| Attendance at the zoning session by the applicant or a representative for a rezoning or plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| shall be required for commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| If the applicant is not present when the item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| there's a typo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| when the item is first read, it shall automatically be placed at the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| If the applicant is not present when the item is reached again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| the item shall be placed on the agenda for the following month of the applicant's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| for the applicant's failure to attend only once automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| Unless the commission votes otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| the application shall be deemed withdrawn due to the applicant's failure to attend at any subsequent zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| If commission acts otherwise, the motion would be sent to the applicant via certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1925)|
| 0:32:16| Does that cover everything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| That gives them notice on what it is your intentions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| because you voted on the motion and said here's what we're going to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| And you sent it to them and saying here's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| We didn't withdraw it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| but here's what we're going to do if you don't show the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| That's what this motion would address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| And if they decide not to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| then they're acquiesced to whatever the commission's will is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| Okay, can I have a motion that we send this recommendation to full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1969)|
| 0:32:57| I make a motion that we send it to full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| You need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Who's a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Any opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Okay, we can have this ready for next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| No, next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| Next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| It's not on the agenda now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I wouldn't, I mean, next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2006)|
| 0:33:32| Okay, the next item on the agenda is discussion item number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| Discussion for suggestion of changes in the commission's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| regarding roads and drives on the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| We have roads and drives, you know, approval of roads on one part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| and then at one part we have a closure at another section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| And I just thought it would be cleaner to have all the roads, drives, closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| all in one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| The ones in the back, the road closures have to be voted on twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| and so if you're going to do roads and drives, you move it to the back of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| They have to be read twice, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| They're like an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| I think it is an ordinance, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| I wonder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Is the closure of a road an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| Or does it just have to be read twice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| I don't know what's classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| I'll have to check on that, but it is read twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| It just seems like it would be more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| if somebody's looking for something that all roads, drives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| whatever you're doing to it, it would be in one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| I would move the, if you're going to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| one of them's a resolution, one of them's an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| but if you're going to do that, I'd move the roads and drives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| to the back where the closures are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| But you still have the one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| It would be a little bit cleaner, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Okay, I mean, it's up to Jolie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| She puts it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| There's a section that says drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| So if it's a road, it's a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| So if we could just put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| Right now it's just closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Second is down, like the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| although there's no resolution number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| it's just second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| So we're proposing the same closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| I'll make a motion that we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| to put both items in the same section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| All opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| All in favor say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Now, the other thing I've got down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| is discussion of meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| I've had some people ask to see what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| right now, the times we're meeting right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| and what they were before to take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| and see if people wanted to change it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| like it was when, back in, was it 2014| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| when we changed it, 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| When we first got on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| we had times to meet like at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| You see me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2160)|
| 0:36:08| Speak to a different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2177)|
| 0:36:28| What are they saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| So you want to put it on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| This, about changing the times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| that'll have to be put on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Can a non-member speak to the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| on a different topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2205)|
| 0:36:51| Who's the person that wants to speak on a different topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| There's no public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| It's on a topic that's already been voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| and it'll be before commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| I can speak to the public forum then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| if it's just something I want to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| the rules committee on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| It's at the discretion of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| That one down there on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Otherwise, the answer's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Otherwise, the answer's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| It's at the discretion of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| I can't hear you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| Could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| I said anything this board has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| outside its agendas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| is at the discretion of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| And if you're going to add something to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| it takes two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| I've got the agenda down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I thought it was already on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| There's other business on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| But we haven't got through our agenda yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Let's get through the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| because it's getting close to where we get paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| About changing the meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| The only suggestion I would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| you just popped in my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| I didn't know you was going to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| is that we move zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| to, say, 6.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| because a lot of times we're done by 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| That's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| If you leave it at 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| it doesn't matter to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| but we're sitting here for 30 to 40 minutes sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| But then, on the other hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| I see Brad shaking his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| You're going to make Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Mr. Vanderveet, and all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| sit here for a longer period of time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| There's a positive and a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| There's a positive and a negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| What will happen with that compression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| is that, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| you're changing zoning times again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| It confuses people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| Number two, you've yet to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| with a fairly new commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| through a budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| Two or three months of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| are going to be long commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| So you stop commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| you held up everybody that's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| for a commission discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| to go to zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| and then you just start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| a lot of starting and stopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| We've gotten away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| I think it's been very refreshing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| for those to be extended between each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| 30 minutes is not going to make any difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| in whether or not it's efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| I can always be shot down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| I won't shoot you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Just a little experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Do we have any other discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| on the times of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Do we have anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| Did we have anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| who wants to speak on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| Do we need to send it to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| at all to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| I'm asking a question among the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I think we should leave it where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| I've said all along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| we're supposed to be running| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| an open and transparent government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| that's accessible to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| on their time, not ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| And I think we're one of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| We were one of the very few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| government entities in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| that was able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Ditto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| So are we going to have no action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| on that discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Well, it does seem like...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| Now, through the winter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| when it gets dark so early,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| people are coming up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I mean, it's dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Try to find a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| I know a little lady that came last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| She was going out, and she fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Thank goodness it was still daylight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| to help her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| She broke her glasses and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| But it is late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| and it's dark during the winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| with this change of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| And from what I've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| we have less people attend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| our commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| than we ever have before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| that I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| That's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| We don't seem to have as much participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2456)|
| 0:40:58| because it is later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2458)|
| 0:41:00| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Does it matter to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| I mean, I can come anytime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| the day that we do them, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| I don't have no wisecracks down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| Do I have any motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| that we want to send this on to commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| or just kind of let it slide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Motion to make it let it slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Any opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| So we'll take that one up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2490)|
| 0:41:31| So we'll take that one off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| Now, other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| Let me bring up something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| that this may be a little controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| We have a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| called court committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| that has no functionality to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| that we have on our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| that we fill with committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| But they don't meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| They have no function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Most of that's taking care of the judges now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| And I was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| if we need to take that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| off of our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| off of what we fill with other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| I believe that's a state requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| They used to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| They used to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| as it related to the judges and the magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| They don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| The way the resolutions have shifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| to where the letter comes from the judges anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| there's nothing for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| The other thing they used to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| and look at the courts and the courtrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| I mean, there's things for them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| They're just not caught on a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| It's kind of like the grand jury, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| used to go through and evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| And they still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| And this body was set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| to go and look at recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| from the grand jury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| and look at our facilities, safety and security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| And they would deal with the reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| that the law director's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| in the sheriff's office for you all now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| There's a function for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| I don't recall whether it's a state mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| or not, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| I can look that up for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| but I just don't have it off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| But there's things for them to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| if they wanted to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| But the main part of what their duties are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| is to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| The judges already take care of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| to appoint magistrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| because I think we're going to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| come up before us again pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| But they just send recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| to us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| The judges are required by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| to send recommendations to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| It doesn't preclude any other applications coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| And that would be reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| by the judiciary committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| The recommendation would be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| But the resolution really states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| that the judges vet these people first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| And that took that role away from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| That was the main part of that committee, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| It was one of their functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| they used to look at the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| and any recommendations the judges had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| as courtrooms, safety and security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| report that to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| to report the report to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| But those other things are being done otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| because they haven't been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| The grand jury's been handling by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| It goes over and evaluates the jails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| and all that type stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| And so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| it could be something that was deferred or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| I'd have to check on the status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| as to whether it's statutorily required or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I just don't know off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| So are we required to have that committee now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| That's what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| I'd have to check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| Well, do we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| to wait for that recommendation from the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| and just kind of go off of that one right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| bring it back up to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Do we have to have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| No, it's new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| You don't have to have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| It'll be new business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| We'll look forward to that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Do we have any other business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| that you want to discuss on rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| It's against my better judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| but Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| what do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| I'll take a motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| This is just a procedure thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| the way our agenda is laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| I was wondering if we took the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| that are for the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| to go to the back of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| and the action items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| for the different county departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| come to the front of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| And the commission office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| can't do that on their own accord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| They would have to have direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| from this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| to be able to make that adjustment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| It just seems like when you start the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| it should roll through with all the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| that are pertinent to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| And since we cannot take any action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| on the school items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| that those go towards the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| just prior to the line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| A suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| What does the committee think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| about this suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| If we do have questions about items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| that we can't take action on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| from the school's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| there are certain days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| that they have meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| that are right up against ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| So they might not be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| to answer those questions like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2805)|
| 0:46:51| Because I have three, 11, 19, and 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| I guess so with lack of interest in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| It's not lack of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| I'm the newbie here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| so I'm kind of deferring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| to my senior commissioners for advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| The senior one here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| I get the gist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| of why Schoomaker wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| That way we don't hold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| the county employees here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| but I think we would run into a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| if we actually had questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| about something that we waited to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| at 6 o'clock when they leave here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| at 5.30 to go over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| for their meeting at 5.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Do they ever have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| the same day we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Every work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2858)|
| 0:47:44| Do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS161114RulesCommittee?start=2870)|
