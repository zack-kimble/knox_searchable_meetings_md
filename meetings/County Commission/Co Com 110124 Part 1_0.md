| 0:11:51| Yes, sir. Have you completed a server training program? Yes, I did. All right, thank you. So I'm going to ask these folks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| your left, my right, a few questions. Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| Sheriff's department? No problem. Beer board inspector? No problem. Codes? No problem. Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| Application for permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=726)|
| 0:12:11| All right, I'll defer to the commission, Mr. Chairman. Do we have a motion? So moved, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| Second. Motion has been made and seconded. All those in favor? Motion passes. We're now moving to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| discussion items. Thank you, sir. Discuss drive-thru beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| I'm not sure who had this on the agenda. Mr. Law Director. Yes, the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| quite a few months back asked me to look into the feasibility of determining whether or not we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| or could have a county-wide ordinance that essentially precluded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| drive-thru beer permits. I engaged the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| Technical Advisory Service and the Institute for Public Service to do some basic research for us, which gives you an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| of the smattering of counties that actually have these permits. But in the interim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| the state attorney general has issued an opinion that I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| well supported by competent case law that the county is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| empowered to just have a blanket no drive-thru beer sales policy. Rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| we'd have to look at each individual applicant to see whether or not that particular applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| poses a threat to the local community by way of health welfare and safety, perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| traffic congestion, et cetera. So in a nutshell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| I don't think we should try to move forward with an ordinance, but rather just look at each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| individual drive-thru beer applicant on its own merit. That would be the safe and legally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| defensible way to approach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| If not the second item, 6B, is to discuss karaoke piracy issues. So let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| begin our discussion on that. I was asked to come to Mayor Burchett's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| I was going to say that Commissioner Smith is going to demo this before we start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| He does a great job of singing feelings, so we can have him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| I was asked to come to a meeting at Mayor Burchett's office and there we had representatives from Karaoke Cafe and another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| organization talking about the issues that they face with what we call illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| karaoke piracy issues. It's a very serious matter because you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| about millions of dollars in lost revenue to those who are legitimate business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=862)|
| 0:14:27| What happens is that people who operate karaoke establishments, they will get their music through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=867)|
| 0:14:32| illegal downloads, through just taping or making copies of someone's music, or they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| get it from those who are selling it when they shouldn't be selling it. So for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| legitimate businesses, it is an issue and it does represent lost revenue. They've actually had to lay people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| off and cut back on the scope of their business. We have some representatives here from Karaoke Cafe who can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| address this, but one of the things that we had talked about doing in the Mayor's office, and Mayor Burchett agreed, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| that we send a letter from the beer board to those who have karaoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| informing them of the law, because it is a federal law, and it does carry substantial penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| So rather than us going and trying to do something, it's more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| informative thing at this point to let them know of what the law is and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| make them aware of it and to ask them to please comply. So with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| I'll be asking, if it's all right, if we ask our law director to go ahead and send a letter just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| discussing the fact that this is a problem, asking them to comply with the law, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| that was pretty much what we discussed. But again, the folks are here from karaoke and Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I guess I'm trying to understand what context we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| approaching this from. When you say the beer board, in terms of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| are there any restrictions based on alcohol sales? Is that why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| sending it from the beer board and not just from County Commission and why we're discussing this in beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| Because to me it seems like a violation of the law, independent of where alcohol is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| We could send it, yes, you're right. We could send it on behalf of County Commission, but this was the proper venue, because most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| businesses that do karaoke also sell beer or alcohol. Okay, I would suggest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| From the Commission. Okay, Commissioner Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| If we do this, is this going to affect the lawsuits that are now pending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| in an adverse way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| I'll ask our Mr. Law Director, if we send a letter from County Commission just informing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| of the law and asking them to comply with the law, does this have anything to do with any pending lawsuits with this adversity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| No, sir. I mean, you're putting them on notice just essentially of the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| of the Commission to enforce its current laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| But again, the Commission is really not empowered to file civil lawsuits because we're not a party in interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:52| Our interest is in enforcing our beer ordinance. And if someone's conducting any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| illegal activity, that puts their license in jeopardy. But just merely an advisory letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| putting them on notice assists us if we have to go to court, because then they can, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| claim that they were not on notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| My concern was that, number one, that it would not affect anything that is pending now, because what I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| there's about 20 so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| My second question would be, is this going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| a ticketable offense by whom? The beer inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| How are we going to wait and depend on lawsuits to be filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| in this? Or how are we going to control it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| What is our obligations with regards to this, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Of any of these, everything from gambling machines to something of this nature, it would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| really consist of either a complaint being filed with the Sheriff's Department or during a routine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| inspection, it's in plain view that it's occurring. But beyond that, if you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| actually try to have a more aggressive enforcement action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| you can obviously see the mechanics involved there. You're going to have to get involved with the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| possibly additional manpower. I think what a letter normally does, it dissuades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| at least 90 percent of the people who are tempted to do this. You're always going to have your hardcore violators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| just like you do with gambling machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| Well, we presumably have 20 offenders right now, presumably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| What is our relationship to them? Are they going to be brought before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| We can't do it until after the lawsuits, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| No, the intent here is not to aggressively enforce this or to bring people here. It's just as an information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Most people don't know. I mean, they're not aware of the fact that if they buy music from an illegal distributor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| and they may not even know they're illegal distributors. And so the whole purpose of this is just to inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| them a letter asking them to comply with the law and to just comply with any of the music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| that they buy that they buy from reputable vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| Any other comments? I mean, do we need a formal action that we send a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| on behalf of the commission from the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| It's a discussion item, so do we need a formal action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| That's the express will of the commission. Again, since it's not a resolution or an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| we can certainly generate a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| If it's okay with the commission, we'll just ask the law director to send a letter, and so we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| Our next item is a discussion of the method for measuring distance. Did you folks have anything you wanted to say from the karaoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| I would just like to thank everybody. We really appreciate your help in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| I know there's not a lot you can do. We're doing the most of the work, but your support is greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| Great. Thank you. Our next item is discussion of the method for measuring distance requirements for beer establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| Our beer inspector asked me to put this on the agenda, so, UK, if you'll tell us what you're wanting us to look at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| Mr. Chairman, back in 76, the state county restricted Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| and we got an ordinance back in 93 stating 500 foot from residential to commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:22| residential or agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| We've done, for 19 years, the closest point of the building to the property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| and the reason we've done that, we can't use a church or a school anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| But what we looked at was in residential or agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| any church or school is built mostly on agricultural property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:58| And I would like for you all to exactly how you want it measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| Some says from property line to property line. We went from building to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| So if you all put that in an ordinance the way that you want it done, we're going to know how to do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:22| Mr. Jarrett, is this a resolution we need or how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| I'd like to look into this because, again, the Tennessee Code does provide for patios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| and appurtenances there through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| It's very difficult to have a one-size-fits-all policy, but we'd also have to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| You've got to remember there's also the underlying code dealing with our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| It could affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| So before we start rewriting both the zoning code and the bureau ordinance, I'll need to investigate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| look into it, report back to us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| Mr. Chairman, looking at the state for a little bit of guidance, the August 2010 revision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| they use building to building as their measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| So I just want to point that out, opening the discussion for where do we want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| And then there is one other thing that I want to say something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| Just in passing conversation, commissioners no longer compose the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| but as I read this 2010 edition of the state beer regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| the only place that the word beer can be spoken and something done to regulate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:58| is either through the county legislative body or its appointed beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| It so happens we said it's both, but I believe in the last couple of months there has been something before the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| about a distance related to beer, and I believe that we need to all be reminded that the only place you speak about beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1392)|
| 0:23:20| would be with county commission or with a sitting beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| I think in the instance, Commissioner, what you're dealing with is an individual went before the BZA and asked for a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| and I believe the purpose of the variance was to be able to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| That's correct, and the distance in that particular appeal was, the appeal was based on distance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| and the only organization in Knox County that can set that distance is the sitting commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| Not even the beer board can change the distance, it's the commission that the legislative body controls the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1430)|
| 0:23:59| And there's no appeal to that, that's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| If we're going by state law, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| Well, you know, you've deferred these decisions to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| That's why I said earlier that needs to be investigated because we have too many possibly competing statutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:21| and I've looked at this before, but we do need to take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| Mr. Chairman, I made a mistake on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| So I wanted to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| One other issue that's come up, I'd just like to kind of throw out here for a little discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| is the fact that with the advent of liquor being passed a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| we're starting to get some permits, applications in for places in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1490)|
| 0:24:58| and our qualifications differ from the state laws as far as who can and what can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1498)|
| 0:25:07| What I understand, that state law on liquor must govern over anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| So we need to be looking at maybe making our qualifications the same as the state qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1513)|
| 0:25:22| for being able to get accommodations, a beer and liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| Well, the state's preempted all liquor licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Liquor by the drink, we can't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| You can deal with beer only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| But we can make ours match the state's, is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| So you want to think about taking your beer ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| and maybe it could comport to the state liquor requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| You want me to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Well, if you're going to have to issue a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| we're going to have to have some basic qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| And if they can get liquor but no beer, it doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:06| If they get liquor by state law, we have to give them a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| If they get liquor first, we have to give them beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| But is there a way around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Would that have to go through BCA if it didn't pass this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I mean, if you're talking about changing the qualifications currently in your beer ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| as a legislative body, you can change those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| You know, the only thing you can't do is deviate from state law because the state does preempt all liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| It does monitor the manner in which we issue beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| For instance, we can't deny someone a permit merely because the prevailing community says we don't want beer in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| But we can certainly, you know, when we drafted the beer ordinance, we made sure that we were in consonance with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| State law is currently evolving in terms of liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| And if you're looking to have our policies more mirror the qualifications that the state requires of liquor licensees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| we can certainly look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| It's your ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| As long as we're in comport with state law, we can pretty much do quite a bit of inventive legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:14| Is that something we need to look into further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| I'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| I know that somebody told me here there was two or three applications coming up that we're going to have to go maybe to, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| BZA or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| Well, again, there's a distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| If it's going before the BZA, they're looking for a variance of their property lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| They're not getting a beer permit issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| That's about what it is, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| Nevertheless, any of these issues we can certainly research and get back with you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| It's always good to take a fresh look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| And, you know, again, it's an evolving body of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| Your ordinance should certainly mirror that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Any other business to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| If not, we are adjourned until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=1674)|

| 0:38:53| I didn't prepare to say anything particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| I do know that Chet is watching, and he's one of your biggest fans per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| He's one of the citizens in Knoxville and Knox County that always watches County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| but he has been a tireless worker within our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| and a great team member that we will definitely miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| He always helps out and pays attention whenever there's an issue that we're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| that affects our community and our community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| so we thank him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| My name is Nick Arning, 618 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| I've had the privilege of working with Chet for about 25 years in all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| not all of those committees and commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| but I was impressed hearing him and I knew about most of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And when I think of what he does, I think of a quote from Dwight Eisenhower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| who once said, it's amazing what we can get done when no one cares who gets the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| This fits Chet perfectly because most of us don't even know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| those that have known him for 25 years or more don't know of all the activities he's been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| And for that reason, I think this honor that you are bestowing upon him today is very richly deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2412)|

| 0:44:17| And I'm going to save some of my comments to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| There are several people that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| And this is Dan's wife and his daughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2662)|

| 0:44:27| And some other people want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Who wants to speak first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| I would just like to say that my father would be very humbled by this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2675)|

| 0:44:48| And my family and I are very appreciative of this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| I graduated in 1974 from Central, and I believe I stand here today because of Dan Boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:06| I'd like to read this letter that I've written to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| It was titled, My Mentor, My Friend, My Guardian Angel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| Mr. Boring ran with patience the race that was set before him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| Jesus said, If any man serve me, let him follow me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| And where I am, there also my servant be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| Mr. Boring, I want to honor Mr. Boring today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| by being ready always to give an answer to every man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| that asks me a reason of hope that is in me with meekness and fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| First of all, I have hope because of what my Father in Heaven did for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| through the work that Jesus completed on the cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Second, I have hope because God sends guardian angels to watch over us when we need them most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| As a 14-year-old, I needed a man in my life that lived what Jesus said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| It is more blessed to give than receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Mr. Boring gave me a job in the cafeteria in 1970 and 71, as well as a summer job in 1971.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| He would sign for me in detention hall and pay me to pick up trash on the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| He gave to me, He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the Lord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| and that which he hath given will he pay him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| Thank God for the givers of this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| How many hundreds and thousands have been touched by my guardian angel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| Just when you think that you are just another number in the thousands of young men and women that Mr. Boring touched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| you find out that you are special in the eyes of a great man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| I ran into Mr. Boring around 1994 at the city county building where we both worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| I said to him, Mr. Boring, I know that you won't remember me, but I want to thank you for all that you did for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| He looked at me with that patented look and said, Braden, who could forget you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| Twenty years after I had graduated, he knew who I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| I am more fortunate than most Central High School alumni in that I was able to sit down with Mr. Boring many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| from 1994 to 2006 and just talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| He reminds me of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and that he knows me personally and has touched my life personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:16| And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Right blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2836)|
| 0:47:22| Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, and their works do follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| Rest, great bobcat, for your works follow you to your resting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| Because you have touched so many, these works will multiply exponentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| Jesus said that he will reward you according to your works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| I am a living testimony of one of those works, and I am humbled to have known such a guardian angel as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2860)|
| 0:47:48| And I'm Roy Braden, class of 1974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| My mentor, my friend, and my guardian angel, Dan Boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2872)|
| 0:48:15| I know no one who has greater impact on the lives of young people in Fountain City than Dan Boring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| He had a great impact on my life and through the beginning of my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:28| But I would just like to say appreciation to the commission for recognizing a great person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2908)|
| 0:48:36| And as Roy has said, he cared for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| He had to put up with a lot of scoundrels, but he still kept his faith and kept doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Mr. Chairman, you may not realize this, but I was in the principal's office a time or two when I was a kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2932)|
| 0:48:58| And, Matt, he treated me very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| He really did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| Scared to death when I walked in, but when you walked out, like, this guy, he's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| And I also want to say a word to you, Mary, that I played basketball with Danny, as you know, through all the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:16| And there's not a finer person on that team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| And just the way you brought him up, he never got in trouble, not just because his dad was the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| but you brought both of your children up so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| So that's a compliment to you and to Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| And while I say that, don't you tell Danny that I admire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| But just what Roy has said, that sums up for a lot of students at Central High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| I mean, he was there during those golden years there at Central High School there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| And so we want to bestow this to you from county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| We have two resolutions that we want to present to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| So God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2992)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3005)|
| 0:50:16| We have one person who has signed up to speak on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| That is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Mr. Mays, if you will come to the podium or you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| Mr. Jolie would be kind enough to patch me into the big screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| I got a copy of a deposition back recently I thought you all might want to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| This is a deposition of William Thomas Salter, your solid waste director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:45| As I've told you many times before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| I allege that Mr. Salter knew that contaminated mulch had been sold to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| but continued to tell county commission that everything was okay and did not warn the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| I had evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| We confronted Mr. Salter with evidence in questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| Here is his response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Question, so in March 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| you knew that product in the sales bins at Natural Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| had extremely high levels of fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| Answer by Mr. Salter, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Question, 1,000 times higher than the limit of the EPA for fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| Answer, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| Question, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Answer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| And you had the material pulled off the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| Answer, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| How much of it was sold before it pulled off the market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3098)|
| 0:51:43| Answer, I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Question, did you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Did you inform the public that contaminated mulch had been sold to the public with fecal coliform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| Did you inform the county commission that contaminated mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| with fecal coliform had been sold to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| Answer, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| We may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| There may have been some commissioners that we told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Question, but you agreed with me earlier that you had told commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| that there was nothing wrong with the mulch, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Answer, well, after this incident, I consulted with Joel Albert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| Question, just answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| You told commissioners there was nothing wrong with the mulch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| after you had these lab tests ran in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Answer, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| Mr. Salter knew that the mulch at Natural Resources Recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| was contaminated with fecal coliform 1,000 times over the regulatory limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| but continued to tell this county commission everything was fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| and asked you to vote for a mediated settlement and forgive their debts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| By the way, Commissioner Briggs directly asked Mr. Salter if this mulch was contaminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| and he reported to him that it passed after these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| Also, this is not isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| We now know that this happened on three occasions, that the mulch was tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:15| It failed directly from the retail bins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Mr. Salter knew about it and told commission it was okay, despite the fact he knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3198)|
| 0:53:25| He also did nothing to warn the public who had purchased this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| The materials that were contaminated had exceedingly high levels of fecal coliform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| salmonella, E. coli, and molybdenum on these three various occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| which he now admits to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| Now, as a citizen, I knew this had happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| I have no choice as a citizen but to come forward and say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| To be honest with you, I would be concerned I might be charged with something if I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| It seems like I'm charged with attorney's fees for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| I was sued for slander by your solid waste director, but now he admits this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3243)|
| 0:54:10| I thought you all should know that I was telling you the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I was oftentimes portrayed, in my opinion, by Mr. VandeVeit as being dishonest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| I wonder what Mr. VandeVeit has to say now that his employee admits this took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| But more importantly, what about the constituents who voted you into those seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| whose children may have handled this, who planted food in this material?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| What about the schools this material was donated to to go into playgrounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| The simple fact of the matter is I can find no legitimate excuse for this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| to not have been told everything by one of your own officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Yes, Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| And, Brad, thank you for keeping us informed on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| And, you know, Frances, I hope that we're watching and Dean and everybody's watching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:06| because I'm real anxious to see what we're going to do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| This has been going on and going on and I know there's still litigation going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| but I'm sure something needs to be done when it's all said and done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| and everything's done legally and that's what we're waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| But I appreciate you keeping us informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| It just really aggravates me, you know, people just out and out lie to you about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| and it's not just a little white lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| We're talking public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| Well, this was a similar behavior that I discovered, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| with the Hall's green waste money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| A few other commissioners don't know how that theft was originally came public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| as me and Commissioner Smith do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| but basically an informant who had worked in the Solid Waste Office contacted me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| and told me that the Hall's green waste money was being stolen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| that the Solid Waste Director had known about it for at least six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| and had not contacted the police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| and that there was thousands of dollars being stolen from Hall's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| And I informed Commissioner Smith about this, the information I'd received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| Me and Commissioner Smith went and got six months of the receipt books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| The informant told us that this has been happening for at least six months that they knew about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| because they had discussed it with Mr. Salter six months earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| and he told them it wasn't enough money to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| There wasn't enough money stolen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| We don't need to call the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| Me and Commissioner Smith went and got the receipt books from Hall's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| and compared it to the deposit records and we found about $20,000 in cash missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| Now, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Mr. Mays, I'm going to ask you, if you would, you gave us this information at our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| so I'm going to ask you to wrap it up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| Well, we got Mr. Salter to admit that he knew that the money was being stolen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| and didn't call the police now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| I have his deposition in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Question, how long had you known about the missing money before contacting law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Answer, a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| I think we had a theft in December and I think we brought in law enforcement this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| I got the records he brought in law enforcement in June right after the incident with Rodney Rocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| Prior to the Rodney Rocket incident, none of these thefts were reported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| and Mr. Salter admits to knowing about thefts as far back as the previous December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| which would mean he knew about the thefts for six months or some of the thefts without contacting the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| Mr. Mays, you have a litigation going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| Is this correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| This is depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| This is going to be in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| This is not a court of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| I'm making you all aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| I'm asking you, sir, to wrap it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Well, I'll wrap it up, but I'm making you all aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| A lot of the things I told you all have now been admitted in depositions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| One last thing, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| You know, Dean, just for you all, you're all just being brought up to snuff on this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| It seems though in the past a lot of this just wanted to be covered up and covered up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| but we're real anxious to see, you know, once the mayor has all the facts and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| what everybody can do about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3478)|

| 0:59:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| I've invited today one of the ministers from Stock Creek Baptist Church to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| and give us a very short devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| So, Reverend Benji Fowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| Thank you so much for allowing us to be here, most definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| It doesn't matter who I am, but what does matter is I'm from south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| Born and bred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:10| Have lived here my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| Have served here my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Continue to serve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3613)|
| 1:00:14| I've been at the same church for 11 years because I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| It is wonderful to see you guys in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| I've not got to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| I had a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3623)|
| 1:00:24| And to see you guys work and move and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| And here's kind of the challenge, devotion, encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| I want you to be encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| From a south Knoxvillian, you're prayed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| You're cared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| You're loved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| You're guiding us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| You're moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| You're the ones that make us move and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| And the places that we live, you make us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| I'm listening to all the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| And the legacy that we have a chance as public servants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| because that's what we have in common as a minister or as a commission member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| or as all these people that we've acknowledged today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| It's been wonderful to hear about these people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| Legacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| So I want to challenge something I heard last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| If I had 24 hours to live, if that was it, I was gone in 24 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| How would I spend that last 24 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| How passionate am I and how much faith do I really have in what I say I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3670)|
| 1:01:15| Would I live the last 24 hours of my life serving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3675)|
| 1:01:19| Would we as public servants do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| Because that's our model of serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Because we get that from God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| I see that it takes a lot of wisdom to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| It takes a lot of wisdom and faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| And that's what we pray, that you guys have wisdom and you have faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| Because our ultimate example is God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| That's wisdom comes from above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Intelligence comes from man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| But wisdom comes from above and only from above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| So what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Well, it looks like Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| So what did Jesus Christ do in his last 24 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| Well, the Bible says that he was with his disciples and he said this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| And this is my challenge to me and to encourage you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| His last 24 hours, he was with his disciples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| and it says he had loved them to the fullest extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| and he wanted to show them in one final act of how to truly love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| And you would assume that it's the cross that he's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| And he is going to the cross ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| but how he showed them ultimate love in the last hours of his life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| was he washed their feet in humility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| And if anyone wouldn't have to do that, it would be God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| God doesn't have to wash our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| We don't deserve God to wash our feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| So what does that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| It takes ultimate humility, true servanthood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| laying down his needs and his wants and his desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| laying all that aside to love unconditionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| So I wonder in the last 24 hours of my life if I could love that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| and lay aside all that I want and all I desire to truly serve people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| So as you serve this community that I live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| my challenge is to serve in wisdom, to serve as a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| This is not just an election here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| This is not an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| This is a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| This is who you are because it's that important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| So I want to encourage you that we are praying for you guys to have wisdom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| Let me pray for us and challenge you to live that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3791)|
| 1:03:15| not because it's the last 24 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| but because that's how you truly serve people is laying yourself aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| and looking out for others' needs in front of your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Father God, we come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| and we know that we have the potential to serve and to love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| and to be on call and to be on purpose exactly the way you were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| And when we see you in action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| we see that you served and you loved unconditionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| and you served with everything that you were to the point of laying down your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| And you said that no one has a love like that except you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| and you've displayed that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| And when you left, you told us that we should love each other that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Because we think about Knox County and we think about the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| and we think about all that goes on, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| There's so many pains and sufferings and so many things going on, God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| You know them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| But we need wisdom as public servants, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| We need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| We need your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| We need your direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| We need your courage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| We need your faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| We need you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| We need love like you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| And you've told us to love each other that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| that that's how people will know you is through your love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| We thank you so much for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| I do ask for this commission to have wisdom, to have faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| to have courage to do what's right and not worry about opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| but to trust you and let your wisdom lead them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| We love you and it's in your name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3878)|

| 1:04:54| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3894)|

| 1:05:27| Are there other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3927)|

| 1:05:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Given our discussion on hillsides and the way that ended up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| I thought it would be best for us to defer this to a work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| or to our monthly session, whatever the commission desires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| to continue the discussion, the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| So that would be whatever the commission wishes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| That would be my desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| This item is going to be heard at our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Could we bring up and discuss a timetable, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| as to when we would have this workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| Because I think everyone wants to have a workshop on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| We'll talk about that during zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| Yes, I need to pull 301 off of consent, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| 301 off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| Also, I'd like to pull off of consent resolution number 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| Are there any other amendments or additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| If not, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| I guess I'd just like to make a comment on 203,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| the one recently introduced by county schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| It's not on consent, so we will be hearing it as a regular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| Today at the chairman's lunch, we had discussions of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| We have item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| Will that be moved from full commission to zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4037)|
| 1:07:20| Is that the discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| Is that the one we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| It's not numbered on these printed items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| This is out of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| The discussion of the east sector plan, rather than being in full commission today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| we'll discuss that in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| Yes, that's Commissioner Wright's desire is to discuss that during zonings today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| So if that's an acceptable commission, we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:48| I'd like to pull 404 off of consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| only for an explanation that those watching at home could hear what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:59| So that motion will be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| It will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| Commissioner Burroughs, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Where is 301?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Is that on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| No, it has been pulled off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| So it will be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| If not, Commissioner Brown, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Do I have a motion that we add what needs to be added and delete what needs to be deleted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| and deferred what needs to be deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4108)|

| 1:08:32| Clerk, drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| There are no drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| Line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| Well, I guess we can just go ahead and move on to the consent items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| because most of these are on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| We do have line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| We need to approve those separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4129)|

| 1:08:54| Line item transfers are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| We had thought of a way that we could make the consent items a bit more entertaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| We had thought about making them into a poem or perhaps a rap, but we couldn't do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4140)|
| 1:09:05| So here we are, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4145)|

| 1:14:29| Okay, there is a new ordinance that I am reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| It is still Ordinance 0-11-1-102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| An Ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| amending Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 6 of the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4482)|

| 1:15:03| And establishing Section 2-8-3-8 previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I guess I was encouraged to hear from John Duncan in the Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4516)|
| 1:15:24| I'm just wondering, I mean this is just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| I really would like to hear from the Clerk's Office, Property Assessor's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| and am I missing anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| Is that Trustee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Yeah, Ms. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| As to if they're in favor of this as written, I know I'm not touching the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| I know this is up to the executive staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| But I really would like for others to get behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| I don't see it as a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| I mean, you know, as several of us have said, we need to work for our pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4555)|
| 1:16:02| I mean, if there's a special occasion where we can actually save money by, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| in dire times by cutting staff, you know, that would be an opportunity to incentivize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| and I guess by law you have to incentivize those opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| But for us to deal with a sliver of county government and there's a lot more employees out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:28| So I guess I'll look to the law director and ask, can we, as part of this, say that we will send,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:38| since we are approving this, that we will send strongly encouraging words to the fee officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| encouraging them to embrace this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| Commissioner McKenzie, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| what you have here is essentially a change to your personnel policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| and traditionally the commission has done that through an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| In terms of your request, that would be more appropriate by way of a separate resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| simply because a lot of these separate fee offices, if you look at our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| the charter defers to state law because they're empowered by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| So an ordinance of this application would be best to stand alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| A separate resolution of the board asking the other fee offices to essentially become part of a centralized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4638)|
| 1:17:25| personnel system would be most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Mr. Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Again, I'm going to renew my objections to this that I spoke on last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:46| I really feel like we need to have as many options at our disposal as possible if we are going to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:57| we say that we want to attract the best and the brightest to government, do we or do we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| We say that often with teachers, too, that we want the best and the brightest teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| but we're not willing to have the best and the brightest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| And it looks like we're going the same way with our county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Yes, we're responsible to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| We're responsible also to the people who work for us and who are also taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| I'm also a taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| I feel like we need to not tie the hands of the Human Resources Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:37| I think Frances has mentioned her concerns about you never say never.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4717)|
| 1:18:48| You know, we need to hire the best people that we can to work for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4728)|
| 1:18:56| And contrary to popular belief, a county job doesn't pay incredibly well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4736)|
| 1:19:03| There aren't tremendous benefits with it or perks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| And to be competitive with the private sector, I think that we need to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4748)|
| 1:19:16| I'm not at all suggesting that severance should be routine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| but I think it's a tool in the Human Resources Toolbox that needs to be there in case we do need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:28| So, again, I represent the people in my district, the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:35| but I also feel like it's my responsibility to look out for the people who work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4775)|
| 1:19:41| So that's all that I have to say on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| I just had a question, and I think we brought this up at our work session last week, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| about the differences between, and we're talking about ordinance 11-1-102 now, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4791)|
| 1:19:59| As opposed to resolution R-11-1-904, which I think is just about the same thing, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:11| And it's sort of taking a compromised position in between having nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| and having a handbook change because if there are circumstances that we can't foresee right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:26| where we would want to get severance payments, where it would be in the interest of the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:32| it would be in the interest of the county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| and it would be in the interest of the people who would receive the severance pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| is that we would lose our flexibility to do that by having it in an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| because before we could do that, we would have to go through at least a two- or three-month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| before we could change the ordinance to do what needed to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| if we had some sort of economic crisis within the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Whereas the resolution 11-1-904 really says about the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| and I believe it was even with the presentation that the mayor made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| or his representatives made at our workshop meeting, the same thing would occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| but the mayor in consultation with the legislative body, which is the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| could change that with just passing a new resolution that would allow the mayor to take care of that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:25| For that reason, I'm willing to listen to other arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| but from the way I look at it, I won't vote for the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:34| but I would vote for the resolution saying the same thing because I think it gives us more flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| Mr. Jarrett, would you like to weigh in on that, the difference between the ordinance and the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| The only concern I have, commissioners, is that your personnel policy is codified in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:51| and is created by ordinance and you can't amend it via resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| So that's the process you've taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| and because the state actually requires you to file personnel policies with the clerk, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:06| that's the reason the ordinance is the vehicle by which you achieve this goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| I was wondering, I don't see him back there now, is there anyone from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:17| Dean Rice is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| I couldn't see him from where I was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Just to what the mayor's recommendation is, whether we should do this by resolution or ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4945)|
| 1:22:26| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| I found a strategic place to sit that I can be seen or not seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| No, thank you very much for the chance to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| As I mentioned last week, the mayor's goal is to have a very clear, concise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4955)|
| 1:22:41| and uniform policy that can be understood by the administration, the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| as well as those employees that are currently employees and those coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| And so in his drafting of what is in both the resolution and the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| he's trying to achieve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| There will not be severance barring a uniformly applied optional early retirement plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:08| that could be put into place if and only if the budget, number one, would allow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| and number two, that it was in a position that it would bring about real long-term savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| by removing those employment lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| That's not to say that it would be put in place at every time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| but if there was a time when this commission and the mayor faced revenue projections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| that would not meet demands, that would be an option that would be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| So in terms of asking for an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| the mayor has asked that the commission approve this by ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| simply so that it is in the code, it is part of the handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:45| The mayor has implemented this as an executive within the executive branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| It's part of the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| He's done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| But in order for the commission to be engaged fully in it, it would require it to be an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:58| If it's simply the whim of any administration, that whim can change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| And this would codify it and require a commission to be at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| in order to make adjustments to it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| If those were ever, you know, a future administration that wanted to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| it would have to come before you as a body and seek that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| This is a legal question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| If this is a resolution where they would have to come back to the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| if the resolution said the same thing as an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| then they would still have to come back to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| The only difference is it wouldn't take two months, two or three months to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5072)|
| 1:24:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Because I think resolution carries enough weight that the executive branch has to act on resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:44| passed by the legislative body, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| Well, a resolution is an express will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| An ordinance is a law of countywide effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Your code, Article 10, Section 10, is the personnel plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| and all of the actions of the county personnel plan are codified in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| So this amends that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| And the only way to amend an ordinance is through an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:09| I understand the expedience issue, but, again, the problem is you've already codified your personnel plan in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:17| And as a result, that's the only way it could be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| Now, as you're aware, there is a provision within the charter for emergency ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| So in the event of some catastrophe, the mayor could request an emergency ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| and that waives the reading requirements and would give you an expedited ordinance that we could draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| So you have that fail-safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| But I certainly understand logically you would presume that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| but because of the manner in which you've done it in the past, if you deviate from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| a resolution would not essentially amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| Well, thank you for your explanation, and thank you for yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| I thought last week that we determined that we would contact the other, the fee officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| the elected officers about coming under the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| It was brought up earlier, you know, why we do one without the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Of course, we can't do anything with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| That's just to be on a voluntary basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| But have we contacted all of them yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| I have not contacted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Well, I think we had to pass through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| What the law director was saying is that within the resolution might be the place for us to add some language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5183)|
| 1:26:29| that we need to contact the other fee officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:32| And once that comes up, 904, I think it is, gets passed, then we'll be in a position to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| I hate to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| Ms. Witt, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Would you mind, I mean, I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| Would you like to address this as far as your office is concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| Glad to, Commissioner Sherry Witt, 5052 Dubwood Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5211)|
| 1:26:56| As far as I cannot speak for all of the fee offices, but I can say for my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| and I have been an employee in that office for some 20-something years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| and we've just never come across some of the things that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| And it's just one of those things that we have our own personnel plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| We adhere to the county plan in most, in almost everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| but we do have some personal things in our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| And that's what's worked all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| We've never, I cannot imagine how thick the handbook might be if we have to say don't, don't, don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| on things that are obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| So that's where we stand as far as what the mayor is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| I understand that, and I respect him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| And if there is a problem, then maybe that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| But, you know, it is, again, as the law director said, up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:50| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| I think that this is what we're talking about, and Dean had said uniform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| and that's exactly what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| This is not uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| This only affects a certain percentage of county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| I don't think it's right to treat some employees different from others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| There are a lot of reasons that I object to this, but that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| And, you know, if we want to, if we don't want the best working for our taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5298)|
| 1:28:28| and working in government, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| But we need to be honest with ourselves about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| So I don't agree with this for a lot of reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| but one of the big ones is that it's not applied uniformly to every county employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| and that's just simply not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Oh, Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| Dr. Briggs, are you satisfied with the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| Yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| I agree with what you said about the lack of a little bit of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| Yeah, you know, I agree with that, and I think the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| and I have read the county charter multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| especially in the last couple of years with everything that's occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| And I do recall now, just as the law director, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| very astutely pointed out that we do have the ability to pass emergency ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| if some catastrophe occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| And I'm really satisfied with the explanation that Dean Rice gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| and, you know, particularly after the clarification with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| And just one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| I guess if we pass this, we won't need 904, then, will we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| No, essentially we would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Also, this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| It does come back for a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5391)|
| 1:29:56| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| approving the lease agreement between the station LPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| and the Knox County Board of Education for the lease of property known as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| Ellington Station and Depot located at 800 and 806 World's Fair Park Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| respectively, for the purpose of housing the new STEM Academy High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| This is resolution 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| This item is added by the schools today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Motion to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| Mr. Dillingham, are you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| Doug Dillingham is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:49| Doug Dillingham, Knox County Schools Facilities and Construction Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:53| 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Thanks for coming, Mr. Dillingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| I hate getting handed a contract that's worth $8.5 million over 20 years 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| minutes before we vote on it, but that's what happened to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| A couple of questions about the contract and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| We're going to be paying $425,000 a year for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| That's what the school system is paying to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| And I wouldn't ask you these questions in public, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| it's brought before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| You're the only one I can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| The owner of the property says his property taxes can't go up for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| Is that what the contract calls for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| I'm sorry, Commissioner, I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| Let's go back to the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| I guess the maintenance question I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| We're renting a building at $420,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| and we're responsible for the roof and everything else, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| It's actually a lease purchase agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| so it will become the property of Knox County Schools at the end of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| In 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| Is that common with, if you're going to take ownership, is that common?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| Or most landlord tenants, I thought the landlord took care of the exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| Well, generally speaking, it's been my experience that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| the landlord is basically responsible for it, but generally tenants pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| which is a fee that they pay on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| Now, I would like to point out as well that the contract is for $425,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| but there is a grant agreement that the City of Knox will be given to the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| that is equal to $200,000 a year that will go toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| But we're still putting $425,000 a year of taxpayer dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| whether it be from the city and the county, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| And, Commissioner Enders, let me add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| If the building burns down, we still continue to pay that every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| until the term of the contract is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5576)|
| 1:33:04| What's the motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| I'd like to make a substitute motion to defer until February to review this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| The motion has been made and seconded to defer until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| Has anyone, have we had any sort of appraisal done on the property on how much the property is actually worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5598)|
| 1:33:28| Knox County Schools has not had an appraisal done on it, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| You know, because I think it's about eight, I added this up and you may have brought it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| it's about eight and a half million dollars we're going to be paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| And we do get back over that period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| if my math is correct, about $420,000 in taxes over that 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:50| But, you know, I don't know if we did an analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| If we're going to be responsible for the building, the maintenance, the roof, and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| would it be better off just to buy the thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| You know, it might entail taking on more debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| and this is something we would need to look at with the schools and the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| and have some deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5647)|
| 1:34:09| I'm not saying whether this is the right or the wrong thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| We do lose a little bit in taxes if we purchase the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| but I don't know how much the building is worth and if it's been for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| I think I've seen for sale signs out there maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| But that's just something I think that might be worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I don't know if that was even discussed at the school board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| or not when the school board approved this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| I know everyone wants to keep county debt down now by, you know, by leasing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| and that sometimes is good and sometimes might not be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| but I just wonder how much the building is worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| My concern is, you know, we're handed a contract 30, you know, an hour before our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| and I understand this is not a consent item, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| I mean, this is not an educational consent item where we have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5689)|
| 1:34:57| Generally, I mean, they are normally put on educational consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| because the agreement you have with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| unless you feel there's something illegal about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| or in the alternative there's no funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| then it normally goes through your consent agenda and is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Was that the intent of the school board on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| I believe that it was, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| Mr. Oaks is shaking his head yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| Well, we should have him up here at the podium then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Mr. Oaks, if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| Do I still have the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| I'll give it back to you if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5735)|
| 1:35:37| Dr. Briggs, is that all right with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Mr. Oaks, what was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| So your all's intent was this to be on the consent agenda for educational consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| It's my understanding that that was the intent of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| And the reason this didn't make consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| or it's my understanding that the reason this didn't make consent agenda is we were late getting it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| and providing it to commission, so it had to be added after the agenda was set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| And what was the vote on this building, on this lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| What was the vote of the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I mean, this is a lot of responsibility for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| I can't understand that we didn't have enough to build enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| And I'm for the STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| By all means, I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| But, you know, when I first got the phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| and they said we're going to build a STEM Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| we're just going to kind of approach you about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| and they said it's going to cost $3 million to bring it up to standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| and we have $2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| And then, or no, it's going to cost $4 million, and we have $3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| Now it's costing $4 million, and we only have $2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| So there's been a lot of change in the funding, the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| But I just, what was the vote of the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| That was a board meeting that I missed, so I don't remember specifically, but I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| It was unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| Because I've attended all the school board meetings, work sessions, and meetings since October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5819)|
| 1:37:06| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| No, I'm sorry, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| One question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Is this, is the, or do they have the intent to have an educational consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| And do we have to put it on educational consent, or can we defer it for 30 days or to February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| Well, the only reason you would, again, first we want to make sure that there's nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| a deferral would not cause hardship to the school board or we'd incur any additional penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| But your agreement with the school board is unless you can demonstrate that this is unfunded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| or in the alternative it's an illegal contract, it should have been on educational consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| and it should have been passed by the commission by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| And that's as a result of the agreement with the school board, the negotiated settlement with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| But you also have the school superintendent here as well now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| Dr. McIntyre, is this in the current capital budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| Or the current school budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| Commissioner, we have Jim McIntyre, superintendent of schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| We have identified the funding within our budget to, within the current fiscal year in order to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:16| Obviously we'll have to make a commitment to it over the long term in order to fund the out years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| But, yeah, we intend to certainly, the board has had a great amount of discussion about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| and we feel this is an important part of our future and an important part of our strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| and we're prepared to ensure that we have the funding to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| Well, I guess based on the legality of it being funded through the current budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| I had to pull my motion for 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| I'm disappointed in the contract, but I don't know that with that court agreement, I don't know that we can win that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:54| So I'm pulling my substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| So there's a second wish to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| Explain why he has to, why we can't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| Because for it not to be on educational consent, it has to be either illegal or it has to be unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5942)|
| 1:39:08| It's neither of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| It's just a bad lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| So if we wanted to vote against it, it doesn't matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| Is that what you're saying, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Unless it meets the criteria, this should, normally this, if the timing was different, we had more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| it would have been on your standard educational consent calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| and would not be pulled unless it was illegal or unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| And Dr. McIntyre has asserted that there is funding and it is a legal contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5973)|
| 1:39:42| Dr. McIntyre, I'm not happy with this one bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| I think this is, I mean, as he said, it's $8.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| We could have built an elementary school for $8.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| And the way that this whole thing seems to be on fast track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| I wish that you all could have got a hold of us and talked to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| but you all act like we've got all the money in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:06| And the taxpayers can just fund you whatever they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| It puts us in a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Point of order, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| I don't know who has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| Have you acknowledged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6017)|
| 1:40:18| No, I have not, but I was giving him a little leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| You're asking for the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| I'm the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| I'd ask him if he was going to withdraw his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| You know, I like construction projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| I like things like this, but I just, as a citizen, as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| I just don't appreciate how this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| We continually question us not being able to pick and choose the education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6048)|
| 1:40:57| the department, the school board's actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6057)|
| 1:41:01| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| But we continually try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I don't think that substitute motion was valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| so the second shouldn't even have to comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| It was not a valid motion because we cannot, by agreed order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| mess in the school board's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| We can get mad all we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| We can complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| But at the end of the day, this passed 9-0 by the same people that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:37| So, you know, we've dealt a lot with issues, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| that we don't really have any power to vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| But for county taxpayers, this facility is costing us roughly $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:55| Now, we love to pull in the city when it's convenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Yeah, city residents are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| But we kind of pull in where the city is paying $4 million as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| At the end of the day, we're getting a high school, a STEM academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| for $4 million of taxpayer money over a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| If Austin-East Powell, Carnes had a roof problem, we're going to take care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| just like this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| Those buildings cost more than $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| And in today's money, they cost a bunch more than $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| So we're getting a facility that's going to house our students from all over this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6155)|
| 1:42:42| for a $4 million county taxpayer tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| I say congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| They have people that deal with their contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| We have to trust that their contract, their track record is pretty darn good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6174)|
| 1:43:01| There hadn't been a lot of lawsuits as a result of improper contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| So we have to assume while we did get this at the last minute, as a courtesy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| that it's a good contract, that it's a valid contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| If it's not, we'll, you know, we have the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| But to try to delay this additionally, additional months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| is bordering on the end of not being able to start school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| They have plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| Their plans are in place to start this school in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| We can't continually delay this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| I'm extremely excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| This is going to be a boom for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| When I look at Hume, Fogg, Martin Luther King Academy in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| those are extremely, when you look at the top of the statewide schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| they're always up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| These are downtown schools, schools in impoverished neighborhoods that are succeeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| that are drawing, that are true magnets, that are drawing from all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| They have waiting lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| People are getting excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| And your constituents from Districts 1 through 9 are going to get excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6248)|
| 1:44:14| You know, people ask me, how can you be for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6254)|
| 1:44:16| It's going to adversely affect the makeup of the top level of your class at Austin East, in my case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6256)|
| 1:44:24| It may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| But we're going to give some kids a unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| They're going to have some extremely challenging subjects and subject matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:35| And they're going to be able to interact with kids from all different walks, from rural to urban to rich to poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| to get together, solve problems, learn collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| I'm excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| And again, for the details of it, I think we need to, I'll say it again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6287)|
| 1:44:53| stay in our lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| We have a tendency to want to dabble in school board business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| I don't think it's going to work out well for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| I guess my original thoughts or questions have been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| Educational consent sort of takes it off the table, whether we like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| But I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| I mean, I like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| I regret we got the contract so late, but I like what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| I was scared here a few weeks ago when it was price tag went from four to five to eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| That scared me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| I think Greater Schools Partnership had to get involved in there, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| And I appreciate their buzz, Thomas and those guys stepping up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| The city's commitment, $200,000 for 20 years, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| Yes, Commissioner, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| So that's for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| And if I'm doing my math right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| I would think if this were going in Halls or Powell or Carnes or Hardin Valley or South Knoxville or Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| the city wouldn't be put a penny in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| So I think that's a pretty good deal for the Knotts County school system and the Knotts County taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| that the city is willing to step up and put that, which they certainly don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| They're pretty good partners in education anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| Give us more of that sales tax than they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| So I'm very proud the city is going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| And to me it's like this midway a few weeks, I'm sort of an anti-sprawl person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| I'd rather see it downtown in an existing building and create more economic activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:31| just more people bring them downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| On a personal basis, I went to a downtown school and it was exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| I went to movies and did things after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| We had football teams too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| I don't guess this one's going to have one initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| But I think that's a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| And another personal basis, I worked in this building about 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| and never thought of it as a school, but I think it would be a great school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6409)|
| 1:46:55| And my only regret is that we didn't get the contract a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| But I think it will be a great project and I'm glad that hopefully it will move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| and I can support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Just to say I appreciate that and I apologize for the timing of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| That is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| But also I want to make sure the Commission understands that we're also trying to be very cost effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| and really use the resources of the taxpayers very wisely in this investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| In fact, that's part of why we really pushed off this decision for another month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| to really step back and to make sure that the L&N Station building and campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| was really the best option for our school district and for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| And as Mr. Shouse has noted, there's an investment on the part of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| There's a commitment on the part of the Great Schools Partnership to raise some private funds to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| We're pursuing historic preservation tax credits that would be available at the L&N Station building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6470)|
| 1:47:56| and would not be available at any of the other options that we've potentially looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6476)|
| 1:48:00| And so in addition to that, there's about $2 million available from the Race to the Top funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:06| to support this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| So in terms of the investment that we're making on the part of Knox County Schools resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| there's also a great investment on the part of other outside entities, state entities, and others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6492)|
| 1:48:19| to really support what I think is going to be a very high quality education in the STEM disciplines for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| and an important part of our achieving our really ambitious agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| and our strategic plan of excellence for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| Let me echo everyone else's concerns about the fact that we're just receiving this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| I had not really prepared anything to say for or against the proposal because I didn't know it would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:50| In fact, I asked several times over the last week the status of this particular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| As I stated earlier, I've attended all the school board meetings since October, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6537)|
| 1:49:05| This particular one elicited a lot of conversation among those members of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6545)|
| 1:49:13| Before I get into some of their comments, let me say something about the partnership that the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6553)|
| 1:49:22| and the county commission has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| It's true they're involved in the education of students in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| the capital funds associated with pursuing that endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| But to say that we can't sit here and discuss it in commission when we have to come up with the dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:41| from the citizens of Knox County, I do not agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| We have a perfect right to discuss where money comes from and where money goes here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6587)|
| 1:49:55| Something that Commissioner McKenzie pointed to just a second ago was about the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6595)|
| 1:50:03| that are going to attend this academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| It has nothing to do whether they're smart, they're impoverished, they're from the county, or they're from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| It's each existing high school right now, based on the percentage of their head count in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:22| will have that many seats lotteried to them and the interested parents, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:30| at Gibbs High School or Carter High School, will have the opportunity to enter their child's name in a lottery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6630)|
| 1:50:39| in that school to fill those seats as freshmen or sophomore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| It's a true cross-section of the student body of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| It does not look at anything else the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| So to say that this will be a smart school, that may not be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| It's going to be a true representative cross-section of Knox County, but of parents that are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6664)|
| 1:51:15| So I guess what that then brings me to think is that if you have interested parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| that are focused on their child's progress and development, you'll have a better student body at the STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6680)|
| 1:51:29| But then I look back at the schools identified in Knox County that are having trouble meeting their standards right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| so we're skimming the interested, focused kids off of those high schools and then moving them to the STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6695)|
| 1:51:44| Now, Gibbs has just been identified as a student population where if there's a parental request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6704)|
| 1:51:53| and a parent provides transportation, they can leave Gibbs High School and go to another school of their choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6713)|
| 1:52:01| if they're accepted and if it's a school that's accepting transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6721)|
| 1:52:08| I'm not saying the STEM is bad, but I think the process by which we're getting there has some flaws in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:17| While I'm at Gibbs High School, a part of the funding for this particular program at the L&N pushes off roof repair at Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6737)|
| 1:52:26| To say it's not costing other existing schools in Knox County something, and that's just the one thing I remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6746)|
| 1:52:35| there are other funded programs giving up a little bit here and a little bit there to come up with the up-front money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6755)|
| 1:52:43| to get this L&N building renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6763)|
| 1:52:49| I believe that I also heard somewhere in this that all of the buildings not being renovated in this particular go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| There may be other renovations expenses yet to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| it being that there are only going to be freshmen and sophomores there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| The school is going to have to grow out to juniors and seniors also being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| For me, the funding body, we look at the difference between students sitting in their current existing high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:25| and then going and adding whatever these millions of dollars are to get them into a downtown location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:37| There's an expense to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| Is that $1,000 a child additional from them being at Austin East or Gibbs or Carter or Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6822)|
| 1:53:50| There will be Farragut kids there too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6830)|
| 1:53:54| We're offering standard, normal, good education for all kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6834)|
| 1:54:01| Well, to get them out of their current high school and get them into a STEM school, it's going to have a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:12| I think we were doing pretty good where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| If this were something we would vote on, because of the reasons that I've identified, I would vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6858)|
| 1:54:28| I believe we just not had the time enough to look and hear and listen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6868)|
| 1:54:36| and I believe that the school board found itself in that same position when this proposal was presented to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6883)|
| 1:54:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Mr. Lindsey, before you got here, we did something over at Austin East, and we had the magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6886)|
| 1:54:55| How is this different from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| I know that's underutilized over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Could we not have put that over at that place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| The concept that we're talking about is in our five-year strategic plan that the board approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| and we've talked about for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| The idea is for a high-quality, stand-alone magnet STEM academy high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| and that would be really our first magnet school that is a pure magnet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| that does not have its own geographic base but that draws students from all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| Well, why does it have to be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| I mean, Austin East, where we did the magnet school there, it's underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| Why does it have to be separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Well, again, I think the idea is that there is a cadre of students for whom this will be an area of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:44| and an area where they can get a great education in the STEM disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| I think it leverages lots of partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| The University of Tennessee is a part of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a part of this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| Oak Ridge Associated Universities are a part of this effort, and the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| There's about $2 million in Race to the Top resources that are going toward this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6962)|
| 1:56:07| and those resources are specifically allocated for a STEM academy high school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6967)|
| 1:56:15| Well, you know, UT will come to Austin East, and so will the other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6975)|
| 1:56:20| Oak Ridge, they'll come over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| How many millions did we spend on Austin East to get it renovated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| Well, Austin East, their magnet component, there's a couple different magnet components to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| but the one that was a large focus of the facility was performing arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6992)|
| 1:56:37| so there's lots of dance studios and auditorium and a performing arts auditorium and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| So the focus on the facility at Austin East was really around the performing arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| And how many students will this, do you anticipate, about 200 per class, about 800 kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| About 800, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I guess me, like the rest of them that have spoken so far, are kind of upset that we haven't had time to look this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7023)|
| 1:57:12| But reading through it while the talking has been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| one thing that stands out to me on page 7, 12.6, under Miscellaneous, is time is of the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| And I think this is probably one of the reasons why that this is before us today rather than next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7042)|
| 1:57:29| because if they're going to get it ready for school in August, they've got to get started on it yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| So, you know, this is one of the things I think you have to, we don't exactly live in a totally black or totally white world today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:43| Sometimes you've got to have some gray area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| and I think this may be one of those where we, you know, need to say, okay, looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7065)|
| 1:57:54| Just so Commission knows, we had a, you all had approved a policy that anything that went past the deadline would need to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| and ask the Chair to be put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7080)|
| 1:58:02| I believe Mr. Oaks called me on Friday and said it was necessary to get this on the agenda for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| I agreed to put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| And so that's the process that we went through to get it on here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| Ms. Broas, did you want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| Yes, I just wanted to mention that we have a magnet honors academy for the elementary schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7095)|
| 1:58:24| but there is no honors middle school or honors high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| which is a problem, in my opinion, for the kids who come out of the honors elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| A lot of them are going into private education because they come out ahead of other sixth graders going into middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7115)|
| 1:58:46| So this doesn't solve the problem of the honors middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| and I hope that that's something that the school board will tackle really soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| But I'm glad that this is in place for the kids who are on that honors track starting in kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7135)|
| 1:59:04| I think it will be a good thing, and I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| And the school board has my complete support in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| Commissioner Broyles, what you just spoke to, though, is not being solved by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7157)|
| 1:59:22| This is not an honors high school where you get in on your tract or your merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7162)|
| 1:59:28| or your position coming from elementary school or middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| This is entirely by lottery of all the high schools, rising juniors and seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7172)|
| 1:59:39| rising freshmen and sophomore students in Knox County today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| Anyone that applies will be pulled from a hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| It has nothing to do with being an honors school for honors kids that are in one through five right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7190)|
| 1:59:58| I guess my feeling on that is that it takes the parent to get the process started for a child to even get into the lottery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7198)|
| 2:00:09| And if a parent has a high-achieving child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| they're going to recognize the opportunities that are going to be available at this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| and will be anxious to have their child take part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7218)|
| 2:00:23| So, no, there may not be a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| Is there a testing to get in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| I know at the elementary school there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| But if there's not testing to get in, if it's strictly by lottery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| still the high-achieving students whose parents are engaged in their education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7234)|
| 2:00:40| and want them to have the advantage of the STEM high school will make sure that their kids are on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7240)|
| 2:00:48| So, no, it may not be strictly a continuation of the honors track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7248)|
| 2:00:54| but I think it makes something available for parents of high-achieving students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| to send their kids someplace different than just the regular Knox County high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7259)|
| 2:01:04| Not that there's anything wrong with the regular Knox County high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| There's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| I am zoned for Fulton, and I think Fulton is doing an exceptional job educating our community's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7268)|
| 2:01:15| They're amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| But this gives students another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| And for parents who are engaged in their children's education and want this for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7282)|
| 2:01:27| it's there and it's available, and I think that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| And I would respond by saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7291)|
| 2:01:33| I don't know that we need this greater opportunity at more than $1,000 a head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7293)|
| 2:01:38| for these kids to get something there which they can get at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7298)|
| 2:01:42| I agree with you about Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7302)|
| 2:01:45| And I would also offer to you that 100 percent of the population of Gibbs High School parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7305)|
| 2:01:51| because they may want to get away from Gibbs because of its new category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7311)|
| 2:01:56| if 100 percent of them put their kid's name in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| then it doesn't matter about being high-performing or achieving kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| Everyone that is there, back to your original point, this is not an honors school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| It's just another average school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| Dean, can you come to the podium real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| You know, Dean, as you're coming to the podium, I know the mayor is trying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| one of the big things that you're all trying to do is cut and get our debt down and where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| And it seems like, you know, every time we do something, we may be spinning our wheels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| and this just puts you back another $425,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7355)|
| 2:02:41| You know, $8.5 million total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| Has the mayor weighed in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| How big a buy-in does this put you guys in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| Well, we've not seen the final numbers on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| but it's my understanding that a good portion of this funding for the school overall will come from a federal grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7370)|
| 2:02:56| and then another portion is being raised privately through the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7376)|
| 2:03:00| Now, the actual burden that comes down to the tax dollars at the county level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| I've not talked with the superintendent in terms of their budget of where it's going to come from within their budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| would be above and beyond, and that certainly would be something to be addressed in this coming budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:14| But I can't speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| I haven't seen the documents, and I don't know the details of what you have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| And speaking about the federal dollars, is it going to be funded one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| Dr. McIntyre, can you explain how much of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| Yeah, it's a $2 million grant over two years, this year and next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7408)|
| 2:03:32| And I guess, Commissioner, the way I look at this is as an investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7412)|
| 2:03:39| We have a budget that's appropriated by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7419)|
| 2:03:44| and the school board looks to use those dollars as wisely and efficiently as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| to get the best outcomes for our students that we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7429)|
| 2:03:53| And we believe that this investment is a good one for the future of our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7433)|
| 2:03:57| that having a rigorous, high-quality STEM magnet high school in Knox County is a good thing for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7437)|
| 2:04:06| A high-quality STEM education does, for our kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7446)|
| 2:04:08| really create some habits of learning and cognition and thinking for our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| that are going to put them in good stead no matter what they're going to do in their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7453)|
| 2:04:16| And we think this is a great opportunity for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| And I think part of the reason that we're really interested in this opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| is because of the wonderful regional assets that we have in the STEM disciplines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| that we have the premier laboratory in the nation in our midst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| that we have the flagship university for the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| research university for the state of Tennessee, right here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| that we have some great technology companies and engineering companies in our midst| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| that we can benefit from, and if we leverage all those partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7486)|
| 2:04:49| which we fully intend to do, we think this can be an outstanding opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| for 800 students in this area that can really provide a terrific education for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7493)|
| 2:05:01| And I think the other concept that's important to note here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| is that there's this notion in the Race to the Top strategy for the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| also, of a STEM hub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| And a STEM hub is not just a school, but a partnership among entities in a region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| that will really take a leadership role in STEM education for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| And, you know, that the university will be a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| that the laboratory will be a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| that Knox County schools will be a part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| and there's additional funding for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7529)|
| 2:05:31| But this is really about opportunities for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| And as you know, you know, having a high-quality STEM education is great for our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| in terms of their learning and their habits of thinking for the future and problem-solving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| but it's also great for their possibilities in terms of career opportunities for the future as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7542)|
| 2:05:47| So we think it's a great investment of the resources that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| and we're trying to cobble together the various funding sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| to ensure that as the taxpayers invest in this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| that there are lots of other entities that are supporting it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| One last thing, Mr. Chairman, is just, you know, we had a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| I would have liked to have talked like other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7565)|
| 2:06:07| and I know we had stuff, we had a workshop today at lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| but for something this important and this amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| I would have come another 34 or 35 minutes and been there if we'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| hey, let's be there at 10, 30, 11 o'clock, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| we've got something major that we need to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| I think our hearts are in the right place as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7582)|
| 2:06:24| but we want to be well informed in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| So, you know, we want to make educated votes, bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7597)|
| 2:06:38| I did have a couple of questions also, and I agree totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7598)|
| 2:06:42| In my previous life, I always wondered why we didn't have a greater connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7602)|
| 2:06:47| to the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Labs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7607)|
| 2:06:50| It was just, you know, there were some minor attempts, I guess, at best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7610)|
| 2:06:55| but there was always, it was like the types of assets that were available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7615)|
| 2:07:02| I mean, we just didn't use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7622)|
| 2:07:03| So this is a, you know, I can see this as being potentially a very good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7623)|
| 2:07:08| and I haven't really studied the issue so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7628)|
| 2:07:15| It's gotten a lot of press, and of course here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| I suppose that, you know, some of the things that I read about in the paper were that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7639)|
| 2:07:24| although the Board of Education had a unanimous vote on it, there was a lot of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| and I was wondering if I could ask you a question or two about the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| I guess especially as, like, being a building-level guy like I was, I was always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| when you're in the school and you're in the classroom, you're kind of worried about you getting less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7658)|
| 2:07:43| if somebody else is getting some, if you know what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| I mean, there's a sexy amount of dollars to go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| So in terms of your budget and your commitment to each of those individual high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| they're going to have a few students taken away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| I mean, how are you assuring your teachers there that, hey, we're not taking away from you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| You're still going to have your programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| You're still going to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| You're going to have excellence in your schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7686)|
| 2:08:08| What are you saying to those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Well, you know, I think part of the funding strategy is that some dollars will follow the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7690)|
| 2:08:15| As students come from other high schools to this high school at the L&N Station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7695)|
| 2:08:21| the STEM Academy High School, that some of those dollars will follow those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| But I guess what I'm saying to folks, and I'm going out to Farragut High School in a couple days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| to talk to the faculty out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7709)|
| 2:08:31| I know there's some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| But we've got some great STEM programs in some of our schools already, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| at Farragut High School, at Hardin Valley Academy, at Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| We've got some great STEM-related programs already going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| And this is not intended to take away from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| It's not intended to limit the opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:49| It's really intended to enhance everything that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| So, for example, you know, we just got this wonderful grant from UT Battelle that was announced on Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| for distance education, for distance learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| And what that is is they're going to equip us with the technology to be able to provide video conferencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| and provide instruction to a lot of our kids in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| So you might have an advanced physics course that's taught at the STEM Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| that we're going to be able to have students in, you know, all of our other 13 high schools take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| So we're really looking to make sure that it doesn't limit opportunities for kids, that it really enhances them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| And this notion of the STEM hub is exactly supposed to be meant to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| It's meant to, you know, ensure collaboration, ensure synergies among some of the businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7768)|
| 2:09:35| and institutions and universities and school districts in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| to ensure that we're all working together to make sure that our kids can get a great education in the STEM disciplines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| And I was talking to a group of scientists the other day, and I said, you know, when it comes to STEM education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| we think we can have more mass and more energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7789)|
| 2:09:51| We think we can break the laws of physics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| And I think it can be more than the sum of its parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| And then my other question, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| That's, I'm sure, helpful to the people that are in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| and are worried about their programs and their funding levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| And you mentioned the federal funds and the two million raised to the top funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| Was that tied down to this project per se, like you're not getting it unless you build it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7812)|
| 2:10:19| It is specifically earmarked, and I know earmarked is kind of a dirty word these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:24| It's specifically allocated for a STEM high school or a STEM school in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7824)|
| 2:10:30| And if we don't use it for that, it will not get used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| No other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7838)|
| 2:10:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| Who withdrew his?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Did you withdraw your second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| He's going to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7853)|
| 2:10:54| So the motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7854)|
| 2:10:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7855)|
| 2:10:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| Commissioner Wright passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7860)|
| 2:11:01| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7861)|
| 2:11:02| Five-minute recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7862)|
| 2:11:03| We'll gather together here about 340.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110124part1?start=7863)|
