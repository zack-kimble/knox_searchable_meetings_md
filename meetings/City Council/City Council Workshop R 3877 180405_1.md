| 2:32:33| Do you also help them get signed up for TennCare if they're not on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| And just to clarify for anyone that might be watching outside of this audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9157)|
| 2:32:42| if they have arrests or records of arrests, I know that makes them ineligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9162)|
| 2:32:48| or they could get kicked off their TennCare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| And how does that impact your SSDI?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| I think you might be referring, I think, I'm not sure that I'm an expert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9174)|
| 2:32:57| are you thinking about if they go to jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Okay, so if an individual goes to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9180)|
| 2:33:02| Incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| If an individual gets incarcerated, then they halt those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9183)|
| 2:33:10| And so by the time they come out of jail, oftentimes that process has to get reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9190)|
| 2:33:17| And what we know about individuals who have a mental illness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9197)|
| 2:33:19| they typically stay three times longer in jail than their counterpart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9199)|
| 2:33:25| So it's really challenging for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| I think there's been some effort to make that happen to where they don't lose their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| I'm not sure that that's happening at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Is it the same with SSDI as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| Is it the same with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| Yes, a lot of times the way that TennCare actually works is you're getting TennCare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9224)|
| 2:33:49| in conjunction with getting approved for your benefits through Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9229)|
| 2:33:53| So when one is cut off, the other one is cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9233)|
| 2:33:55| So what's really happened when they're in jail is their Social Security benefits got put on hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| so their TennCare that's connected to that is also put on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9239)|
| 2:34:04| And I would say it takes a good couple months once you've gotten out of jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9244)|
| 2:34:07| to get through all of the paperwork and the red tape in order to get that reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9247)|
| 2:34:12| Okay, to get your meds back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Any other questions, counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| Leigh Ann and Michael, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9259)|
| 2:34:21| This has been a fire hose tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| Michael, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9269)|
| 2:34:32| I just want to thank everybody who spoke tonight and everybody who's here and part of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9272)|
| 2:34:39| There could have easily been more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9279)|
| 2:34:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| And it's an honor to me to work with these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| because they do an incredible amount of really important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| Even when it's discouraging, they show up and they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| And I want to thank you guys for the opportunity to talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9295)|
| 2:34:59| I will add my thanks as well to those who have persisted this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9299)|
| 2:35:03| We have gotten a barrel full of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9303)|
| 2:35:07| And as you indicated, there is a lot more out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| So we've seen part of the iceberg, not the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9311)|
| 2:35:16| And I really, really appreciate everybody's effort tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9316)|
| 2:35:19| I appreciate my colleagues that persisted with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9319)|
| 2:35:23| And I hope that we will now involve ourselves a little more in the Mayor's Roundtable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9323)|
| 2:35:31| and in the Homeless Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| I think that's where we can pick up and maintain a pretty high level of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9332)|
| 2:35:38| about our homeless situation and the efforts toward solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9338)|
| 2:35:44| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9344)|
| 2:35:45| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| There is nobody signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| So if there are no other questions, we will adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9349)|
| 2:35:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncilWorkshopR3877180405?start=9354)|
