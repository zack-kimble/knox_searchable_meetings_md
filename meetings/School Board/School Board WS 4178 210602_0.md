| 0:01:31| Good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=91)|
| 0:01:34| We have Law Director David Buch in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| Thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| I don't think we have any other elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=99)|
| 0:01:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Welcome to our Knox County Board of Education June 2nd work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=103)|
| 0:01:48| We appreciate your patience with moving this meeting to 3 o'clock today so that board members and the superintendent may attend the Hardin Valley graduation ceremony this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=108)|
| 0:02:03| So, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| I'm going to ask board members for some flexibility today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| I was planning to ask for item 11 A and B to move or the last two items on our agenda to move to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=130)|
| 0:02:19| But because Ms. Satterfield is running a little late, I don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| And Mr. McMillan is running a little late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=143)|
| 0:02:25| So, what I would like to ask the board to do is to, when it's time for us to start the agenda, if we can just go ahead and start working through the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=145)|
| 0:02:35| And then maybe as we get to the end of consent, maybe Ms. Satterfield will be here by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| And then we can jump to our regular agenda item, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| That's what I'd like to propose that we just have a little bit of flexibility today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| Also, I would like to extend a very special welcome to our 2021-22 board student representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=171)|
| 0:03:01| And this is Mr. Raymond Ginn of Fairgate High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| Thank you for being here today and congratulations to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=184)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| We will be officially recognizing Mr. Ginn at our June 30th work session as his term begins on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=192)|
| 0:03:21| But he is with us this afternoon and he was planning to sit with Ms. Lee, who's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=201)|
| 0:03:26| So, moving to 3 o'clock has challenges, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| So, he was going to learn the ropes from Ms. Lee, but she's not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| But we're glad you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| And this is Abigail's final month with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| So, we will be recognizing her next month at our regular board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| And so, we're excited to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| And so, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| So, as I noted, Ms. Satterfield and Mr. McMillan are expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| Ms. Bounds is not able to join us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=235)|
| 0:03:58| Another issue that we're having is with our live streaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| It is not working right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| So, I'm told that we are recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| And so, the full meeting will be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| Correct, Ms. Harrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| The full meeting will be posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| And hopefully, we can get up and running soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| But just so that everyone's aware, we're having that technical difficulty also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| So, we'll just hopefully get that fixed soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| So, with all of that, do we have any changes to this work session agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Can you click that light so it's not on, Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| And you may have a ‑‑ just push that little button right there on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=286)|

| 0:04:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| So, if we have no changes to the agenda, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| A motion with flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=298)|

| 0:05:01| So, we have a motion by Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=301)|

| 0:05:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=317)|
| 0:05:18| As we attend commencement ceremonies this week, it is certainly an appropriate time to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=318)|
| 0:05:23| our vision of growing lifelong learners who contribute their achievements ‑‑ I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| who contribute their talents, strengths, and skills to build a stronger community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| As our Knox County students celebrate their achievements, we will hear encouraging speeches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| given ‑‑ that give us hope as the class of 2021 concludes during this very challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| The lessons they learn from their experiences will make our community stronger as they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| rewarded for their skill and success as they transition to higher education through college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| or careers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| And I know I speak for all of the members of the board when I wish the class of 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| nothing but the best as they journey into the next phase of life, and we look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| to seeing and celebrating those accomplishments from our ‑‑ from the students of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| class of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| So, with that, I'd like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for his report this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| A few brief updates since we last met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| As you know, the school year ended last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| I do want to take one more opportunity to say thank you to all of our students, families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| and employees for their extraordinary efforts during this past school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| However, I think it's also important to point out that KCS still has many things happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| actually this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| First of all, our elementary and middle summer learning camps began yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| I'm very excited about this opportunity for eligible students to continue their learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| this summer, and I am grateful for all the KCS employees who are working hard to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| these camps a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| I want to remind drivers that because of these summer camps, school speed zones will continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=420)|
| 0:07:05| to be active for the next six weeks at many of our elementary schools and next four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| at some of our middle schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| We will all need to get adjusted to this change, and I want to urge all Knox County residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| to take it slow when you drive by a school this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=437)|
| 0:07:20| I would also like to note that during our summer learning camps and upcoming school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| year, the district will continue to look to the guidelines from the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| of Education and the Tennessee Department of Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Masks are recommended but not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| Additionally, our school nurses will no longer be contact tracing and quarantining for COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| They will continue to follow up on positive cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| We also are welcoming families and visitors back to our schools, and we would ask everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| to continue to follow good practices of hand washing and social distancing when possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| And second, we've gotten off to a tremendous start on graduation ceremonies for the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| I believe we've had five graduations to date and 13 more, I believe, to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| I've seen a couple of board members at the five, it seemed like the two board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=483)|
| 0:08:07| representing those schools have been all those graduations thus far, so I look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| to seeing many others, many of you at the next several days' graduations here that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| we go through next Tuesday, I believe, and hoping that we can make it without rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| Now, rain's always welcome, but if it could just hold off for graduation ceremonies, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| would be very much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| I'm extremely proud of the class of 2021 for persevering through so many challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| this year, and I want to urge all of our graduates to be safe and make good choices as you celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| this wonderful milestone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| And finally, I want to congratulate the teams and individuals who won state championships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| at the state fling last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| I was thrilled to see many Knox County athletes excel, and we are very proud of all the athletes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| who competed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| Madam Chair, members of the board, this concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=536)|

| 0:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Since Ms. Satterfield is here, if we could, because I announced that Superintendent Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=550)|
| 0:09:16| and at least Ms. Henderson have to leave a little early to go to graduations, if we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| just skip ahead to go discuss regular agenda items and then come back to the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| that would be very helpful, I think, for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| So the first agenda item, the annual board calendar for 2022, you'll notice on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| that there what is being proposed is a slight adjustment from what we have been our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| that we've been following, which would move from having a Wednesday work session and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=588)|
| 0:09:54| next Wednesday regular session to do the work session on Monday and the regular session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| We were, we had this calendar for many, many years until I think we've been on this kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| of calendar for two years, maybe, maybe three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| So, so anyway, that's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| Any, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| I support this, going to this, but I'm just curious as to, do you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Because it's been the whole, my whole term has been what we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Do you know why we switched it over to how we're operating now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| The reason that it switched to Wednesday to Wednesday, I want to say that it was because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| of this meeting, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| A lot of it was so that we could get this boardroom for those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| I think that's the reason it kind of changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| I remember and went through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| The only problem with it was, and maybe most of those folks have retired or moved on to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| other places, but because of the short time frame, we were continuously getting information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=657)|
| 0:11:07| like the board would meet at five o'clock and we'd get information at maybe three o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| which sometimes was not time to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Having said that, the only comment that I will make, I have no objection to it as long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| as they get it to us in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=682)|
| 0:11:26| But the first time that somebody comes and says, oh, this needs to be approved, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| just couldn't get it in except two hours, I will support rejecting it in all probability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=693)|
| 0:11:42| because of that very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| If we could start down that road, then we'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| Unfortunately, in my opinion, something late like that, maybe it is necessary, but it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| to be rejected to teach staff people to abide by the rules and get it in on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=718)|
| 0:12:07| I'm not talking about the staff people we presently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| I'm just saying what has transpired in the past in my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| And we discussed the time frame because that's a big deal that if we move to this, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=738)|
| 0:12:28| have to adhere to the calendar, which says that, I'm trying to make this bigger, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| I think that it would be published the Tuesday before the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| So the Tuesday prior to the Monday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| So we discussed that when the superintendent and I talked about this along with his staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| we discussed that that would have to be a hard and fast deadline, that the agenda would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| have to be published by Tuesday so that board members would have at least six days to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Again, it wasn't the agenda that was the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| It was the problem of getting information at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| I don't know how you all feel about it since I guess none of you have experienced it except| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=796)|
| 0:13:23| the super, but those are my thoughts on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| It will go quicker than you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| And I realize that, you know, depending on the information, it may take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| But still, if we're going to adhere to the rules, we need to adhere to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| And before I go to other board members, Mr. Thomas, would you mind just weighing in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=829)|
| 0:13:50| Because I know in the past one of the other issues when we were on a Monday-Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| was that there is a, if board members have questions from the work session, that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| a quick turnaround for staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Do you feel like there would be enough time to get answers, you know, from Monday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| to Wednesday evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Yes, we've talked, as the staff talked about this, and we feel like that we can make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| Part of the consideration, I think, too, was just looking at staff time, and certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| staff time doesn't really matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Staff works whenever work needs to be done and also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| But when you look at the series of meetings that occur during a month, a lot of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| board workshops are going to be on the first Wednesday of the month, board meetings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| going to be on the second Wednesday of the month, commission workshops on the third Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| of the month, and commission meetings the fourth Monday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| So, you know, it's a situation for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| It's just almost like every week of the month, you know, we've got either commission or board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| And again, you know, we've done this and we'll continue to do it if that's what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| what the board desires, but it would give staff a little bit of break from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| from the evening meetings that we must attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you, Superintendent Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| I think Ms. Babb, and then we'll go to Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Yeah, overall I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| My question is, so this starts January 2022, so we would basically for the rest of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| until December we'd follow what we're doing right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| And then do we expect to be able to be in the new space in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| And if, I mean, if we ended up moving before that, we could change, we could vote to adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| our current, we adopted our board calendar way back, and we can discuss whether we, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| know, wanted to change it, but the thought is not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| The thought is to begin in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| I couldn't tell whose light it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| Okay, so Mr. Watson, is that your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Yeah, it's even hard to find which, but mine's over here by Jennifer, so it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| So my only experience is doing it the way we've done it so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| I've appreciated the time in between, a week in between meetings, but understanding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=960)|
| 0:16:06| history and some of the challenge that it creates, I certainly am fully open to trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| And I think we'll adjust to the new rhythm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Yeah, I really liked the Monday-Wednesday when we did it, because you got it, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| everything just knocked out that week, so it was kind of nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| I didn't think I would like the Wednesday-to-Wednesday, but I have, so, you know, there's advantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| to both ways, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| So, okay, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| One other comment, and I don't, I don't object to going to that, but occasionally you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=992)|
| 0:16:41| have a holiday that will fall on a Monday, and a national holiday, and then that moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| you to Tuesday wins, but those are kind of few and far between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| But it is something that, you know, that might occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Okay, and just, if anyone is here and has somebody that wants to watch, we are broadcasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| live currently on ctv.org, ctvnox.org, so the meeting can be found there, and then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1026)|
| 0:17:14| it will be on our website later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| All right, moving to the next agenda item, discussion and possible action on the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| of a facilitator for law enforcement memorandum of agreement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1046)|
| 0:17:31| So, in thinking about this, I just made some notes, so I'm just going to kind of read what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| I'm sure that you've all seen the letter from Mayor Jacob's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I've also received a letter from the town of Farragut and Mayor Ron Williams, and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1062)|
| 0:17:48| addition, county commission passed a resolution regarding this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| So, I'm sure you've all seen these, and so even though we had a conversation about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| on May 19th, since there's been a lot of conversation, the superintendent and I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| that it would be important for this board to discuss it, and if we're planning to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| action, that we take a vote, because otherwise it's just difficult, I think, to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| with kind of the state of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| And, you know, sometimes things take a little bit of time to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| And so, of course, I want to hear board members' thoughts and suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| What I would like to throw out, and I'm sure everybody has thoughts that they'll want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| put forth, but what I would like to throw out is whether it would be that each board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| member hold a community forum for their specific district and resident and then meet with Russ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1128)|
| 0:18:55| Oaks, with the new chief of security, what other appropriate personnel would be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| in that, and discuss what's best for your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| And there may be case-by-case items that come up from that that could be implemented in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1143)|
| 0:19:11| a more timely fashion on a case-by-case basis, rather than going through a long process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| could hold those up, since you might want to begin something at the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| So that was kind of my thought, and I just thought I would throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| And now I'd like to hear from board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| And I've had the opportunity, and I'm not going to put words into anybody's mouths, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| I had the opportunity to talk to a couple of the county commissioners, and then because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| we've had graduations and I've seen Mayor Jacobs, I've been able to talk to him, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| and just kind of been able to talk a little bit about really where these concerns are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| And I have expressed to everyone that I've talked to my reason behind the facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| and, you know, I think sometimes that has helped when I've explained what my views are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| which I don't necessarily think are the views of the whole board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| But when we talked about it, my thought on the facilitator, and this is, you know, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| reading Mayor Jacobs' letter and, you know, feeling that we shouldn't spend money and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| that we are capable of doing this ourselves, what I've expressed to them is I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| think there's a reason to distrust Knox County Schools, but I do think there are people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| our community that do, that do distrust us and don't think that our process is open and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1221)|
| 0:20:28| that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| And so that was the reason I supported a facilitator, not a consultant to tell us what to do, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| someone just to facilitate meetings and really to reach out to people, because the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| I felt like with a public forum of, like, me holding it is I'm going to talk to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| people that are mad, those are the people that we hear from, and I'm going to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| my friends who usually think like I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| And they're not necessarily eliciting some of the responses that I would like to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1254)|
| 0:21:00| from particular constituents, like, you know, certain student groups and that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| whereas I do think, like with the facilitator, you know, we put out there all the time, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| I do think we try to be very transparent and open of, you know, inviting people to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| but as we've gone to all these meetings that we have, it's the same five or six people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| that show up, versus if you actually invite particular people, they're much more likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| to come, versus just putting out an open invitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| So, I mean, I'm not going to, I'm not going to lose sleep over whatever we decide to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| but my reasoning behind doing a facilitator was just to try to seem to be open, to really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| try to get the viewpoints of some different groups of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| And I do think from everyone I've talked to, one of the biggest concerns was they felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| like our reason for doing this was to get security out of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| And what I've tried to express is I really think what would come out of community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| is how much our community values the officers and the security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| I mean, I'm not going to say there's not, everything's perfect, but, I mean, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| when, you know, when we got the letter from Mayor Kincannon, I think most of us heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| overwhelmingly, I heard from teachers, I heard from principals, I heard from parents, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| much they value and want our security in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| So, I have never felt like this process was trying to get them out of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| So, I do support having a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| I don't think it needs to be a huge, expensive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| I like the way we were coming up with it with the four meetings in four different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| But, once again, I'm not going to belabor it a whole lot either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| I agree that we need to have a facilitator, if nothing else, to keep us on track and keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| things moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Since we don't want to have a committee, I think we need to have someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1371)|
| 0:22:56| The community, I believe, also overwhelmingly prefers someone from somewhere else for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| same trust issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| And since money seems to be the issue, I would point out to the mayor that we had no travel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| expenses last year and there should be some money there that we could move over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| So, I read the mayor's letter and have not had a chance to talk with him in person yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| but I do have a meeting set up with him tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| And I've also spoken to Larson Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| And I think, I was not aware of the letter from the Town of Farragut, which is interesting, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| I think this has been an opportunity for people in different offices to make statements about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| the things that they value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| I mean, people need to do that in elected office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| But I think it's pretty clear from Mayor Jacobs' letter that I don't think Mayor Jacobs, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| I say this with all due respect, really understands the nature of what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| I mean, the opening line is we don't need to have a taxpayer, we don't need to pay somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| as a consulting firm to tell Knox County Schools what parents already know, that we need officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| Which, obviously, from our conversations on May 19th and other conversations, are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| the things that we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| So, I think to take an action based upon this letter or other resolutions that people may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| be making statements about, these things don't speak to the issue that we are discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1467)|
| 0:24:34| And so, to make a different action based upon something that's being suggested that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| not even talking about seems to me a little bit, maybe an odd thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| And I do think, and I echo what Ms. Babb says, that I don't think there's a specific reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1485)|
| 0:24:51| to distrust Knox County Schools, but I do often hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| And I think the nature of any good facilitation is that it's a third neutral party that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1496)|
| 0:25:03| continuing to drive the conversation forward to be able to get to some consistence in thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| and idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| And if Knox County Schools runs it, there's no way for Knox County Schools to run it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| a third party neutral way because it is the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| I mean, it's the party that's most at stake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| And again, I don't think, to me, it's not about individual staff or how they do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| I just think if we're going to invite the community in a meaningful way, which I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| consistently heard in our 2019 process, we didn't have an outside facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| The community didn't feel like they were brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| I remember reading the minutes from the time the MOA was approved, and there were several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| board members at that time who said, hey, can we pause this decision so we can invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| the community to the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| And it was still voted through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| And so what I don't want to do is repeat the method that was used last time where there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| was a high degree of distrust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And also, too, I think I could be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| I know we don't have specific dollar amounts yet, but this is going to be pennies on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| dollar per student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| This is not a million dollar effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| I mean, at a dollar per student, it's less than $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| It's not even going to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1581)|
| 0:26:23| So the cost is fairly minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| And not only do we have possibly funds from other line items that we can move over, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| also, I think, we could potentially apply ESSER funds to this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| I don't know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| But I don't think this is a large expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| And I also don't know, I mean, I've not seen this to be the habit of other elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| I don't see other letters that elected officials are weighing on to $20,000 expenses in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I just, I don't think that's a precedent that we want where elected officials are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| hey, you can't spend $20,000 on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| And then we kind of go a different direction from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| So I do hate, I'm not going to be able to vote on this issue, but I hate the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| I'm taking my wife to Puerto Rico to celebrate 20 years of marriage next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| But I would strongly advocate that the board use an outside facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| Because I think that's the best opportunity to set this process off on the right foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| Because it says to the community, right out of the gates, we're going to use facilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| to bring you to the table in a meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| And I also appreciated, Ms. Babb, what you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| I didn't think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| But when you were talking about, like, if we run this ourselves, like individual meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| who's going to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| I mean, I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| It's going to be the people in my district that I always hear from that are mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| And it's going to be, like, people who like to hang with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| And I'm not sure that's the people I most need to hear from in terms of this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| and what we do with the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| And as Ms. Babb, again, already stated, the public needs to be real clear that the memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| of agreement is between KCS and law enforcement institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| So by the nature of reviewing and possibly amending the MOA, by definition, we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| we're keeping them at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I mean, that's who the contract's with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| The process is not how do we disband the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| That's not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| We're talking about how do we review and amend it with the other bodies who are law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| So this is not about, again, I made this statement at least three other times now in other meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| This conversation, for some, has become about who loves police and who doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| And that's not the conversation we need to be having as a Board of Education, although| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| I know people will make statements about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| I probably said way more than I just needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| But it's just interesting to me that we're – not that we're talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| But it's easy to see that people are using this as an opportunity, as a platform to make statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1733)|
| 0:29:00| And I don't want our Board of Education to get sucked into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| People can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| And they go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| But I want to get to the business of addressing the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| And I think facilitation is the right way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| I echo everything that has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And Daniel, actually, my light's been coming on and off because I was like, is it even necessary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Because everything has been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| There's been three attempts to make a decision for Knox County School Board that we haven't made a decision on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1764)|
| 0:29:32| And so there's been three outside entities that have created more of a mess than we even desire or even intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1772)|
| 0:29:42| And so I would like for Knox County Schools to stay in the mindset that we're doing our jobs as Knox County School Board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| And our discussion and what we're deciding to do is what we have been hearing from community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| and what we know to be true from previous experiences with the MOA that community was not involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| So this is an opportunity to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| But it just feels like a bunch of mess from outside entities that's making our jobs really, really difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1806)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Mr. McMillan, and then we'll go back to Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| I guess this one would be for the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1818)|
| 0:30:23| Have you ever confirmed to what level if the city mayor was going to participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1823)|
| 0:30:34| We have a meeting scheduled for Thursday, this Thursday, with the city mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| Mayor Kincaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Well, it would appear to me, I mean, it's not something that's popped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| She's had plenty of time, and it appears that she either wants to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| but it's more like she wants to say she wants to participate, but string it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| We need to know yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| I agree, and we sent a letter last week, and as a result of the letter, we got a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| So I'm hoping Thursday will reveal whether or not the city wishes to continue with the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| Well, can I ask you something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| I mean, not that you need me to tell you how to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| but could you in your conversation with her, could you tell her that you need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1880)|
| 0:31:29| and if she doesn't give you a level of satisfactory participation, that you will assume that the answer is no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1889)|
| 0:31:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Would that be okay with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1903)|
| 0:31:44| I think the board would appreciate that, I think, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1904)|
| 0:31:49| But anyway, I'm not, it doesn't have anything to do with whether you support police or not police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1909)|
| 0:31:59| The fact is that the public, I believe, from the people I've talked to, it's not all people in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| it's different districts that I've had conversation with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| and I don't know that I've talked to any police officers whatsoever in reference to this subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1934)|
| 0:32:23| but I do believe overall Knox County citizens and taxpayers expect to have some officer in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1943)|
| 0:32:37| Now, it's up to us to decide how many and what that will be, but for that reason, I sort of support what Mayor Jacobs said in his letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1957)|
| 0:33:04| I don't know that it was the amount of money that he was so concerned about, I don't know, I haven't talked to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1984)|
| 0:33:15| but you're right, it's not a tremendous amount of money, but I think he made a valid point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=1995)|
| 0:33:24| We are elected as board members to run the Knox County school now, and we should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2004)|
| 0:33:34| We should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Now, could we have done a better job here before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| Yes, I think the answer is yes, without pointing any fingers at anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2020)|
| 0:33:47| But I don't have any reassurance that a facilitator or whatever you want to call it would make that any better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2027)|
| 0:34:03| I believe that there are intelligent people sitting around this table and that they should be able to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2043)|
| 0:34:15| Now, what we might do, it seems like it's more with one exception, and that was a tragic exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2055)|
| 0:34:26| it seems like it's more of an area or a community problem than it is a school problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2066)|
| 0:34:37| And I don't see any real need in getting into making more out of it where people are not having problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2077)|
| 0:34:53| I just can't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| And from the people I've talked to, you might have a fight or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| but you don't have any shootings or killings in the vast majority of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| And I think that this board could very well function, and if we were to determine not to have a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2111)|
| 0:35:22| then I think probably what we should do is in the area that's been impacted the most is Ms. Satterfield's area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2122)|
| 0:35:33| And I think we should step back for a little bit and let Ms. Satterfield be the point person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2133)|
| 0:35:42| She knows the community. She knows the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And they've got a new principal, and work with those people as well as the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2146)|
| 0:35:55| and then come back to us with a reasonable suggestion that could apply in that particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2155)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you, Mr. McMillan. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| So three things. One is I think, Mr. McMillan, I appreciate your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2175)|
| 0:36:20| I think some of what you were discussing elevates the conversation even beyond the specifics of the MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| which is what I think we're addressing around facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| And the reason why I think the MOA is such an important, tricky document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and I want to elevate this for the public because I want to make sure people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| why I even brought this issue up in the first place, is the MOA is between basically three entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2199)|
| 0:36:46| Knox County Schools, the Knox County Sheriff's Office, and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| And we have our own force, so all three of those institutions have people with arresting capabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2211)|
| 0:36:58| within Knox County Schools and can carry handguns in Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| And whenever you have multiple law enforcement agencies occupying the same space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2223)|
| 0:37:11| that becomes a unique challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And it's not about any one particular institution or any one particular officer that's carrying a gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| or not carrying a gun, but it's the whole premise beyond chain of command| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| and also when you have jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| I mean, there's a reason why multiple law enforcement agencies don't occupy the same jurisdiction often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| because when things hit the fan, it gets really tricky in terms of who's supposed to do what, when, and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| And the other authority that we also have within Knox County Schools that doesn't carry handguns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| is our administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| So you have multiple authorities all occupying the same space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| And the current MOA is nine pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| One page of that is a signature page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| It's very large print with very large margins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| And as I've spoken to people, not just in the community but in schools and even some law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| they acknowledge that it's a fairly vague document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| And it's fairly vague in terms of how those entities should interact in any one space at any one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| And I know of situations not just within Ms. Evedy's district but also in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2295)|
| 0:38:21| where things did hit the fan and people weren't sure exactly how to operate in that specific mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| And to me, those are the types of things that I want to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| I want to hear from that parent who's got that kid with autism who acts in a certain way that looks strange to you and I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2311)|
| 0:38:40| And I have a kid with sensory processing disorder, so I understand this, where it looks like bad behavior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| but it's actually something you can't control when it's a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| And I want to know how law enforcement is going to interact with that kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| I want to know what the expectation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| And our MOA doesn't really address that in terms of those other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| And so to me, there's real things that the community, if given the opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| will be able to speak into outside of should we have law enforcement or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| That's one question of a thousand questions in terms of how we do school safety and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| with multiple agencies occupying the same space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| And I think anybody from a common sense standpoint will say, oh, yeah, that would be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| If you have multiple people with weapons who all answer to different groups occupying the same space, that would be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| Our only way to mitigate that challenge is that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| That's the only thing that we have in writing to mitigate that challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| And so to me, that's the reason I brought this issue up in the first place is we need to have an opportunity for the community to engage in a meaningful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2376)|
| 0:39:44| And I'm not trying to give away my responsibility as an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| What I'm saying is because we hire lots of people to do lots of things, that I know, and Babs said this in the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2389)|
| 0:39:57| I don't know that we have the skill set in this body to do that type of facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| And I also don't know that the community would trust it because, again, we are the party that is the lead in the contract, in the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2403)|
| 0:40:13| So we can't operate at an arm's length because, I mean, we are all up in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| And so that's why, again, a good facilitator, all they're doing is moving the conversation forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| Mr. Thomas, and I didn't tell you I was going to ask this, and if you want Renee to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| She sent me some notes on this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| But would you just let the board know what steps you've already taken since May 19th in response to possibly hiring a facilitator?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2434)|
| 0:40:42| We've looked at a couple of options in terms of facilitators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| We've also developed an action plan, I guess, in terms of whoever the chosen party is to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| And so we've taken those steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| And then about that time, I guess, the mayor's letter came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| And then we sort of suspended any activity at that point to make a determination, let the board decide what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2461)|
| 0:41:08| You want us to follow up because the contract or agreement, after talking to Mr. Duper, would come back to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| and also, I guess, to the commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| So thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| And I know you don't have dollar amounts yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| We're not to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| But this is going to be hard for you to do because of the position that you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| And I totally respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| And you and I had this conversation a little bit earlier the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| But if the relationship with the mayor was not of concern, and I know it is and it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2496)|
| 0:41:45| given your experience in Knox County Schools over decades now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| do you think it's important for us as a school system in this situation, in this context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| to hire an outside facilitator for this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| Well, in terms of, you talk about the board skill set, and I'll talk about the staff skill set, which is phenomenal, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2521)|
| 0:42:09| But in terms of staff time and expertise doing this, somebody that does it for a living obviously could do it better than us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2529)|
| 0:42:19| And at the time, I was very supportive of this idea, actually, before the letter came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| But I'll say this, too, and not that this will create an adversarial relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| But I have been around times when there was an adversarial relationship with county government, with the mayor, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2552)|
| 0:42:41| It actually ended up in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| And the board, as I understand, Gary can weigh in on this much better than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| but it's the board's budget and the board can do what the board wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| The way I look at it, though, I try to, and our staff tries to, we try to get along as well as we can with county government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2573)|
| 0:43:01| county finance, county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| I mean, the county mayor has funded our budget, everything we've asked for at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| So when the county mayor makes a request to us, I just feel like, hey, I need to listen to that and consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| But obviously I work for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| So, you know, in terms of excluding all other factors, an outside party would bring expertise that we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2596)|
| 0:43:24| But, you know, do you win this battle and lose the war?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| So, Superintendent, one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| So then do you, I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| I'm going to come back to you to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| I think Mr. McMillan and then Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| In the situation that you just described, Mr. Watson, with the autistic child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2632)|
| 0:44:00| would you not think that the principal, the guidance people, and that that would be a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2640)|
| 0:44:11| that they would work with anybody that was in law enforcement that was going to be in their school on a daily basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2651)|
| 0:44:21| And would that not be solved that way as opposed to some other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2661)|
| 0:44:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| I think to me you seem to be like you were drawing law enforcement into it when it was unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2668)|
| 0:44:37| Mr. McMillan, I didn't draw law enforcement into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| We've heard from a parent this year that had that very situation with her autistic son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| I mean, she came and shared with this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| And the reality is that from everything I understand from that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| from talking to the principal and talking to the parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| what you just described would have been great, but that's not what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Well, you mentioned that we could get into a thousand questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| And you were correct about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| If we, in my opinion, if we had a facilitator, we could go on and on and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2711)|
| 0:45:20| because everybody would have something different that they wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| We can't solve, no matter whether we have one or not, we can't solve every situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2725)|
| 0:45:34| This is not something that's absolute, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| Now, you talked about all the things that, you know, having somebody that could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2740)|
| 0:45:49| that did have the expertise and the judgment to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2749)|
| 0:45:56| Do you know what type of person you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2756)|
| 0:46:01| I'm not asking you to name names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| but do you think we could come up with somebody that would satisfy the whole ball of whack, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2762)|
| 0:46:11| There are certainly, and I've worked with many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| none of them I would suggest for this process because I don't think that would be received well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| I've worked with many great facilitators over time, and I think others on this board have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| That wasn't what I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| You asked me if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| I asked you if you said at the end of the day that they would direct us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| or guide us to where we would be able to come up with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| that would have the expertise and the judgment to work with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| Mike, I'm not sure why we keep doing this every meeting, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| I'm not doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| You're the one that keeps dragging it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Now, if you want to drag it out, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| You said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Did you not say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| You didn't imply that at the end of the day we could reach a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| where somebody would be responsible for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| This board would be responsible for approving an MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| I've not tried to delegate that responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| So how would we find that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| Last time we met on May 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| we asked the superintendent to help find that person, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| I didn't ask for this meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2846)|
| 0:47:27| I'm not dragging it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2847)|
| 0:47:28| And I'm not faulting the person who did ask for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| I've been clear and consistent since the day I brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| that I think we need facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Well, I don't think we do, and I intend to not support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2862)|
| 0:47:43| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| One other thing, just as an added thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| To me, this might be a poor analogy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| but there are 95 counties in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| If Knox County or, say, Jefferson County were having some kind of a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| you wouldn't go get the governor to pass something that applied statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| We don't need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| And the reason I say that is we're not having all these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| at all these other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| We need to work to do what I suggested a while ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| with the first district, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| And I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| I did want to address something that you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| and it was kind of talking about the MOU or MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| and I guess the brevity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| And it does concern me if we are going to try to micromanage a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| between us and our law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| I mean, I want a community meeting, and I want to hear input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| but I do think, and once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| this is going to be something we're all going to have to come together about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| my personal feelings is I don't think we can look at every situation that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| happen and everything else and try to add all of it into an MOA or MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| to how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| And so it does concern me how much kind of almost micromanaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| we might get into with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| And that's just a concern of mine, and I do want the process to play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| But at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| I do think it's got to allow some flexibility for our partners in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| And this isn't something to debate tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| I just wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| Thank you, Madam Chair and Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I just want to say I am in support of Mayor Jacob's letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| I think we were each elected to represent our district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| to be a voice for our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| KCS has meetings and takes public input all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| so I just personally find a facilitator unnecessary in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| I think we're getting off track of what we're actually talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| What we're talking about is a memorandum of understanding between all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| Knox County schools, the entity, and our law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| We are not making a memorandum of agreement district by district by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| So when we're talking about facilitating the memorandum of agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| it can't be done individually by each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| It needs to be a Knox County schools memorandum of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| with our law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| It's incumbent on all of us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| And everyone's been very diplomatic in discussing this letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3048)|
| 0:50:57| But the bottom line is it's very clear in the law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| county government only approves our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| They cannot tell us how to spend line items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| And so that kind of overreach is something that we need to be very careful of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3069)|
| 0:51:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| I think I had Ms. Satterfield and then Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| I just want to say things that are happening in District 1 are heightened right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3085)|
| 0:51:32| in media realities, but I also know that a lot of things are covered up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| because it's a smaller population throughout our different districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| and what it means to be in relationship with law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| and how you look at law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I'm still really troubled at the fact that there's a perception that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| Knox County Schools wants to remove law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| We've never discussed that as a board, and we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| And from the feedback that we have received from emails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| you're right, Mr. Mike, that that is the consensus overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3128)|
| 0:52:13| But I do know that there's ways that we can improve the relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| with law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| There are ways that we can figure out various solutions that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| don't have the answers to, and this is not my level of expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| and I don't have those everyday interactions with law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| and that's where you get the opportunity to get input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3152)|
| 0:52:38| I just completely echo what Board Member Owens just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| that I don't ever want to be in a position where we're making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| based off an outside entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| We know we are elected to do what's best for kids and keep kids first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3172)|
| 0:52:58| And so I'm really uneasy by the outside governing bodies kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| heavy-handing what needs to be done with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| It just feels really wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| It feels really wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| And this, I think in the resolution thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| it was like $5,000 that you recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| Well, it was for a number of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| It was actually 50, but it was more than just facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| And so the facilitation, it's peanuts in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| So to have a letter and just – and I didn't even plan on talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| this because it really is – to put this out there as if we're about to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| spend $150,000, $200,000 on gathering community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| it feels misleading and that's not the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Superintendent Thomas was stopped in his tracks from doing what the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| has directed him to do because of outside entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| And I was elected in this role position to run – to be the voice for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3233)|
| 0:53:59| District 1 and to figure out the best way to move things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| And from my constituents, community input has not been valued from how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| we make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| If we haven't been able to get that right for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| we need to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| And so that is directly comments from my community saying the facilitator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| might be a good approach because we haven't been able to get it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| historically, so let's try something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| And I just want to also make it clear that even reading this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| I have strong trouble with people who are in leadership that are unable to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| see different perspectives because I have never had an issue with law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| They've always been a supporter whenever I meet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| But when I think of safety, I don't think of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| And there's communities that do think of law enforcement when it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| And so for people to be in leadership that are unable to have willingness to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| hear a different perspective, that's troubling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| This letter is basically saying police are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| And that's not true for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| That's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| And so I just hope that as we continue to go move Knox County forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| Knox County Schools forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| and leadership is able to open up their perspectives and their mindset to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| different perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| Thank you, Ms. Patterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Okay, I think Mr. Watson was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Superintendent, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| I remembered what I was going to actually ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| So when you and I talked the other day, I shared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| I don't know if you felt this was the view or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| I felt that maybe Mayor Jacobs didn't really understand the intent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| And I even made the comment to you at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I said, I doubt he watched the meeting on the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| I can't imagine he went back and watched the video and the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| So I think he was probably interpreting the intent of the board from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| people he talked to or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Again, I'm meeting with him tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| And so I made the comment to you at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I said it would be interesting if we made a decision not to do what we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| already agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3363)|
| 0:56:04| I thought there was consensus on May 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3364)|
| 0:56:06| I felt like we left the room and said there was consensus to hire a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| You started acting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| But that's actually what Mayor Jacobs' letter is not about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| Mayor Jacobs' letter is not about a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| I mean, when you read the words, that's not what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| And so I thought it would be an interesting, it would be a shame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| if we changed our course about something we chose to do because we got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| letter about something we weren't intending to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| And so I asked at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| if you've been able to speak with Mayor Jacobs to help give him some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| context about what we're actually intending to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| I've not been able to do that yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| but I'm curious if you've had an opportunity to speak with Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| and provide some context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Yes, I did speak briefly with Mayor Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| and he said he did understand what the board was wanting to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| and he still thought that it was something the board ought to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| You were elected by your constituents to represent them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| and he thought that it should be handled that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| So I want to point out, this is a stark observation for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| and maybe nobody else has seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| So on May 19th, this board left that room with consensus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3428)|
| 0:57:12| we were going to hire a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| We got a letter from another elected official that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| hey, you're the board, you're the elected body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| you should know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| And because of this letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| we're now going to change what we knew to do on May 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| So that's an interesting dynamic, because we're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| well, yeah, we are the elected officials, we should make decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| but we're making them potentially based on a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| from another elected official that's not over Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| And that's not an indictment on Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Mayor Jacobs can make comments about whatever he wants, whenever he wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| and I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| But his comment was, you're the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| do what you think to be best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| and on May 19th, I thought we had decided what we thought would be best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| I mean, we left that room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| and I think the superintendent felt that way because he started acting on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| I mean, I don't think you would have acted unless you felt there was consensus, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| But I guess as a result of the events that took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| I want the board to tell me what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Yeah, Bob, I get where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3495)|
| 0:58:17| You're like, hey, I don't want to keep going without board approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| And I get that, and I'm down with an approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| I'm just saying in this room, in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| we're saying potentially that, oh, maybe now we don't want a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3504)|
| 0:58:29| but the only thing that changed was we had somebody say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| hey, you're the elected board, do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| That just to me is an interesting dynamic observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| Well, and I'll come to Mr. McMillan in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| But, you know, there was basically consensus around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| However, I think that I had reservations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3527)|
| 0:58:53| and I think that receiving all of these letters, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| kind of caused me to pause and think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| And, you know, I mentioned on the 19th that I'm concerned about getting into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| micromanaging what's happening amongst the bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| and in specific situations in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| And I'm not sure that – I'm not sure if – well, I think a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| I agree with Mayor Jacobs that we have a representative form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| We've been elected to represent our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| And so we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| And I think also that the agencies – we can help identify what the issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| but I think at the end of the day the agencies are going to have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| together and figure out do we need more training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| do we need more guidelines that are written procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| do we need – what are the issues and how are they fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| So I think the public can help us, the parents and the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| and the principals can help identify what the issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| and can offer suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| But at the end of the day, the bodies that actually do that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| and have the law enforcement expertise need to figure out, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| how do we fix this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| You know, what is the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Then they're going to have to be the ones who help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| who really hammer out how to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| And obviously, you know, parents will have suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| But the other reservation that I have is going through a big, long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| and as far as the MOA is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| I'm not sure we're going to have a much more specific MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| than we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| So we're using a lot of time and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| The other thing I'm concerned about is how much staff time is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| So I know that was a pro as far as facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| But, you know, I know we want the staff to focus on academics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| and focus on it just seems like everything's kind of gotten pushed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| and we want to get that back to be in the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| So I'm concerned about that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| So the more I thought about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| the issue of the focus group came up at our May 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3681)|
| 1:01:25| The more I think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| I don't know how we could recommend people for a focus group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| And we kind of talked about it that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| The more I thought about it, I thought, you know, how do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| How do you pick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| How do you go about doing that whole process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| So I think there's a lot of issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| So after all of these things, that's why kind of in my mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| I came back to board members having, you know, their own public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| getting information, and then sitting down with the decision makers to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| here's the problem, how could we fix this problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| So that's kind of my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| And I know we've got more lights on now based on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Mr. McMillan was first, and then I think it was Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| and then Ms. Edwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| I think your comments were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| As best I recall, some of us had other things to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| so we had a limited amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| And it was like it's been thrown out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| but the ones that did not object,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| it wasn't that they were fully supportive of it at that moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| It was just like, you know, I'm not going to say anything now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| I want to think this over and have a little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| I think that is where Mr. Watson may have misread things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3774)|
| 1:03:02| But in reference to what Ms. Owens said about where we're getting away from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3782)|
| 1:03:13| in certain places we don't have a problem, Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| So why do we need to come up with something to correct that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3800)|
| 1:03:27| or look at correcting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| I just think that you need to concentrate on where the problems are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| and deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| Ms. Warren, I agree with all the statements you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| I think all those are considerations, and I think at the end of the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| those groups will need to get into the room and hash it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| I'm not sure how the question at hand about the mode in which we gather community feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| impacts the things that you just referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| I mean, to use a facilitator or not, I don't know that I'm –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3844)|
| 1:04:09| and if it does, I want you to help me understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| I don't know how facilitation prevents what you're wanting to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| that those folks get in the room and make decisions, how that impedes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| I mean, I think the point I think that Mayor Jacobs had was spending money to hold meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3862)|
| 1:04:32| I think his viewpoint probably is that it's unnecessary because we could, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| as an elected leader, you can gather that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| But with all due respect, Madam Chair, I'm asking you what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| How does facilitation potentially impede your objective of getting those stakeholders at hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3882)|
| 1:04:50| to ultimately make a decision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| I think a lot of the concern, I think the fact that we've gotten letters from all these different entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3891)|
| 1:04:57| is that hiring a facilitator really elevates the conversation into a much bigger –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3897)|
| 1:05:06| a very – kind of a bigger thing that has then caused people to feel uneasy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3906)|
| 1:05:14| that it's caused the public, which these people represent, to feel uneasy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| because it seems like we're – that even though it hasn't been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| nobody on this board has ever said they want to not have law enforcement in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| It's never been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| But I think the conversation itself has made people uneasy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| Yeah, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| And I would say that some of these letters actually add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| that overall concern that people are feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| I mean, because actually it's all been letters so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| I think we've gotten five letters now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| So five letters this board has gotten from different entities, a community group, to both mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| well, three mayors, I guess, and a county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| So all those letters have actually been the thing that have confused the situation and elevated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| And I guess I would just advocate for this board to control the narrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| and do what we think is the best thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| irregardless of what's the headline on Knox Canoe Sentinels about the latest letter we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3973)|
| 1:06:24| Well, which I think the whole point of today's discussion is that we can't do that, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| if we haven't had a vote on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Yeah, so that's kind of where we are currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| I think our focus needs to be on our students and our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| and absolutely not on letters that we receive, regardless of who they're from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| especially when many of those letters are not even addressing what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| They're addressing a completely different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| It's completely clear in many of the letters and the e-mails that we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| that it's not that people disagree with having a facilitator or with reviewing the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| It's that they don't understand what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| And if we're going to look at that and be swayed by people who don't even know what the issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4031)|
| 1:07:22| then we have a pretty serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| I would also say that another reason we need a facilitator is because this very thing that we're doing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4045)|
| 1:07:39| one month we have consensus, the next month we're doing something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4059)|
| 1:07:45| We are too dysfunctional to do this without a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| I'll say I think the process that we talked about on May 19th was very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| I mean, it seemed like it would be a very long process to try to do all of those things that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| So I don't necessarily think that it was a simple process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| Bottom line also, as far as whether we're dysfunctional or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| I think that we, as Ms. Babb made a reference to last time or in a past meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4091)|
| 1:08:17| is that we are voting to represent our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| So I think that's, we're voting to represent our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| So I'm not sure that, I guess I question if we go through a big, long process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| whether we're going to kind of get back to pretty much the same MOA that we currently have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| because I think that there are other issues that need to be dealt with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| and agreed upon with the actual people doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| So, and I don't know that that would actually end up in an MOA, because it would be too specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| So I'm also looking at the end result and how we're, where we're trying to arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4133)|
| 1:08:59| Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Yeah, I don't really have a strong opinion about it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4141)|
| 1:09:05| And, you know, I stated in the very beginning that it was a conversation I felt like I should be involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| with my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| And I don't really think that we're too dysfunctional to have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| I think people are hearing pieces of what other board members are saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| and they're focusing on these pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| Because I've heard everybody say that it's a conversation they'd be willing to have with their constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| And I think so we're kind of picking and choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| You know, maybe we've not voiced strong opposition against one person's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| but I still think that we've had all these other opinions have been there all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Okay, any other conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Okay, so thank you for that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| Let's go back and begin with the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4202)|
| 1:10:12| Any questions on contracts 1 or 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| 3 or 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| 5 or 6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4224)|
| 1:10:28| 7, 8, or 9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| Okay, and then board policy, I-161.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4239)|
| 1:10:48| Mr. Dukla, would you like to comment on this, or we can go straight to board questions, whichever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| I can, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4254)|
| 1:10:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| I think Jason Meyer can help us with maybe some more specifics from his end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| because this is something this department deals with day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| But I can tell you that there were several concerns that were coming before the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| and the reason for this proposed policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| The foremost one was, and I struggle with the word, surreptitious recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4276)|
| 1:11:22| You know, in other words, recording without knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Without all parties' knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| And although we realize that it's not a crime in Tennessee because it's only one-party consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| that does present a problem when school personnel and parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| and other professionals come together to try to work out something that's in the best interest of a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| and then they either don't know about the recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| or perhaps someone comes with a recording to the meeting unannounced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4312)|
| 1:11:57| and just says at the beginning of the meeting, oh, hey, here's my phone, I'm recording this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| So that was one issue that was presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| Another issue is that FERPA, and that is that once a recording is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| that it has to be held onto by the school system, has to be part of the educational record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4334)|
| 1:12:22| And so that's something that the school system likely would need to have some procedures around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4342)|
| 1:12:30| in addition to a policy because, again, that's a requirement from FERPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| And then I think another concern was the fact that these IEP meetings can be quite long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4355)|
| 1:12:43| An hour, two hours, three hours, and then someone might take a recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| and just take a very small snippet of that recording completely out of context out of a very long meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| So that was the impetus for opposing the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| Mr. Myers, would you like to weigh in on your department's view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| Or we can go with questions, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| I can do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| The position of my department would be that we support the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4396)|
| 1:13:21| Essentially what it will do is it will allow us to develop some procedures around this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4401)|
| 1:13:27| The policy is in no way banning recording these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Rather, it's asking that you give notice, and then there's an approval mechanism within it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| So it allows us to explore the purpose of the recording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4419)|
| 1:13:42| Some of the concerns I've heard coming from folks would be, you know, it's a two-parent family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| One parent is sick or unable to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| Would that be an absolute no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| Probably something we would permit, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| The spirit of the policy is to help us create procedure and consistency across the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4436)|
| 1:14:02| so that what's permissible in one school is also going to be permissible at another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| because the policy would then become the guiding kind of light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Currently, it would just be a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| So a parent comes in to decide if they're going to record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Right now, all we do is just record it also, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| I think we also have to recognize that within the last ten years, a lot has changed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| Everyone is carrying with them today a high-quality recording device all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| Also, within this school year, you have the added variable of virtual meetings, team meetings, Zoom meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4471)|
| 1:14:37| All those things, you know, allow for screen recordings and various other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| So I think the policy is important in that it develops a structure for us to build some procedures around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| I appreciate our conversation earlier today, too, about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| Do you see any sense of urgency to get this passed on second reading in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| which would be the meeting that would come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| or would you be okay with us taking a month to see if there might be any unintended consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4505)|
| 1:15:12| from some of the specific language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| I certainly understand the need for the policy and support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| but I would like to dig into some of the specifics around the language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| with some other people who, I know I've been through IEP meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| but other parents who have and also other professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| just to see if there's specific wording that we might want to also consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| Sure, yeah, if that were the pleasure of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| To answer the question the short way, no, this is not an emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| something that we're trying to get pushed through immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| Like when we spoke earlier today, we'll have IEP meetings rocking and rolling from now until August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4542)|
| 1:15:49| even with school not being in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| There will be various evaluations and new IEPs and things that we have to get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| and we're going to roll forward with those whether this policy is in place or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| So it's not an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| It's not something that I'm like, oh, gosh, we've got to get this in place by August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| I do think it's an important policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| I think it's something that the board should consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| but it's not like an emergency kind of thing where it's, man, we've got to get this done right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| As I mentioned earlier, I won't be at the meeting next week to make this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| but if anybody would want to do that, I would support pushing pause on this for a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| and let us look into the word language a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| Ms. Fab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| Yeah, I feel like the intent of this is just full disclosure of when taping is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| and I guess I heard from a parent, at least one, that I'm kind of concerned over the B part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| It's not a problem of like them having to ask permission, but the B on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4606)|
| 1:16:51| like the parent that contacted me sort of said, you know, you're frazzled in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| Sometimes you just want it so that you actually have documentation at the end so that you know what went on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| and I've never been in an IEP meeting, but I've been in sort of a tense meeting where I walked away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| and I'm like, well, what did really happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| So I sort of saw what they were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| and so I think there was a little bit of concern on when that would be requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| when it would be denied, and why it would be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| So that was one question I had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| and the other one is on the bottom where it talks about recordings that Knox County Schools does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| If we do the recording, is that available for the parents to have access to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| So in terms of if we did the recording, would parents have access, the answer would be yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| because it would become part of the student's record if we recorded the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| In terms of when we would say no, you know, just impromptu being asked that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| I think, you know, it gets to intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| Is there some sort of malicious intent to move it forward with the recording, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| If a person genuinely just wants it so that they can revisit it later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| I think that that's something certainly that the principal could consider approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4679)|
| 1:18:06| if that was the decision they wanted to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| Again, if this policy is passed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| I'm sure my department will work with principals to develop some guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| and some guidance for them for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| I would also say that, you know, a big part of the IEP team process is the meeting notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| The meeting notes are part of the IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| They're agreed upon and reviewed during the IEP team meeting like any other part of the IEP team, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4707)|
| 1:18:34| So that in itself becomes something that a family can revisit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| in terms of trying to reflect on the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| So if there's something that family wanted to be included in the meeting notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| and it was appropriate to do so, it would be recorded there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| And when I say recorded, in this instance, I mean documented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| And one thing you've just even brought up is kind of my lack of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| I mean, I have not had a child go through an IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| I really don't, you know, as you said, you know, obviously there are notes and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| I don't even know what's obvious about an IEP or what the process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| So I don't know if there is some information maybe that could be shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| And there's probably some school people that have been involved in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| and maybe have more information than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| But maybe some of my problem a little bit is even my lack of knowledge of the IEP process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| which maybe would help at least me at the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| I don't know if other board members feel like they totally understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| I think, like, my concerns would be, like, just procedures for principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| if they were going to deny it, sort of what is the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| So it's a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Like we're saying, we're trying to have a level across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| that there are level procedures for a principal to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| And then also what is the process for A, of a parent making sure that they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| that if they want to record it, they need to give the two days' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| And just so that we know that, you know, we don't have parents that are like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| well, I didn't know that and that kind of stuff, which, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| I don't have a problem really with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| I think it's just more giving due notice to everybody and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| Thank you, Ms. Fabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Yes, I just have a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| So without permission, recording is prohibited, and if it still happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| it just goes to the student's file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| I think the question that I was addressing where I said it would go into the student's file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| was if for some reason the district, we as a district, said we're going to record the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| then would the parent have access, and the answer would be yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| because it's part of the student record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| I can't imagine a scenario where we would say we're not going to approve the recording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4830)|
| 1:20:37| and then record it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| I think there would be reciprocity there, and we would say no recording,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| and that would include ourselves and also not record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| Okay, let me, I think I asked it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| Thank you for that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| That's good information too, but I didn't ask the question right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| What's the consequence if they record it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| Well, because I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| My question is currently can, maybe this is kind of to your question too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4860)|
| 1:21:06| currently can people record without our knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| Is it permissible that they can currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| No, I just want to know if this goes, if this happens, what's the consequence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| Sure, go ahead, Mr. Fink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Thank you, Madam Chair, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| So, yeah, that's a good question, and the answer would be that if somebody's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| I mean recording without the district's knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| then at least the district would have something to say to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| maybe we need to redo this, or maybe we need to go back and revisit this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| because this was done without this procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| The whole point of the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| and resulting procedures that Mr. Myers was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| would be to put those parameters around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| Right now, I mean, frankly, you're dealing, for lack of better terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| wild, wild west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| I mean, anybody can record because Tennessee is just the one-party consent state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4923)|
| 1:22:11| and Knox County Schools isn't doing that, as Mr. Myers is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| I mean, Knox County Schools isn't making these recordings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| but what you're doing is you're having third parties come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| and then make such recordings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| and then we obviously can't control that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| Once it's done, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| I'd like to see this policy go through the usual process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| the usual adoption process, and go through policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| so we could have some discussion about a lot of this language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| Anytime we try to prohibit something without consequence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| I don't think we can prohibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| There's not a way to do that when there's no consequence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| So it may just be that the language needs to be adjusted to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4976)|
| 1:23:05| more positively encourage permission rather than prohibiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| because I think that gives someone...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| It would make me want to record it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| So I think if we could have some time to discuss this in the policy review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5000)|
| 1:23:28| I think we might find some other ways to say this that might work out better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5008)|
| 1:23:34| for the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| All right, moving on to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Any questions on A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| C or D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| Ms. Satterfield, your light is on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| but I don't think you mean for it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| Any questions on E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| All right, any questions on contracts A and B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| C and D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| E and F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| And that gets us to the end of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| I missed it in the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Is it okay if I ask a question around D4, the items and contracts with talking points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| I missed that being read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| I was trying to follow along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| D4 on the talking points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5080)|
| 1:24:41| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5081)|
| 1:24:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| Mr. Myers, would you mind just sharing a little bit about what talking points is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| and why it's a valuable opportunity for some of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| and how we might even potentially leverage it to a further extent in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Yeah, just really briefly, it's a really great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| Some of our teachers are actually already leveraging a free version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| This will allow us to expand into all the community schools as a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| Really what the program does is it gives us access to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| just over 100 different languages to push communication out to our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| I think it's text-based, so it's pretty user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| It's really intended to supplement what we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| so it's not going to replace School Messenger or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5130)|
| 1:25:34| That's not at all the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| The intent really is just to give our staff one more tool to sort of tackle the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| that we know we have with communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| The paid version gives us some tools where we can analyze who's actually receiving the message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| are they accessing the message, and that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| I believe we can cross-reference that with what's in Aspen to sort of determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| is the phone line still active, do we need to try to get updated contact information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| and that sort of thing, which would be incredibly valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| We know that some of the families we serve, their contact information changes frequently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| so it gives us another tool to help with that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| It should be a pretty great opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| I know Ms. Schlisher and her department are really excited to get it rolled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| But again, its intent is to supplement what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| and just give staff another tool to communicate with families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| I'm excited about it, and I had not heard about it prior to it being brought to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| and love that we're going to be able to engage with that many more folks in their native language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| And also, correct me if I'm wrong, but it is text-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| but if a parent were for whatever reason to not be able to publish their phone bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| and don't have text that month, they also have an app they can download to the phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| so they can still receive these communications even if their cell phone plan is interrupted, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| And I believe we can also send video messages as well for families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| who maybe are not literate in their home language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| It gives us a lot of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| I think any other questions on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| Then we will move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| Please, Ms. Fab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5245)|
| 1:27:26| I'd like to now call Gordon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5246)|
| 1:27:30| Please state your name and county of residence, and you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5250)|
| 1:27:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| I'm Gordon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| I live in Knoxville at 523 North Bertrand Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5260)|
| 1:27:48| Upon first glance, policy I-161 appalled me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| because it seems to me to be 180 degrees out of sync with where the school system would want to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5277)|
| 1:28:08| Now, I do understand that surreptitious recording of any meeting is uncomfortable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5288)|
| 1:28:19| but I can imagine if I were a parent going into an IEP meeting knowing my child has some needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5299)|
| 1:28:30| that will need to be addressed, I would really want to be assured that I could record the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5310)|
| 1:28:44| so that I wouldn't have to say, could you spell that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| You know, tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| I'm not sure I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| Could you repeat that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| If I'm a parent going in, talking to two or three or four school officials, I would want that okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5335)|
| 1:29:11| This basically says you may not, unless you ask permission and we grant it, which we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5351)|
| 1:29:21| So I think this at best needs reworking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5361)|
| 1:29:28| I've had some experience of being in meetings where people are tense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5368)|
| 1:29:35| I spent seven years as a federal investigator investigating employment discrimination claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| When I walked into a company's offices to begin the investigation, I was not the most popular person in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5384)|
| 1:29:55| People were tense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| It was my job to assure them of my fairness, that I was interested in the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5398)|
| 1:30:07| I wasn't interested in skewing any facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5407)|
| 1:30:13| In an IEP meeting, it's the school officials who hold those cards and need to be caring for the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5413)|
| 1:30:23| so that the parents can care for the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| So please rework this so that it is student positive and parent positive and protective of the rights of the staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5428)|
| 1:30:44| Certainly it could say there shall be no recording without permission and announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5444)|
| 1:30:55| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| So at the beginning of an IEP meeting, one of the questions would be, are you recording this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5456)|
| 1:31:04| You may if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| The answer to that, everybody then knows is it being recorded or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| But this policy as written really doesn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5476)|
| 1:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Erin Keck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| Please state your name and county of residence, and you'll have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| My name is Erin Keck, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| I want to address the letter that Mayor Jacobs wrote to all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| in which he says that he strongly opposes using tax money to hire outside consulting firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| to tell the district what every parent in Knox County already knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| law enforcement officers are a necessity in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| First of all, let me tell you that he does not speak for this Knox County parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| I do not believe that law enforcement is as much of a necessity as social workers, nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| and guidance counselors, of which not all Knox County schools have on a full-time basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5528)|
| 1:32:14| That is what this parent believes is a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| Also, he was incorrect in saying, as some of you have addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5537)|
| 1:32:21| that you are wanting to have someone tell Knox County schools what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| but instead to have a neutral third party come and listen to the concerns of people in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5545)|
| 1:32:31| I'm really not sure why that's such a problem with some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| Listening to some of the things that were said tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| I just want to address the idea that this is a specific school or community problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5558)|
| 1:32:44| and not a school board problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| That's erroneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| These instances happen in multiple districts, and we've heard that from parents in these meetings themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| And so I take a little bit of offense to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| I grew up going to Knox County schools, and I'm a parent of a child in Knox County school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| I also think it would be wrong to have meetings just district by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| where you're only listening to the people in your own district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| because then no one is able to learn from other people's experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| We learn nothing from talking but only by listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| As Mr. Watson has said in his resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| and in some of the meetings trying to explain the misinformation around that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| this is not a reaction to the tragic killing of Anthony Thompson Jr. in the bathroom of his school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| This is a problem that many of us have been trying to address for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| In March 2020, I attended the Disparities in Educational Outcome meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| specifically the breakout session about discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| There was a lot of really pretty graphs and charts that talked about the discipline stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| But when I asked directly about the discipline stats related to law enforcement with our children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| I was assured that this is not something that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Law enforcement is not disciplining the children in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| But that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| When I pushed a little bit further, I was told that maybe this year that would be included in the stats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| It wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| I was at this year's meeting as well, again in the community meeting forum in discipline breakout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| Of course, this year there were a lot of really angry and upset people there from my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| We were assured by the superintendent's chief of staff that this was not the time or place for this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| but one of those meetings would happen very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| That was two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| We're still here debating whether we should have a meeting such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| The story got a little personal for me this year when my elementary school-aged daughter came home from school upset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| because when she was on the playground, she saw a law enforcement officer threaten two little girls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| that she would put them in handcuffs if they didn't stop yelling at each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| I was pretty upset by the story, as I've heard similar stories from community members and friends and at meetings like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5684)|
| 1:34:51| I talked to the principal, and she was pretty confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| She obviously didn't know this was happening, and she also assured me that law enforcement does not handle discipline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| in my child's elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| Later, I also contacted the sergeant that was in charge of that district, as I was told to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5703)|
| 1:35:08| because the principals don't have any authority over the law enforcement in their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| It would be nice if when problems happened, other staff could step in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| but as soon as a law enforcement officer steps in, according to our current MOA, they have all authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5715)|
| 1:35:21| So I did call the sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| He was very responsive, and he assured me that he would take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5723)|
| 1:35:27| Two months later, my daughter came home from school, fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| When she was in art class, the same officer walked into her class, looked around, and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| I don't deal with this class. There's a certain parent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| My child knew exactly the parent that that officer was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| She came off the set and asked me, am I going to get in trouble, Mom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| Am I getting someone fired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| Why does my 10-year-old have that on her heart, when all she did was tell me something that she saw wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| Now, as many of you know, if you're a parent, as our children get older,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| we need them to come to us and feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| My daughter now doesn't feel as comfortable coming to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| because she thinks she did something wrong by reporting this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| and that I did something wrong by going and speaking up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| My law enforcement officer singled my 10-year-old out in front of her entire class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| Again, I spoke with the principal. I spoke with the sergeant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| I was assured they would take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| I think it is very important that we have these community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| because as has been pointed out, there is so much misinformation coming from the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| and other elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| It's also clear to me that many of you didn't read his resolution when he first wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| And I'm going to end by saying, if my daughter went to school and did not complete her reading assignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| she would be in trouble both by her teacher and by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you, and happy anniversary, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| That concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| Okay, and we have board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| The only thing I want to say is congratulations to the boys' soccer team at Austin East for doing first all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5814)|
| 1:37:00| I've never been a soccer fan, but I am now fully committed to soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| So, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| Beep, beep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| Yes, congratulations to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| Ms. Owen, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| So, you're hooked, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| It's not the new thing, but it feels like the new thing, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Yeah, so I just want to say I went to Bearden's graduation last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| and two things that just stood out to me that I thought, man, that's incredible given in a year like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| So, their class was roughly 525 students, and 125 of those students had a 4.0 or higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| So, 125 out of 525, and 66% of those students out of a class of 525 had a 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5856)|
| 1:37:45| So, you know, we talked a lot about learning loss this year and the impacts of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| and obviously many of that was real for many kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| but it was really inspiring to see kids in specific situations really rise to the occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5872)|
| 1:37:59| and take full advantage of the additional opportunity and innovation that came through the pandemic, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| So, that was an honor to be there, and I really appreciate Ms. Babb being there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| She did a lot of hand-holding and making sure people got to the right spot, and you were great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| I don't know if you even realized it, but you were like, you know, yeah, yeah, it was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| So, and then I just wanted to take a brief second, and it won't take but a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5898)|
| 1:38:23| but I think one other challenge by not using facilitation in this community engagement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| is then every individual meeting that we have ends up becoming its own thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| and there's no consistency or theme to it to really give to the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| and those others who are going to help synthesize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| So, I think for consistency of meeting, that's helpful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| Okay, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| I just want to say I've had a great week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| I got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| Ms. Satterfield and I drove together over to the soccer game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| and I think we both realized we need, like, a course in soccer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| because we don't understand the game except for when we win, and then we totally understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5937)|
| 1:39:02| But I also have been able to go to three graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| I got to go to KAC's graduation, which I have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| if any of y'all can ever go to some of our alternative school graduations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| it really is just so heartwarming to see these kids graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| especially schools like Ridgedale and KAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| We represented, there were six schools, six school districts represented there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| So, those really are all of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5964)|
| 1:39:26| So, that one was great, and then Bearden was great last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| and the weather held out for West this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| and it really, to me, that's what we're all about is graduating these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| So, to me, graduations are long, and I have to say I will give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| we've sort of given Mayor Jacobs a hard time a little bit today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| but Mayor Jacobs and Superintendent, they stand on the stage for every single one of our graduations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5986)|
| 1:39:52| and that's a lot because there are a lot of kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| and I had to thank both of them because I've gone to three, and I've enjoyed three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| Anyway, it's been a really good week, I feel like, for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| Great. Thank you, Ms. Fabb. Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Yes. I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate the two Gibbs teams that made it to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6007)|
| 1:40:23| Carol Mitchell and the softball girls came up a little short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| They were a couple of runs short in the final,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| but Coach Jeff Davis and his boys' baseball team did finish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6036)|
| 1:40:47| and they won the championship, and it's, I think it's, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6047)|
| 1:41:02| He's won it before at least once, maybe more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| I do know he's been to the, since 96, when he became the coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6067)|
| 1:41:13| He's been to the state tournament with a team 40% of the time, so that's pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6073)|
| 1:41:23| He's won over 500 games, and he and Carol both, I don't know how many games she's won,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6083)|
| 1:41:29| but they're both graduates of Gibbs High School when they came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6089)|
| 1:41:36| I think they, I'd like to commend them as well as the kids. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| That's great. Thank you, Mr. McMillan. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| And I know we have state winners for the Farragut High School girls' softball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6105)|
| 1:41:51| so we're very proud of them and for the other teams that traveled to state that maybe didn't do as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| but they competed, and so a lot of fun things going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| So it's nice to end on a happy note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Mr. Jin, we're glad you're here. You have any comments today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6124)|
| 1:42:12| Okay. No, not really. I haven't ever actually, you know, I know these board meetings are all on YouTube,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| and they're two or three hours long. I've never actually sat through an entire one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| but having now done so, you know, it's very interesting to hear all the things that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| all the things that are impacting the students of this county, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| I think if I can give any possible comment, it would be very great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| I'm glad for this opportunity to be able to do this. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Okay. Thank you so much. All right. And we are adjourned. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210602?start=6156)|
