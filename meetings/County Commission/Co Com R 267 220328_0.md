| 0:09:33| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=573)|

| 0:09:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| Do you understand you shall make no beer sales to minors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor or crime involving moral turpitude?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=582)|
| 0:09:56| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| How about any employees at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| It's just me and my sister at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=600)|
| 0:10:06| As I understand it, this location, there was a violation that this body ruled on last month, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| And whose employees were they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Who did that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| My dad previously owned the business, and then since he does not want the business anymore, we ended up, me and my sister ended up buying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=618)|
| 0:10:26| You bought it from him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| While it was under suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| You knew there was a 90-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=630)|
| 0:10:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=632)|
| 0:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| That's something you'll have to deal with this board about as you stand here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| So the question is on number five, has beer ever been sold at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| Your answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| And there is an outstanding license, as I understand it, at that place, license number 1264?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| Is this an application for on, on and off, or off-premises sale of beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| Off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| And who owns the premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| And how long have you owned those, these premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| We're still going through the paperwork right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| So, like, it just, the LLC just got made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| So who owns it now if you're still going through the paperwork?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| I think, the accountant is holding, like, doing most of the stuff, but I think everything is getting transferred over to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| But you can't say who, who's on the list up there in the registrar's office as the owner, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=685)|
| 0:11:31| It should be mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=691)|
| 0:11:42| And here it says, application, who filled out the owners in Morristown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| It should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| That is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Why is it on the application, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| Is that what you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=721)|
| 0:12:08| Is that correct on, from the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=728)|
| 0:12:19| The property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=739)|
| 0:12:29| Ms. Patel, may I clarify, do you own the property or just the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| The business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| I think the issue might have been the address on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| It may be the one for my dad's other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| So I may have mistakenly got the other one, if that makes any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=764)|
| 0:12:56| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Can we also get some clarification on the outline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| When was the previous suspension, how much was that for, and what's the timeline related to that previous suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=783)|
| 0:13:13| I can't remember when we ruled on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=793)|
| 0:13:16| If I may, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| February 22nd was our beer board meeting, and we, at that meeting, we voted for a 90-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=798)|
| 0:13:27| Now, I'll look to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Does that take effect as soon as commission votes on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| So that would expire essentially May 27th or 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| One other question, if you would, for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| Could a license be approved with a timeline to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Could this body say we approve a beer permit of X starting on date X, which would maybe be after the suspension is completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=825)|
| 0:13:55| That's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| I think his board can do what it deems proper in the public interest, and that's about the best advice I can give you, whatever's in the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=837)|
| 0:14:06| What I'm getting at is if we find a new owner, you know, credible to hold a beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| but obviously there is a relationship and a previous violation at the same facility with the same family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| we may choose to make a motion to say we approve your beer permit, but it starts on date X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| which is after the suspension of the previous one ties together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| So we do have the ability to approve it, but say start it on July 1 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| I think I have a question for the law director, and I think we can all see what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| But I have this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| If the gentleman that ran the business before had been saved whenever we landed the 90-day suspension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| and he decided he doesn't want to do business anymore, and he sells it to somebody that's not his daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| what position would we be in then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Are we in any way violating her rights by holding something that her father did against her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=913)|
| 0:15:21| I think that that's something that this board needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| You're asking a hypothetical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| If there were a third person unrelated, which I think is a different factor than what you've got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| you've got to look at these particular facts, and obviously there's a relationship here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| And the policy question which you face is what is in the best interest of the health, welfare, and safety of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=939)|
| 0:15:50| We've seen this try to be done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| I know it bothers this beer board, and it should bother this beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=954)|
| 0:16:01| I can't give you a definitive answer if there were a third party came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| Joe Blow just decides I'm through and moves to California or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| We've got to deal with the facts that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Okay, but you don't see any violation of anyone's civil rights by any action we take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| that might prolong when they could start operating their business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| I see none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| I have an order of Commissioner Schoonmaker, Beeler, and Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| We would also have the option to defer hearing this application to, say, June 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=992)|
| 0:16:41| after the suspension period has expired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| because I think everybody is well aware that this business was probably the most egregious violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| of selling beer to miners in Knox County in a very, very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| So I would be in favor of deferring any action on this until after, say, June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1018)|
| 0:17:10| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| Yeah, I agree wholeheartedly with what Director Booth said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| and I actually did some reading on this particular statute today as it relates to revocation and suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| It's a long statute, and it uses the terms revocation and suspension almost interchangeably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| revocation simply being a permanent form of suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| And in that statute, it says that when there is a revocation of a beer permit for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1056)|
| 0:17:47| that this body essentially could use discretion to issue a new permit to the new owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1067)|
| 0:17:57| unless the individual applying for the new permit is the original holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| or any family member who could potentially inherit the business by airship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| So I think we're on the right track here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| and I'll be prepared to make a motion similar to what was suggested by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1092)|
| 0:18:19| maybe not exactly close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| My question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| If we have a location that has an egregious type situation like what we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| and we say we put the 90-day suspension, is it to the individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| or is it to the place where the action happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| The application is made by the individual, but as you heard Commissioner Buehler read that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1120)|
| 0:18:49| this is a privilege, and this body exercises as best it can in the public interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| and this body is very lenient for the most part on granting beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| But in this particular instance, I believe the facts are as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| They're different than what's normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| It's not just an innocent third party coming in that bought a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| That would be a different set of facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| I just want to make sure you're clear of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| We're doing a lot of dialogue between ourselves to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Does this make sense to you of what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| So far I'm getting as like to wait until the 90-day suspension is over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| Yeah, I guess I just want to make sure that you're clear that this particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| your father's business, I think went through three violations in a really short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| and this board decided to revoke that license for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| And so Commissioner Smith had a valid point of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| does the next person always have to suffer from the first person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| And in the case of its family, to some extent, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| because the law essentially tries to prevent somebody from being a bad actor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| and then just passing it to the next person and the next person and the next person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| and not sort of being responsible for the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| And actually some of that happens in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| People buy and sell businesses all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| But essentially somebody, you know, your family has sort of committed a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| They have to pay for that to some extent in time to not sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| and then you can hit the reset button and start again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| But it is an interesting point Commissioner Smith brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| because let's say perhaps somebody passed away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| and they were a violator of running a terrible business and they passed away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| and you showed up and got inherited a business, would it fall on you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| So the statute that Commissioner Beeler was reading sort of says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| yes, you're tied at the hip for a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| So that's what we're deliberating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| It's just a little in the weeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| and I wanted to make sure you were kind of understanding why we're getting into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| So I hope that helps explain it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| For the record, I'd like to ask Lieutenant Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| have you been back out to the property and is the beer secure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| Yes, and there are signs on the business stating they cannot sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| I want to say it was May 22 that was on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| It's been about a month since I was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| I'd like to look to the District Commissioner for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| I do want to respect the suspension this body enacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| but at the same time I don't want to prolong it beyond what it was stated to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| So if my math is correct, I believe it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| the 90-day suspension would expire on May 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| which is the date of our May beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| So I would offer a motion that we postpone action on this item until the May beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1309)|
| 0:21:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| I have a proper first and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Since we're waiting until May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| would I just go back to the building where I got my beer license stuff to do everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| or do I have to go through all the procedure again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Clerk Bailey will send you an email, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| I think we can clear this up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I mean, if we are just putting off the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| that means that everything you have in place you just show back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| You just show back up for the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Now we're going to move back over to Clerk Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| for consideration of suspension or revocation of beer permits for the following establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| Case 6A is Marathon AJ Highway 1203 Andrew Johnson Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| This is District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| I'll turn it over at this time to Director Buch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| Please state your name for the record, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| My name is Rena Chima.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| Could you bring that mic a little closer to there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| Say again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Rena Chima.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| And how do you represent Marathon on AJ Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| I'm the secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| What I'm going to do here is you've got your name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1402)|

| 0:30:38| and there was an offense in June with an employee who did sell alcohol to an underage individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| and after that happened, Mr. Patel did counsel the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| and implemented some additional training procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| and I believe there was additional signage put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| At that time, I believe there was a point-of-sale system that would have allowed the scanning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| but that was not something that was implemented at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| This time, what happened was actually Mr. Patel himself, who was the one who sold and didn't check the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1862)|
| 0:31:10| The only thing that I will say is I'm a real estate attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| This is not something I do normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| I became involved because he called me panicked at 630 that evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| just beside himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| And the background with that is that Mr. Patel lost his brother earlier that month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| and they had a funeral service here, but then the family returned to India for about 11 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| to take care of the funeral services there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| and they returned about a week before this occurred, and Mr. Patel jumped back into work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| And obviously, with COVID and everything that's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| we know now that that's probably not the best thing to do to push yourself back in when you're grieving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| And he did that, and I guess as business owners, a lot of you would have done the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| I probably would have as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| He wasn't in the best mental condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| He sold alcohol to someone without checking the ID, and that's why we're here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| We have talked about it, and I apologize that it didn't get to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1927)|
| 0:32:10| I do have the remediation plan, if I can pass that forward in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| But Mr. Patel has obviously talked with the staff again and is retraining there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| but the important part, and I believe the gentleman from the pilot also said he has now started scanning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| checking all IDs but also scanning them with the POS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| so there's not going to be the possibility for the error again of not checking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| because the sale isn't going to register unless that ID is scanned and the age is verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| And not only that, before there was an option where you just click OK or just literally click OK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| and then you could just bypass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| Now I figured out you could lock that, and you have to scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| It doesn't go beyond that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| You have to scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| So now if you don't have an ID or whatever, a manager has to overwrite it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| and then that's the only way you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| There's literally no mistakes that can be made unless, I mean, honestly there can't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| Not anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| I don't see a loophole around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Is everything, just as a technicality, everything your attorney said factually true and correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| Yes, everything is correct and true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| I turn it back over to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Thank you, Director Boag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2008)|
| 0:33:32| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| Just a quick question to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| We're on 6C, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| So on here on the computer part, I look at the paper, it says January 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| Is that incorrect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Is it June 28th of 22 or of 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| First offense was June 28th, 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Second offense was January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Okay, because on here it says January 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| And I saw that his beer permit was issued March 5th, so I was like, that's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| And last thing I have to say, this one is on me, completely on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Honestly, if I had an employee working there, that wouldn't have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| They all have been trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Everyone literally took the task force, task class or whatever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| I took it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| I even took several other classes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Top shelf, I think one's for bartender or something like that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| But, I mean, I'm willing to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| I don't care if it's community service or something posting signs out on the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| wherever I am saying whatever I have to do, I'm willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| I'm terribly sorry that I made this mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| I truly am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| But it's been hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| It's been very hard, and I'm honestly sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| And in addition to the remediation plan, I do have documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| I have the death certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I have the plane confirmation and the travel arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| So I wasn't sure how much of that to attach with the remediation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| but I'm certainly happy to pass those out if the board would like to see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2102)|
| 0:35:12| We're going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| Commissioner Schoomaker has his line, and we're going to go to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| And then if you want to set them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| I'll set them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Commissioner Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Obviously, we hold the permit holder to a higher standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| because the beer permit is in your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| Obviously, you realize your mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| and we're fairly sure that that's not going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| So our procedure is, on a second offense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| to give you the option of a 60-day suspension or a $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| So what is your preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| I take the $1,500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion that we assess the $1,500 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| based on the second offense at this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| I have a proper first and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| You'll be getting a letter from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Clerk Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| The next one is Enns Market, 1116 Harvey Road, District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2178)|
| 0:36:26| Director Boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| Is anybody here for that Enns Market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2189)|
| 0:36:35| We'll put that, I guess, Mr. Chairman, to the end in case he walks in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| and then this board can deal with it accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| We're going to move 6D to the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| Clerk Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| The next one is Embassy Suites, 9621 Parkside Drive, District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2208)|
| 0:36:58| Nobody here from Embassy Suites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2218)|
| 0:37:03| I'd suggest, Mr. Chairman, we put that at the end and see if they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| We're going to move 6E to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Clerk Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| Next is Dash and Go, 10636 Hardin Valley Road, District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2235)|
| 0:37:29| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2254)|
| 0:37:35| Could you please state your name, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| My name is Netra Ben Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| And you're here for Dash and Go, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| And what is your position with Dash and Go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| I'm the owner of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| And could you pull that mic a little closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| It's hard to hear you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Sorry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Yes, I'm the owner of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| You've seen what's going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| so I'm going to ask the sheriff to give the allegation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2278)|

| 0:38:54| and we gave an allocation, like, do not come into that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| And also we made changes to your register, like a heart stopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| We have to scan the ID or manually enter it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| So trying to improve and trying not to happen it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2349)|

| 0:43:00| business at 617 Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| selected a six-pack of Coors Light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2583)|

| 0:43:21| that the employee actively went around and didn't follow any of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| safeguards, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2606)|

| 0:45:26| And what's your relationship with Hard Knock's Pizza?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| I'm the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| You've seen what goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| I'm going to ask the sheriff to give the allegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| You don't have a chance to admit or deny and say anything else you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Go ahead, sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| On February 15, 2022, approximately 19.33 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| an underage person working with the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| entered a business at 10847 Harden Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| When they entered the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| the underage person asked a 16-year-old cash register attendant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| standing behind the counter for a beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| handed her his ID, and paid for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| The person that handed them the beer was the person that was cited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| and they were over the age of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| Do you admit or deny the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| We admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Is there anything you'd like to address to the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| He said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Someone checked the ID, and then someone else poured it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| And so we've done retraining and retraining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Whoever physically hands the beer has to recheck, even if the person did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| So we are looking into, with our TOAST system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| some sort of scanning or something to make it kind of simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| you know, as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| But so, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| I'll turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you, Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2803)|

| 0:46:51| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| You've heard the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Would you accept the $1,000 fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Yeah, fine, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| I'd like to say before I make this motion, though, just for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2819)|
| 0:47:04| Hard Knocks is a wonderful, wonderful community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| They are up front with our schools and always meet the needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| So I have absolutely no doubt that this was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| For sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| And I'm sure that you have taken care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| Yeah, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| I would like to make a motion that we accept the $1,000 fine on this first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| Have a proper first and second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2860)|
| 0:47:41| Clark will send you a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2863)|
| 0:47:44| What address are you sending it to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| If it goes to the store, that would be awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| 1504.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2876)|

| 0:48:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| At this time, I'd like to move back to 6D, which is Ian's Market at 1116 Harvey Road, District 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| Ian's Market here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2897)|
| 0:48:24| As a clarification, did we send anything out or is it stipulated in when you cite them that what day they're supposed to appear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2904)|
| 0:48:37| I'm sorry, we cannot hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| They get an agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| I could add on that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| I believe it's the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| The unit that I run for the sheriff's office on a day-to-day basis has encountered the owner of this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| He's part of an LLC that we purchase narcotics from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| and they have been previously fined by TABC for selling liquor not permitted inside the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| I'm not saying he has done anything incorrect with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| He doesn't run the business on the day-to-day, but I want that on the record that we have encountered this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you, Lieutenant Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| Just a quick question to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| So how, if they don't have a liquor license, because they only sell beer in that store, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| He has a partnership that has a liquor store off of Rudy Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2966)|
| 0:49:32| Oh, got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2972)|
| 0:49:36| It's discretion of this body, as Director Boot says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| for us to move in specific directions of whether we defer this for another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2979)|
| 0:49:45| Or, Director Boot, do you think that it would be best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2985)|
| 0:49:49| I think an abundance of caution under due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| Make sure, defer it 30 days and make sure he gets notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| We don't want somebody coming in saying, well, you sent it to the wrong address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| So if we could accomplish that, and however you want to do it, if the Sheriff could deliver it personally, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3002)|
| 0:50:09| I'm good with the extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| I think he's a good person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| I just think he hires some bad characters occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| We want to give him his day before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| At this time, I'd like to look to the District Commissioner, Commissioner Schoonmaker, to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| I'll be happy to make a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3031)|

| 0:50:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Next, I'm going to call on 6E, which is Embassy Suites, 9621 Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3034)|
| 0:50:40| Embassy Suites, 9621 Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3040)|
| 0:50:47| Lieutenant Lawson, do you have anything in your file on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| No, and I can't remember if it was them or the gentleman from Langley Place that contacted us, Ms. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| Was it Langley Place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I do not have anything on them, but we can go by tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| and make sure they're aware to be here for the next setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3064)|
| 0:51:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3069)|
| 0:51:10| Given the discretion that—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Was this the same kind of scenario where they went to the little snack bar area, grabbed a beer, came up to the desk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| The Embassy actually has a full bar and restaurant inside, so they just went up to the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| Given the discretion from Director Boote that he gave us on 6D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| Director Boote, do you feel that it is fine to defer for 30 days or what's the direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| I do, and we want to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| Embassy Suites has evidently been a good partner in our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| so we want to make sure they get their day in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3107)|
| 0:51:48| At this time, I'd like to look to District 3 Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3108)|
| 0:51:54| I'd like to make the motion we postpone this for to our next Airborne meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| A proper first and a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| We're at the end of the meeting, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Yeah, we're on to other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Lieutenant Lawson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| We had nine violations in this timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| How long was this timeframe and how many businesses did you check?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| We actually conducted three sales fairly close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| Ms. Daley and I had an email mishap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3155)|
| 0:52:38| and that's why there were more on this agenda than the previous one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3158)|
| 0:52:44| It looks like on the 15th we visited approximately 18 businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| and on the 31st of January we visited almost 30 businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| So about 50 businesses on those two dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| Do you have all the ñ about a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| you didn't have all the resources that your team needed to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| I think we've remedied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Do you have all the resources you need going into the summer season to keep the foot on the pedal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| and make sure that we have businesses that are in compliance and we're obeying the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Lieutenant Lawson, I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Is there any public record that shows the businesses that passed the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| I provided to Ms. Daley and I provided to the Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| I know Karen Pershing with Metro Drug does send out letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| but there's no, I guess, database they can search of where we've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| unless the commission would like to put that out on their web page or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| Yeah, I think I see where you're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| I think it wouldn't be a bad idea to add it to our agenda just as a spreader record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| It would be nice to show who passed and said to show that we do have good companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| and I think it could just be an agenda item that's a spreader record that just shows, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| if those are monthly, if that can be part of the rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| And I can provide these two dates right now if that's something the commission would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| Commissioner Scalia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| Kind of playing off Chairman Jay's suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| what if we posted on our commission website the good guys and the bad guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3272)|
| 0:54:38| In other words, list the businesses, because it is public record that X, Y, Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| Minimart had a, you know, $1,000 fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| and then also list all the properties that followed the bare laws of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| I'm good with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| I think, like Commissioner Jay said, reading it in a spreader record so it's actually in the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| so people know, you know, and then having it on the website as well, that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| This is other business, so that's something that I can try to work with Clerk Daly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| and I'll probably have to work with Drew to get that on by then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| and then Lieutenant Lawson to have them up hopefully by next meeting if we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| I can e-mail them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| I've got them all saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| I can e-mail them to Ms. Daly and the commission and make sure you all have copies of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| I'll talk with Director Webb with IT as well, see how quick he can have that turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Do we have any other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| I'd just like to say thank you to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| I know this has been a big beer board and a big agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| so thank you guys for coming early and treasuring through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| Have a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3356)|

| 0:56:40| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Commissioner Biggs, would you please offer our devotional for this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| I take pride in this tonight, probably guessing this will be my last devotional before Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3407)|
| 0:56:56| So I wanted to do something special to me, and I hope you guys give me a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| I wanted to tell you guys a little bit about my father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| My dad and my mother had been married for quite some time, and 1983 was the year that I was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| My mother was pregnant with me, and she started to go to church and ask my dad several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| And finally my father went and felt some movement in his heart and didn't really understand everything that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| But at that time, my dad was working metro narcotics at the MLB building on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| And my father told my mom on a Wednesday morning in the spring that he would go to church with her that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3447)|

| 0:57:37| My father pulled out of the MLB building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| I'm sure Sarah Spangler can remember where that's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| My father and he worked together at that current time to take a ride on Western Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| almost diagonally across the street from the MLB building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| It was a car that met the specifications of something wanted by the FBI, and the man driving it did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3469)|
| 0:57:55| And my dad looked at that car, and he thought, I should pull him over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| But he didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| He went home to get his wife and daughter, and they all went to church that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| The next day, nothing crazy happened at church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| but my father come to find out that that man went right up the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| and ended up in a high-speed police chase by some state troopers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and whenever he came out of the car, it was a vicious firefight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Guns a-blazing, shots fired, and luckily nobody was injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| But I say all that to say this, he was apprehended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| But if my father would have pulled that man over that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| more than likely that man would have shot my dad dead right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| and I never would have got a chance to meet him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| never would have got a chance to be molded into the man that I am today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| And my dad went on to find the Lord and to lead hundreds of people in prison to Jesus Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3531)|
| 0:59:00| and for that I'm very grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| So I say all that to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| Sometimes you don't understand what's going on or the path that you're on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| or what's happening at the current moment, and I'm not here to preach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| That's Commissioner Beeler. He does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3553)|
| 0:59:16| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Having God in your heart is one of the most important things that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and this being my last devotion, I just wanted to share that message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3563)|
| 0:59:26| because that's one of the most impressive testimonies that I've ever heard of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3566)|
| 0:59:31| and it being my dad, I felt like it was good not to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| If you would all bow your heads with me and let's say a quick prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3574)|

| 1:06:39| Item number 31 is presentation to recognize the Correction Officer of the Year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=3999)|
| 1:06:44| by Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4008)|
| 1:07:01| Welcome, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| Tom Spangler, Knox County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| Thank you, Commission, for giving me this time again today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| to recognize somebody within our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| Today, we're recognizing Officer Frye, who is one of our correctional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| But what he did was actually away from the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| And we think it's recognizable because during the nomination process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| his peers are the ones who voted for him for Officer of the Month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| which was back in August of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4054)|
| 1:07:38| And with that being said, then he was also nominated as Officer of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| And I will paraphrase what it was that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| He'd just gotten off work, second shift, at the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| and was on his way home with another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| And they noticed a vehicle that was swerving back and forth on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| They pulled into the Wigles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| They noticed that the driver got out of the vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| and proceeded to go to the passenger side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| and yank a female out of the vehicle and started assaulting her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| The officers intervened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| Officer Frye intervened at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| The individual got back into the truck and tried to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4095)|
| 1:08:21| Officer Frye tried to bust the driver's side window out and was unsuccessful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| but was able to at least get the attention of the driver to stop and open the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| And at that point, Officer Frye reached in, was able to put it in park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| take the keys from the individual, and called for our patrol officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| The reason I'm saying this is this is an officer who does not have the patrol training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| but took matters into his own hands to make sure that an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| within our community was not injured in any further way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| With that being said, that is why his peers and his supervisors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| along with Chief William Purvis here, he is over our Corrections Division,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| that I want to recognize in front of you and all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| our Correctional Officer of the Year, Officer Frye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4150)|
| 1:09:23| Commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| I think that you know that not only where they are assigned to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| that it could be just about anything that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| So I want to thank each of you all, commissioners, for allowing me the time to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Congratulations, Officer Frye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Item number 32 is presentation of Rural Metro Monthly Report by Jeff Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4182)|
| 1:09:49| Welcome, Captain Bagwell, as always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, Jeff Bagwell, 160 North Campbell Station Road in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| The monthly report for Rural Metro for the month of February looks like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| 777 first responder calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| Sounds like we're talking about an airplane, not number of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| 69 car crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| 46 residential structure fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| 75 false alarms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| 20 hazardous material incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| 267 lift assist or envelope assist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| And 202 car fires or brush fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| And those have been up drastically in the last three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| For a total of 1,456 for the month of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| We responded to properties valued at $2.248 million and had a property loss of $964,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| which means we saved an average of about 59% of the valued property with an average response time of five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| and almost 60% of the reported fires were contained to the room of origin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| Station 30 and Halls, yes, continues to be the busiest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| but Farragut has dropped out a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| It's now Powell, so Commissioner Buster has both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| The North Battalion is still the busiest with 542 calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| and the busiest time of the month is between 11 a.m. and noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4271)|
| 1:11:15| Through our partnership with Knox County, we added two new educational videos to the YouTube library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| We had 287,720 views for the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| representing 12,000 hours of program time and logging 2.7 million impressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| We also added 338 new subscribers to the YouTube channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| In addition, we had eight in-person events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Total contacts via all conduits was approximately 288,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| Last month, I gave you a somewhat negative but very transparent report of how your fire department was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4304)|
| 1:11:51| This month, I'll try to be more positive with what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| Our new 107-foot, $1.1 million ladder truck is in the paint booth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4315)|
| 1:12:01| expected to be here sometime later this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| The new pumper has been ordered with the specifications approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| Delivery for the pumper is early 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| That tells you how long it takes to get a fire truck built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4332)|
| 1:12:16| We talked last month about the 24 new firefighters that are currently in the fire academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| They'll be complete sometime later this summer and on the fire trucks in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| Plans are underway to recruit more industrial customers, working with the Chamber of Commerce and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| trying to get more of the industrial support from our industrial partners in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4352)|
| 1:12:40| Insurance Services Organization, or the ISO, which works for the insurance industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| uses the largest buildings to measure the needs of the fire department within a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4366)|
| 1:12:52| Therefore, those very taxpayers have to be supporters of a subscription or a membership fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4372)|
| 1:13:00| If they weren't in the grading process with ISO, we would have no need for million-dollar ladder trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| and we would go back to having pumpers and water tenders to protect residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| We anticipate this being – oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| We're also working to finalize a fire department app that you can download on your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| Everybody's using apps now, so the fire department will have an app that you can go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| and we think that that will be a conduit that we can communicate with not only the folks of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| but beyond that as well, and be an avenue to get to our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| We're working with our Knox Metro Firefighters Association to improve benefits to our personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| that staff our two fire medic units in Farragut and in Gibbs to retain our quality MTs and paramedics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4419)|
| 1:13:47| In these times, it's tough to retain employees, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| It doesn't matter what industry you're in, and we're looking for every possible avenue to keep those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| that we have already made sizable investments in to train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| That's it for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| I'll entertain any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Vice Chairman Biggs, I believe your light is on, and Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| I'll go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Of the 20 HAZMAT calls, how many of those were at the Watt Road Way Station, or if any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| There are several out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Probably every month there's at least two to five that are out in that part of the town, that part of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4461)|
| 1:14:30| Vice Chairman Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4471)|
| 1:14:33| Director Bagwell, hearing everything that you're talking about with YouTube channels and the apps and how everything's driven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4473)|
| 1:14:38| do we have any curriculum that we share in Knox County Schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| So whenever we do that, what does that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| Is that a helmet maneuver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| Is that diabetic safety if someone's going in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Knox County, through our partnership with the Fire Bureau, we've created a lot of videos that the schools can access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| We did that a lot during COVID to be able to try to still get the fire prevention method out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| and getting kids to understand dialing 911 and what it's for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| Since we're kind of coming out of that this spring, we've actually, and even last fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| we've done a lot more hands-on in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| So we've not done as much of that with the schools as what we did, but it's still out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| Do you have the ability to certify people in the schools whenever they do learn how to give the helmet maneuver and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4522)|
| 1:15:30| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| You can't do it through a video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| The Red Cross and the Heart Association won't let you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| But, yeah, we have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| I'm not sure who does it through the school system, but we would certainly help them if they needed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| See no other likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| Thank you, Mr. Bagwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| As always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Item number 33, presentation of Knox County Annual Mental Health Report by Ben Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4552)|
| 1:16:01| Welcome, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Just state your name and address for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| You have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| My name is Ben Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| I'm the executive director of the Mental Health Association of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| My address is 10126 Longford Drive, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4575)|
| 1:16:21| So I want to thank you all for the opportunity to be here to present what is the first state of mental health report for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4581)|
| 1:16:31| And I need to thank the commissioners and Mayor Jacobs for asking the Mental Health Association to prepare this report so we can get a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4591)|
| 1:16:44| understanding of where we are, what we have in our community, what we don't have in our community, and certainly what we need or think we need moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4604)|
| 1:16:56| Now, I need to tell you that our system is very good, but it is not without challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| And there are some areas of our system that are shining brightly, doing a great job, and then there's some other areas where we do need to work to make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4623)|
| 1:17:15| And with your support and the mayor's support and others, our stakeholders, et cetera, I think we can get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4635)|
| 1:17:24| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| So our process was to conduct a key informant survey, and we started doing that in late September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4646)|
| 1:17:37| And from there, we moved into key informant interviews where we actually made appointments to visit with a number of stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4657)|
| 1:17:46| And here's a short list of some of those entities that we worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| So the challenges we have in our mental health system are that the number of people actually needing mental health care has grown dramatically in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4674)|
| 1:18:08| And I know you all are very much aware of what's happened with COVID, but when you look at what happened with COVID with surges of the COVID virus in our community and across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4688)|
| 1:18:21| there was a parallel surge upwards of numbers of people experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4701)|
| 1:18:29| But when COVID turned downwards, there was no similar turn downwards of mental health problems in our communities all across the country and particularly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4709)|
| 1:18:41| So what you have is symptoms started to develop, symptoms returned, symptoms became much more long-lasting, more acute, and thus they did not turn downwards or mitigate at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4721)|
| 1:18:56| And that's a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| So that comes at a time that's not very good for our mental health system, and I'll explain that on the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4738)|
| 1:19:07| So our mental health system has a couple of different sectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| There's a public sector, which is where we have places like McNabb Center and Cherokee Health System and Peninsula Health, and they are great partners in that sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4751)|
| 1:19:24| Our problem is, of course, that they are challenged to serve people who are needing services in Medicaid, Medicare, and uninsured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4764)|
| 1:19:33| And at the same time, we are operating under a federal designation of a mental health professional workplace shortage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4773)|
| 1:19:42| That's kind of federal gobbledygook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| That means poor people can't access care in the time that they need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| And so that's a huge problem for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| The other problem that we have in the public sector is that the clinical staff turnover at these partners has more than doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4792)|
| 1:20:01| And that is a distinct problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| When you have an increase in demand for services and you have less clinical staff available, that means the time from entry to the time to get your very first appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4804)|
| 1:20:15| or to see a doctor to get a prescription is going to be stretched out like a rubber band.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| It's going to take longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| And so that becomes problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| The public sector is not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| There is something called the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| And the private sector is where most of us would receive health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| And that is through private practicing doctors' offices and clinics, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| There are private practicing mental health professionals in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| And while this slide might indicate that we have a lot of mental health professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| we actually have over 1,700 mental health professionals in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| That slide is very deceiving because we do have a lot of people with licenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| but we have very few that are actually taking a new client today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| And, in fact, our work looked at this in a big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| And with Commissioner Jay's recommendation, we dug real hard to find out how many were taking a new client today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| And we can tell you that less than 10% of our professionals will take a new patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| And so that is a problem that screams to access issues for those on commercial insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| or employer-provided insurance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| So two key points regarding access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4890)|
| 1:21:33| Those who are poor have trouble accessing the care they need in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4893)|
| 1:21:38| Those who have insurance are going to have trouble, difficulties accessing care as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| So next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| There are a couple of special populations that I would be remiss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| if I did not point to also having challenges with access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| I don't know if you're aware of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| but we have very, very few mental health professionals who are black mental health professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4918)|
| 1:22:06| That's a psychiatrist, a nurse, a social worker, counselor, psychologist, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4926)|
| 1:22:12| And we have even fewer that speak Spanish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| So what this means is for persons of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| their ability to access culturally competent or linguistically appropriate care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| is even more compromised because we have so few people available to help provide that care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| And all of this was something that rose to the surface, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| with all the violence around young people enrolled at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| You know, we had a traumatized community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| and we had very little capacity to really support that community with persons of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| providing that level of mental health intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| And so that was problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| Another area that I need to tell you about is children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4974)|
| 1:22:59| And I tell you this because I'm a dad, and I have two kids, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| and mental illness actually starts in kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4986)|
| 1:23:10| Fifty percent of all people with a mental health issue will have their symptoms start by age 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| and then kids actually wait the longest period of time from start of symptom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| to when they enter a front door at a treatment provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| And so it means we need to be doing a whole lot to intervene earlier upstream with kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| so that we don't end up with a young person becoming an impaired adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| because we've not intervened early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| So we have problems with kids accessing care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| Parents call us at the Mental Health Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| and they tell us a sad story that they can't find a place to take their child to get therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| or they can't find a doctor to prescribe medications that their child might need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5031)|
| 1:23:57| whether it's for attention deficit or depression or anxiety, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5037)|
| 1:24:02| And so Knox County, sadly, has actually been labeled a child psychiatry desert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| and that means we've got problems for families to get their children access to mental health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| And one of the indicators that we need to point to that would be helpful is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5055)|
| 1:24:22| we need more mental health care available at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| Now, Knox County Schools is a tremendous partner of the Mental Health Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| and they've made significant strides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| It used to be 20 years ago they had five or six counselors that rotated amongst all the middle and high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5074)|
| 1:24:42| and they now have a total of 33 counselors or social workers under a contract with McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| So there's one at each middle and high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| So they've made significant progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| But the ratio I want to tell you about, the best, the gold standard, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5095)|
| 1:25:02| is one counselor per 250 kids in a school building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| So we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Right now we're at one counselor or social worker per school building in middles and high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| and we need to try to raise that ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| So that means if a school has 1,000 kids, we need to have four mental health professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| to provide mental health therapy in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| That's not advising a young person on what courses to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| It is providing counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| So we need to try to get to that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| So all of this I tell you about because this is kind of the perfect storm that the commission asked us to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| and the mayor asked us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| And my job is to be brutally honest with you, to tell you the good, but also tell you what are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5148)|
| 1:25:55| So this is a perfect storm that we're looking at here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| If you would, next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| Crisis services is one of our really bright spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| We're doing well here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| We have crisis services provided by McNabb Center and 911, and mobile crisis is provided by McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5168)|
| 1:26:17| They effectively divert over 6,300 people away from hospitalization that don't need hospital care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5177)|
| 1:26:25| They're able to get them into a walk-in clinic, which is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| They also operate something called the Crisis Stabilization Unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| and before we established the Crisis Stabilization Unit in the mid-2000s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| those 300 residents would have been hospitalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| And so they have a great program that's able to divert people into less restrictive care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5202)|
| 1:26:48| so that they can avoid being placed in a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| Now, something good has happened this past fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| McNabb Center has raised the resources to open a children's and family crisis walk-in center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5216)|
| 1:27:04| and it opened in the fall, and that means children have same-day access to crisis care now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5224)|
| 1:27:11| which is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| And also very soon to open here in 2022 is a children's crisis stabilization unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| which if you've heard stories, you might have heard of some children having to wait at children's hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| for days before they could get a bed in Nashville or even Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| And so those days are going to change because we are going to be able to open this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| children's crisis stabilization unit, so that is incredibly positive too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| So I know some of you were here when Lakeshore closed in 2011 to 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5261)|
| 1:27:51| and when Lakeshore closed, that took away a number of beds that we had in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5271)|
| 1:27:57| and then Tenova closed their beds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| So we've been suffering for some time without hospital beds in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| and I can tell you that the suffering has about come to an end, which is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| So we have two hospitals about to open off of the Middlebrook Pike area here this spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5292)|
| 1:28:19| and both are private hospitals, and so that means they're for-profit hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| but they're both opening, one in April and one in May, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| and we'll end up with about 190 beds, so that will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| But it doesn't exactly fix one of the problems that our medical-surgical hospitals are experiencing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| and that is for a number of years now we've had 8,500 patients entering the emergency rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5322)|
| 1:28:51| and they've been entering the emergency rooms for mental health care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| but they did not need emergency-level care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| So these are not patients that had attempted suicide or ingested something, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| These are folks that are entering the emergency room for what we call urgent care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| They needed a prescription.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| So we've got a problem there that we hope to resolve soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| with a psychiatric emergency room concept to move people away from a med-surg hospital emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5359)|
| 1:29:28| free up that space so those hospitals can treat patients with other injuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| but also get those people access to more immediate mental health care, get a prescription,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| maybe connect them to therapy, that sort of thing, in a more timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| It's really important because that's costing the medical-surgical hospitals about $23 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| in admissions to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| So criminal justice and mental health is another area where we're doing really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| The Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center is a facility that County Commission proudly supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| its construction and opening of a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| and I think it was about four years ago in March of 2018 that it opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| And the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center actually diverts residents of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| who have committed nine very low-level offenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| and I know you cannot read those that are up there on that slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5427)|
| 1:30:32| but nine very low-level offenses that otherwise would have sent them to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| And they are able to divert people into the Behavioral Health Urgent Care Center, or BUC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5438)|
| 1:30:44| and they're able to start mental health treatment or addiction treatment right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| And that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Ninety-seven percent are diverted away from jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| Only about 22% of the BUC clients throughout the year ever return back to the BUC with another offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5453)|
| 1:31:05| So that's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| So we're really pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| Now, there is also something that operates, and a number of Knoxville residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5469)|
| 1:31:17| Knox County residents enter, and it's called a co-responder unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| which is operated by KPD and McNabb Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| And so when 911 gets a call, they might get a mental health call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5485)|
| 1:31:32| and they dispatch the co-responder unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| And so the KPD team and a McNabb therapist respond to that call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5494)|
| 1:31:40| So instead of arresting somebody, they start that person in mental health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| and divert that person away from the jail and an arrest for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5505)|
| 1:31:54| And so it's very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| Ninety-eight percent of folks are diverted from getting arrested, which is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| Now, the success of that unit makes me, as a citizen of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| and as an advocate and your advocate here in this process, to ask a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5525)|
| 1:32:11| Should Knox County Sheriff's Office also have a similar unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| Because mental health problems don't just exist in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| They exist throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| And so I think the Sheriff's Office could have a similar unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5545)|
| 1:32:30| and have similar success if given the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| So that concludes one more slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5555)|
| 1:32:42| So there's one other thing I would like to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| There's been conversation about the need for some specialty courts, a mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| We're the only large county in the state that does not have a mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| So it would be nice to have one, but I stand right shoulder to shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| with Attorney General Charm-Allen on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| She would love to have a mental health court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| but you've got to have the mental health resources in place for that court to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| And what that means is the judge just can't say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| here I am, I'm going to take these cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and I'm going to order folks out into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| She needs to have resources attached to the court that will wrap around that person involved with the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| so that they can get very intensive case-managed services moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| to make sure that client goes to where they're supposed to go for treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5613)|
| 1:33:39| stays engaged in that treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| and then completes the multiple report-back process to the court to show, here I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5621)|
| 1:33:48| I'm now walking a fine line, I'm being good, I'm doing what I'm supposed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| and I'm ready to complete the terms of this court order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5633)|
| 1:33:58| And so we need to continue to look at those opportunities for specialty courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| and there's even some folks that are interested in creating a special homeless court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| which would do similar work to a mental health court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| So with that, I am ready to turn it over and answer any questions that any county commissioners might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5652)|
| 1:34:19| Thank you very much, Mr. Harrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| I'll look to Commissioner Jay first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you, Mr. Harrington, for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| This has been a long road in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| I know our commission, we talked about this almost a year ago in the initial phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| funded this work in late summer, you sort of started it in early fall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| and I say that to say this is really just the tip of the iceberg, but it's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5682)|
| 1:34:49| And we recently met, I just wanted to let the commissioners know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| we recently met with the mayor and his team and our health department to sort of talk about discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| about what do we do now and how does this move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| how does it get connected to our resources within the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| and what kind of work can this turn into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| Much like we experienced this month with our housing report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| this is something I would love to see on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5713)|
| 1:35:18| You'll notice in your packet there's a great summary sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| but more importantly in the back of the packet are some very specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| of things that we can take action on, we can support as a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5727)|
| 1:35:31| and I hope that you all find value in this as you absorb it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| and that we can find ways to support this happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| If you can't measure it, you can't manage it, and if you never manage it, you can't get ahead of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| And I hope year after year after year we can look at this with the team from the Mental Health Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| with our health department, with our leadership, and find ways to just start moving the needle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| I mean, this is a massive, massive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| This is a massive issue, but we have a mayor and an administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| who is clearly focused on mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| We have new resources coming on that we've approved with our hospital and other care centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5765)|
| 1:36:12| I think it's a great start, and I just want to thank all the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| for supporting the work last summer and hopefully supporting it going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| I just have one question, then I'll turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| When we started this project, the very first slide you show were a whole bunch of partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5783)|

| 1:36:32| They might have attended some meetings, but they didn't really work in a cohesive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| When your group was selected to be almost Switzerland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| but a subject matter expert Switzerland, to be able to go in and start working with all those partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5803)|
| 1:36:51| what was their response, and what do you see their participation going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| Because change is hard, and turf wars are hard, and this subject is hard on top of the other two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| I think that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| We didn't meet any resistance from any of the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| They understood our role because that's been our historic role since 1948,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| and many of those organizations have known me for my 28 years as CEO of the MHA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5834)|
| 1:37:22| and they've seen us live that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| We live it when we get calls to the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| They are looking for a referral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| We don't give out one provider name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| We give out multiple so they know we're going to be that neutral entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5852)|
| 1:37:37| and we understand some of the issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| and so we can then dialogue with them about the challenges that they've got and what they're facing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| what they really need to be able to make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| So there was lots of support moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| and I think folks are ready and willing to engage on all those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| if, of course, this legislative body and the mayor wants to move forward doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| Thank you, Mr. Harrington. Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| Commissioners, please mark May the 9th, if you haven't already, on your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5883)|
| 1:38:09| Councilman Roberto about a month ago reached out to Senator Massey and to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| and I think maybe to several of you with the idea of doing a joint workshop with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5894)|
| 1:38:19| and City Council and the legislative delegation on mental health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| and I saw him Wednesday, and that date has been secured, May the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| I'll be working with Councilman Roberto on getting an agenda set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5911)|
| 1:38:36| getting some presentations set for that date, so it should be a really productive time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| Any further questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| Thank you again, Mr. Harrington. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| This brings us to our first segment of public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| and we do have one person who has signed up to speak, and that is Mr. Mike Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5931)|
| 1:39:00| Welcome again, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| If you'll just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| Normally we have five minutes for our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| I won't hold your feet to the fire too much on that, but for me you'll give me five seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| I'll give you 5.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Okay, sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Mike Odom, Knoxville Chamber, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| I just wanted to come up and say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| Last meeting you all heard a report, it was referenced earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| about the housing that the Knoxville Area Association of Realtors presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| and there's one big piece of this that we really wanted to kind of bring to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| It talked about that now to get a new home in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| your salary must be about $81,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| That is 50% more than our average annual pay is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5990)|
| 1:39:55| So we're at $54,000 a year, and to get a new home, according to their research, is $81,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=5995)|
| 1:40:02| So it's exactly 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| That makes it very difficult for us to continue to bring people to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| to fill the jobs we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| As we know, we've talked to you every other month about our unemployment rate being below 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| If you're at 4%, you're pretty much at full employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| So we're about a point and a half below that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| We really need to find different solutions so that we can get more housing out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| so that we can get the folks that are filling these jobs places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| And that's across the spectrum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| People talk about affordable housing, and that meets many definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| It could be someone who is on the lower side of our socioeconomic spectrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| but it could be in the middle as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| We need all of those for us to be successful so we can continue to thrive and make this community great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| So I just wanted to bring that up, Commissioner. I appreciate the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| Thank you, as always, Mr. Odom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6054)|

| 1:44:47| Are we re-utilizing school building properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| Chair recognizes Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| We had a discussion a long time ago with Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| and we had a public hearing in private together that we had too many schools in Knoxville at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| I think we had almost 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| I think we have, what, 92 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Mr. Chairman, it's hard to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Can you pull a little closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Can you hear me better now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| We had discussions with Superintendent Thomas and some other people about the number of schools that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6322)|
| 1:45:28| and I think we have 92 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6328)|
| 1:45:32| I'm not sure, but I think that's about the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| And so I went through and looking at all these things and been thinking about the schools we do have in the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| And we build new schools, but we're building schools on the same order we built 50, 60 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6341)|
| 1:45:50| And so I started looking into what you do with the buildings that you do have and where you revitalize them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| and then when you build new buildings, what the new buildings should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| And I'm not an expert on this, but a couple of things came to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6360)|
| 1:46:07| Why aren't we doing these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| You know, we have security problems in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| and some of the newer schools have just one hallway that goes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6373)|
| 1:46:19| and not rooms on the other side but just rooms on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| That way you can see down the hallways, there's no crooks and crevices that people can hide in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| and do things that happen in other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| There's all these new things that they're coming up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| And my situation is, or my thoughts were, we have schools that we need certain types of education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6394)|
| 1:46:45| and we move away from those schools and we let them sit there and we let them deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| The building's already there and you can remodel them to handle some of the education that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6410)|
| 1:46:56| Some of the things that we do need are, you know, these, I call them shop schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6416)|
| 1:47:03| or whatever you want to call them, these educational things in HVAC and all like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| that we have buildings that we have all across the county that we could have used in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| but we did them for, did other things, usage with them that the schools already had that we could put things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6431)|
| 1:47:18| So my question is this, when we move forward, how do we get with the schools and the schools with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| to, how do we develop new buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| What kind of buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| And one, I think I read this thing and I'm, hopefully I've understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6450)|
| 1:47:38| It was a roads design school that talked about designing buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6458)|
| 1:47:44| They talked about redeveloping a school, and when you first redevelop a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6464)|
| 1:47:49| the school itself, not all the schools, but the school itself must have a mission statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6469)|
| 1:47:56| And you have to choose the education model that you're going to use there very wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| And how do you do modern assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| That's number three, and four was adopting technology integration into education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| Are we doing that properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| I'm not an educator, but I thought that was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| And it says modern classrooms and campus designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| We still make four walls out of bricks and mortar and this other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6501)|
| 1:48:26| and I saw all these other new school designs that they had, and they had like courtyards in between the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6506)|
| 1:48:32| And some campuses had different buildings for different subjects, like for science in one building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| and you had math in one building, and then you had, you know, all the other kinds of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6518)|
| 1:48:46| what we do, what we do our rigors in in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| But they were separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| And one of the things they said about having buildings like that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| if there happened to be one teacher that was out in that particular school for sickness or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| there was another teacher in the building that could take over that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| that was educated in that same part of curriculum that the teacher was out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| So you could replace a teacher with a teacher that if, say, for a math teacher was out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| you could replace him with another math teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| And you integrate future work skills into your education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| Now I'm talking about high schools, and in the high school, the big thing that they had was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| they had like sophomore, junior, senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Then they had a separate high school for freshmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6574)|
| 1:49:40| But the other schools that we have, like we have middle schools, intermediate schools, all these other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6580)|
| 1:49:45| but some of the other things that they're going to in some of these other areas is like a grammar school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| which is like from kindergarten all the way through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| And they say what you can do is you can condense your assets, which is your teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6594)|
| 1:50:03| You don't have to have big classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| You have smaller classrooms, but you have more teachers there that can add to the curriculum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6606)|
| 1:50:13| a much wider range of things that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| My question to the school system is what processes do we go through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| We just got through doing the Adrian Burnett School, and I was reading that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| and I know it was too late then, but we did a regular school, brick and mortar, square rooms, square halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| and nothing we thought about protection for the young people that are in that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| And they talk about making sure that there's a lot of natural light coming into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6638)|
| 1:50:46| One of the worst things we have is during the wintertime we have less sunshine at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| and then you have people that have problems with the lack of sunshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| What can we do in those education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| My question to the school system is do we go through these processes when we're going through these things now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6657)|
| 1:51:05| And I don't know, and I'm just asking you, Superintendent Thomas, if you want to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| And do we take these things down? Do we sit down when we're doing a new school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| Are we doing a new mission statement form?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| Are we doing a model, choosing an educational model for that particular school, for that particular community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| Because different communities need different models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| What are we doing in those situations like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| And when we move away from a school, do we have any plans for it that can be utilized in furthering the young people's education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6691)|
| 1:51:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| Bob Thomas, Superintendent, Knox County Schools, 400 West Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| New address, and thank you for your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| We certainly like our accommodations there at the UT Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| We appreciate all the work that went into that, so thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| I think the short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Let me talk about that just a little bit, and Russ can talk about it a lot better than...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| Where are you, Russ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Okay, Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| But we have program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Years ago, we developed program standards, program standards for elementary schools, middle schools, high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| Those were board approved, and certainly we'll be glad to get you that information on the program standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| but looking at the square footage and everything for rooms from elementary schools, middle schools, high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| So we follow the architecture given those program standards, and the building is designed based on those program standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6748)|
| 1:52:35| It also includes security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| I know a good example, Gibbs Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| You can stand in one hallway and actually kind of look three or four directions all the way to the end of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| So we do try to take into consideration security measures and cameras and so forth that we put into the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6767)|
| 1:52:54| and in terms of our high schools, we've got a couple of schools that use the academy model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| like Fulton High School and Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6779)|
| 1:53:02| Most, and my teaching days go way back, but I know at Bearden High School, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| when there was a math wing, a social studies wing, language arts wing, science wing, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6788)|
| 1:53:15| So we do group classrooms together in terms of the subject matter that's taught.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| So I think, not saying that we couldn't do a better job, and I know we continuously look at design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| We haven't built a high school since Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| Getting ready to, if the capital plan is improved, getting ready to add on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| But again, it was built, we try to build schools so that they can be added on to accommodate the additional enrollment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6817)|
| 1:53:44| that might be projected and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| But I'll let Russ, if you want to add to what I've said, Russ, in terms of program standards and design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6826)|
| 1:53:53| I'll let you have a mic here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| Thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| I think just one thing I'd like to elaborate on that the superintendent talked about and you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6840)|
| 1:54:08| We subscribe to a program called Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| It's referred to as CEPTEDS, and when we engage an architect to develop a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| we expect them to apply those principles to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| And you can look at the schools that we're designing today, and the superintendent mentioned Gibbs Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| and the ability to observe basically every hallway in the school using only two or three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| That's physical observation, not just video cameras.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6878)|
| 1:54:42| But there are other elements that are obvious to folks when they look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| and it's not just traffic flow in the building, it's how we get people into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| And I think all of y'all have looked at all of the schools that we've done recently where we have a secure vestibule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6893)|
| 1:55:00| and we bring people in and try to control the entrance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| And when you look at the hallways, too, if you look at some of our older schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6904)|
| 1:55:09| the way they're designed is every door into a classroom has a nook in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6909)|
| 1:55:15| so that when you open the door, it doesn't open out into the hallway to impede traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| Well, every time you do that, that gives you a covered and concealed position for somebody to work from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6920)|
| 1:55:28| So the new design standard is the doors open into the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| and we'll just work around some of the traffic concerns in the hallway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6932)|
| 1:55:38| but it eliminates a place for someone to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| So those are just some examples of the kinds of stuff that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| There are many more, and we expect the architects that we employ to adhere to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6947)|
| 1:55:54| Let me ask you one other thing about utilizing property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| You have, like, Carnes High School that's in the 6th District right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| I think it was originally designed for, what, about 2,000 students, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| Okay, we took 1,000 students out of that building and sent it to Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| and we've got over 2,000 students at Hardin Valley, but we've still got about 1,200 students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| 1,200 or 1,300 students in the Carnes School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| Is there ways for schools like that that are not getting back up to that amount of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6983)|
| 1:56:30| to maybe do some redesigning in there to make it a more modern school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| and some other things that we can add on to and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| by utilizing the buildings that are not completely full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=6997)|
| 1:56:42| And while I was saying that, I looked at some of the things that were said to me about schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7002)|
| 1:56:48| We have a school that has 70 students in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7008)|
| 1:56:51| and that's not like a Paul Kelly or something like that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| And then we have some that's over 2,000 students in there in high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| And I was just wondering what could we do to optimize the buildings we do have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7021)|
| 1:57:08| and make them even better by redesigning some of those classrooms and things in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| to really utilize it much more for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| And I read some things about how you do assessments now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| They have six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| One of them had six different things about how, and they had their names for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7041)|
| 1:57:30| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7050)|
| 1:57:31| What was it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| Modern assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| It has one diagnostic assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| Afformative assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7057)|
| 1:57:39| You have submative assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| Norm-referenced assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| Criterion-referenced assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| And interim assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| And I don't know what they mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| I just read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| It just sounded interesting on how we're having to assess students in the modern time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| with all the things that the student has to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| And I don't know how we can get that into the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| The work of the assess and find out what the students need in those particular schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| because different schools need different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| Schools out north may need different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| or different ways of teaching than they do in south Knoxville, east Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| or west Knoxville, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| How do we do those assessments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7104)|
| 1:58:25| How can we best reach those kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| And the last time since you weren't here last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| and I was talking about the schools the last two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| that we graduated kids and just handed them a diploma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| and they weren't ready to be really graduating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| but we handed them diplomas and out you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| And once they walk through the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| we can't get those back to really take care of the needs that they would have had to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| in education to succeed in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| So what are we doing with what we've got now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7133)|
| 1:58:56| We'll make sure that doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| I can't talk to you about the educational programs because that's not my specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7138)|
| 1:59:04| But what I can tell you is the educational programs affect how we use the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| And the educational programs affect the capacity of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| And, you know, one of my pet peeves over time has been how do you calculate capacity in a school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7153)|
| 1:59:20| And there's about half a dozen different ways to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| And I can tell you that based on how capacity is calculated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| most of our schools are running very close to capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| and a number of them are running over capacity, and we work to try to adjust that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| But let me tell you what capacity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| If I come back as a principal and I put in a program like you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| and I'm serving 15 kids in that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| well, I've got 15 kids particularly in the classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| but it's a program I need and it's a program those 15 kids need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| But when I put 15 kids in a classroom, I've just made the capacity of that classroom 15, not 30, not 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7196)|
| 2:00:04| When I come back and I say I want a lower pupil-teacher ratio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| whether it's at the elementary school, middle school, or high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| and I say I want a pupil-teacher ratio of 18 to 1 or 20 to 1 or 25 to 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7211)|
| 2:00:18| I've just made that the capacity of those classrooms in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| So that's the challenge that we have to deal with and to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| and that's what makes our schools so close to capacity or how to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| And we consider that when we're designing new schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| and we consider that in the maintenance of our older schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| And more than that, I don't know how to explain what you're trying to get to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7240)|
| 2:00:49| Commissioner, let me just add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7249)|
| 2:00:51| And, of course, John's here too to talk about if you wanted to hear more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| But we're partnering with Ford Next Generation to reimagine our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| I think there are seven high schools, I believe, John, this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| There's been a lot of work done with community, with students, and different partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| to design high schools where, like you say, different areas might require and need different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7270)|
| 2:01:17| I think the goal is to eventually have all high schools participating in Ford Next Generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| but there are seven coming online for this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| John and his team have done a tremendous job, in my opinion, of meeting with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| Students have been involved, communities have been involved, parents have been involved in this redesign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| And Ford Next Generation has done a lot of work across the country in terms of with high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7296)|
| 2:01:43| and reimagining those schools and achieved great results, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| in terms of preparing students for their exit from high school to whatever they want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| career, post-secondary, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| So John can speak to that much better eloquently than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7315)|
| 2:02:00| And, John, when you get up here, what I was talking about 10 or so years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7320)|
| 2:02:07| I was in a school and there were some people that were retiring from auto mechanics, CTE class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7327)|
| 2:02:16| and I was asking why they were doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| Because they said because technology was changing so fast they couldn't keep up with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7339)|
| 2:02:24| and what they were teaching was not viable out in the workforce, what those kids were learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7344)|
| 2:02:29| So they said, we weren't doing any good, so they decided to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7349)|
| 2:02:34| And technology and stuff is changing so fastly today in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7354)|
| 2:02:41| I don't know how we keep up with it because I was looking at some of the new modern schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| that they have in other areas and what they've done there to meet these needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| So when they walk out of school, they're ready for the workforce or are prepared for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7369)|
| 2:02:55| And that's what I was getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| How do we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| How can we utilize the abilities we do have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| And, again, I was looking at you talking about capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| If you take all this, I figured out that there was like 17,000 high school students in 13 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7385)|
| 2:03:12| which is about 1,100 students per high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| What is the optimal level that you can have that you can train the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| and have enough teachers there to teach many different subjects to different needs for different students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| And right now we kind of limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| Like let's say if I put 15 students in here like what was just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| then that class is 15 students, which it could have held 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| but that's all we needed for that point right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| How do we get around those problems and can we do that in any particular way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| since we've still got a lot of school building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| So Mr. Thomas alluded to some of the work that we're doing with Forward Next Generation Learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| and really the goal behind that is how do we engage with business partners and community partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| Our Career and Tech Ed program actually has come a long way in the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| and part of the goal of that is how are we purposely working with students as far back as middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| to see what their aptitudes are and see what their abilities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| and then to get them into high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| Now we understand we're not necessarily going to produce kids out of high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| some that are ready to go to work, but a lot of them may need some additional training beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7457)|
| 2:04:22| But it's important for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| So we start all the way back in middle school doing some assessments called U-Science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| Y-O-U like the science of U, that kind of shows what aptitudes students have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| and some of those careers they've never been exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| There's a lot of research that shows students typically will do what they've been exposed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| what their parents have done or that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| So the idea is you start earlier in middle school to kind of get an idea of some of these other jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| And then we've worked in our middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| and are really just in the early stages of kind of career exploration through career fairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| through guest speakers, through embracing local industry, local job markets that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| And then as Mr. Thomas said, that's kind of the whole work of the Ford Next Generation of Learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7496)|
| 2:05:00| Kind of traditional high schools have kind of offered all these elective classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| Some of them lead to a career and some of them are just fun, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| And so really what the Ford work is is working with the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| They've been a good partner with us as well and other industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| We've had four meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| I've had over 150 business people, parents, and school people working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7516)|
| 2:05:22| to try to design kind of academy structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| And what that does is it allows kind of an elective focus for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| So they'll still take their math and their English and their reading and their social studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| They'll still take band and fine arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| But for those elective courses that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| the idea is it starts to expose them from their freshman year on to the exact things you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7535)|
| 2:05:40| Some that may be kind of building trade jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7540)|
| 2:05:42| Some may be STEM jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| Some may be those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7544)|
| 2:05:45| So it gets them hands-on experience with business partners that potentially could lead to internships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7550)|
| 2:05:51| We understand not every student will make their decision from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| Some will go on to college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7554)|
| 2:05:55| Some will do other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| But our hope is that they get that kind of experiential learning through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| and how to be part of a workforce and understand what that looks like so that that serves them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| Nashville's done some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| And in those schools, we've heard and interviewed and talked to some of their seniors that have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7566)|
| 2:06:11| you know, I always thought I wanted to go in the medical profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7571)|
| 2:06:13| I took four years of kind of health science classes in high school and realized that's not what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| I want to go in business when I go in college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| And, you know, for us, that's a win because then those students, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| and those families understand a little more about the career they may or may not want to go into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7582)|
| 2:06:26| So we are doing a lot of work on that, on the redesign and kind of reimagine high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| But it really starts back in middle school with those kinds of exposures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| I want to say one thing, too, that you mentioned on assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| So when you talk about formative assessment or summative assessment, you talk about those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| You talk about we do all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| So a summative is more like what you'll see at the end of the year, kind of what the state puts out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| kind of the accumulation of everything they've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7608)|
| 2:06:50| A formative is kind of snapshots in time two or three times a year to see how kids are doing against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7610)|
| 2:06:57| We do that with an assessment called Case 21 that helps us project where students will be on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7617)|
| 2:07:02| So everything that you named in that list of different assessments, we do those at different levels in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7622)|
| 2:07:08| And really, you know, the goal of assessment is not just to test kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| The goal is that's part of the learning cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| You always ask, what do you want students to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| That's kind of your standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7636)|
| 2:07:17| How will they know it and how will you teach it is what the teachers do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7637)|
| 2:07:20| And then you assess to go, did they learn it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| And if not, the next step is how do you intervene to help close that gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| All of our schools are doing that in learning cycles in all of our schools right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| So assessment is an important part of that, but really it's got to function in the learning cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| I want to thank you all for coming here and talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| I'm not trying to get up here and say, ha-ha, I got you, or anything like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| There's a lot of people out there that was raised in one kind of school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7660)|
| 2:07:46| and the school systems have changed so much that they don't understand what's going on in schools now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7666)|
| 2:07:52| And that's what a lot of people are asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7672)|
| 2:07:58| Why aren't the kids doing this or why aren't they doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| Because things have changed so much as far as technology and those sort of things that we didn't have when I was growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7681)|
| 2:08:09| But there again, there's so much that you have to learn to get them prepared for the next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7689)|
| 2:08:17| And I think a lot of people like me is worried about those young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| to make sure that they have what they need when they walk out of high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7701)|
| 2:08:25| that they have enough to where they can make a decision where they want to go on to college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7705)|
| 2:08:29| where they want to go into a career form and learn that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7709)|
| 2:08:33| I just wanted to know, and I thank you for the information you gave me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7713)|
| 2:08:38| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| One other thing I was going to say is we did launch three virtual schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| and also were able to provide one-to-one technology for every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| So to address that, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| I mean, that has been a great thing for all of our students to now have laptops that we maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7728)|
| 2:08:54| And then we have a middle, elementary, and high school virtual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| And some students have been very successful in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7737)|
| 2:08:59| I mean, it's been another option for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| And students have done very well in that, that have chosen to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| So we continue to innovate, and we appreciate the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| Thank you, Dr. Resnick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Commissioner Schoonmaker had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| Where are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7752)|
| 2:09:16| I'm right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7756)|
| 2:09:17| This is actually the first opportunity I've had to congratulate you on your new opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| and we look forward to working with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7762)|
| 2:09:26| The other thing is if one of the three team members happens to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| how many facilities or buildings under the Knox County Schools jurisdiction that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7770)|
| 2:09:37| that you're no longer utilizing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| Say thank you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| The answer to that question would be zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7788)|
| 2:09:49| So there's no vacant buildings at all in Knox County School System at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7789)|
| 2:09:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7794)|
| 2:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7797)|
| 2:09:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| Thank you, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| Madam Clerk, before we move to the last discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7800)|
| 2:10:06| the clerk reminded me Item 29, which was an honorary resolution that we actually read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| and heard last week, actually does need to be voted on at the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7812)|
| 2:10:17| So if you'll read Item 29, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7817)|
| 2:10:22| Discussion of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7822)|
| 2:10:25| honoring the Powell High School football team for winning the Class 5A state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| This is Resolution 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7831)|
| 2:10:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Motion to approve by Commissioner Busler with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7842)|
| 2:10:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| That is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| Now, Madam Clerk, Item 41, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Discussion item regarding the consolidation and streamlining of the government relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| on the zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| Commissioner Ward, you are recognized, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7859)|
| 2:11:00| After last week's report on housing, I got to talk to the mayor and Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| and I'd like to invite them up and some of our friends from the building industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7866)|
| 2:11:15| Mr. Snowden and I have talked about some solutions to try to streamline the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7875)|
| 2:11:20| and make it a little bit quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| Right now, it takes about nine months, give or take, to go from buying a piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| to actually breaking ground on starting to build it, trying to streamline it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| So, Mr. Snowden, if you could come up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| I had a couple of ideas, and our friends from the Home Builders Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| if you guys could also come up, please, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7898)|
| 2:11:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7903)|
| 2:11:44| Thanks, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7904)|
| 2:11:45| We'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Obviously, we do try to streamline our processes in every which way we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| We currently now allow for pre-approved plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7913)|
| 2:11:56| That was one of the things that Hanson mentioned last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| that if someone does want to go through and submit the plan, we'll review that plan, stamp it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7919)|
| 2:12:05| Then when it comes in the next time, we don't have to make a detailed review on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| which does save some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7929)|
| 2:12:11| Our office sets standards of no more than two to three working days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7931)|
| 2:12:14| to get out a single-family building permit home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| We usually try to set five to seven working days on a commercial permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7939)|
| 2:12:23| so we do try to get those things out as soon as we can to reduce the cost to the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7943)|
| 2:12:28| Some of the things we're doing long term, in addition to the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7948)|
| 2:12:33| is I want to create what's called a unified development ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| Much like our plans, we have sector plans and small area plans and general plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7957)|
| 2:12:45| and just a lot of different plans that are convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7965)|
| 2:12:48| What I want to do is create a unified development ordinance that will, much like those plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| we have a sidewalk ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| We have a road standard specification ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7977)|
| 2:13:00| We have a flood damage prevention ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| We have a stormwater ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7982)|
| 2:13:04| Our process is a little bit convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| As part of this process, I talked to the mayor last week after this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| we're going to engage a consultant to look at kind of a 30,000-foot view of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| maybe look at some of the other surrounding jurisdictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| and find ways that we can implement that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| as part of the back end of the land use and transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| We appreciate the conversation and are excited to hopefully improve what we feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| are already good processes, but certainly try to improve them if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| I'd just like to ask the friends in the home builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| if you guys just give a little bit of assessment from your perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| We heard from the realtors last week and just want to hear from you guys this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| If you gentlemen would state your name and address as you come up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8025)|
| 2:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Ashla Burnett, Home Builders Association of Greater Knoxville, 221 Clark Street, Knoxville 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8029)|
| 2:13:55| I represent the Home Builders Association, about 350 member companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8035)|
| 2:14:00| builders, suppliers who build houses around Knox County and surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| I am familiar with the realtor's report that was presented last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| We agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| Housing is in a pretty dire situation right now, but we do appreciate the opportunity to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8052)|
| 2:14:18| The upcoming plan changes, we're available to assist with that however we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8058)|
| 2:14:25| A couple of the things that were mentioned are the regulations that add to the cost of the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| A lot of those happened during the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| So I think it's a great idea to streamline some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| I do have with me some experts who do this for a living, that build houses, develop land day in and day out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8079)|
| 2:14:46| They might be better suited to answering your questions either tonight or through the process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8086)|
| 2:14:54| So I can introduce Saddlebrook Properties and let them say a few things on the technical side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8094)|
| 2:15:01| but we definitely appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8101)|
| 2:15:08| Thanks, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8108)|
| 2:15:09| Brian Mone, Saddlebrook Properties, president and owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8109)|
| 2:15:12| We build a lot of houses out in West Knoxville primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| We're invited down here to talk a little bit about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8116)|
| 2:15:21| and I brought my VP of Development to get to the nitty-gritty of what it's like going through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8121)|
| 2:15:26| if you want to go through it here at Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| Sir, if you could speak just a little closer to the microphone so the commissioners can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8133)|
| 2:15:34| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8134)|
| 2:15:35| Good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8135)|
| 2:15:37| Mr. Odom was up here, and he mentioned housing affordability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| and I wanted to share with you guys my personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8140)|
| 2:15:43| I'm not an attorney or a politician, so I don't know exactly how to change ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| but I've been living the pandemic home builder life for the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8146)|
| 2:15:54| Knox County has the same problem that the entire United States of America has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8154)|
| 2:16:00| We've studied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| I've read everything I can read, and I'm a major in economics and finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8161)|
| 2:16:08| and I have a very talented team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8168)|
| 2:16:12| There is no solution to housing affordability except for more houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8172)|
| 2:16:17| I'm not lobbying for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| I'm just telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8178)|
| 2:16:19| That's the only way this works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8179)|
| 2:16:21| You guys know that we were not building in the recession era as much as the population was growing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8181)|
| 2:16:29| This is a problem that I do not have the solution to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8189)|
| 2:16:32| I just know that it is that if you want to devalue something, you get more of it, just like the U.S. dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8192)|
| 2:16:39| That's how we play with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| Or if something's in low demand, its price can drop naturally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| One of the things I pulled from this car report that I think got the attention of a lot of people here in Knoxville and the news stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8206)|
| 2:16:52| and I'm not going to read these out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8212)|
| 2:16:54| Data is data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8214)|
| 2:16:55| It's come from car here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| We have 35 percent higher home prices than we did before the pandemic here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8217)|
| 2:17:04| That is very accurate for new construction costs for my company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| The eight best floor plans we have range from 30 to 39 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| That's a record cost since November 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| I'm saying this to tell you that there's problems that go so far beyond what any municipality can do to overcome the issue in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8239)|
| 2:17:29| You'll hear about it for the next decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| Who knows what's going to happen with interest rates or the overall economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| An existential event that can really cripple the entire economy makes this conversation useless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8255)|
| 2:17:41| But what we do know is that home building is extremely local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8261)|
| 2:17:46| And what I read in the NAHB's newsletters and what I see out there about home sales decline, this thing went up, this went bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8266)|
| 2:17:52| all the articles that everyone's sharing, you know, think they know what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| It's all local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| Are you hearing this, Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| Sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8280)|
| 2:18:01| Other times, not so much at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| We're having a lot of people move in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| It's my opinion that it is a good thing for a city to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| It is a good thing for people to have jobs when they live in a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8289)|
| 2:18:13| And to have jobs, they must have places to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| We are getting tons of interest from outside because the data is showing that this is a place that has good things about it that people want to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8296)|
| 2:18:25| For any reason that there is, 90% of our sales in some months, not all, were to people from outside of Knox County and mostly the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8305)|
| 2:18:36| To talk a little bit about what else we're seeing here, it seems that we need 50,000 new homes in Knoxville, according to this report, over the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8316)|
| 2:18:46| That's 5,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| Last year was the best year ever, 4,100 permits pulled here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| We're outpricing everyone that lives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| We don't sell to people who live here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| They think it's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| They think it's crazy what we can sell houses for because they've been here for 10, 20, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8342)|
| 2:19:07| And it just happens so incredibly fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| What are the things that affect affordability and what are the things that can be done from a municipal standpoint or a policy standpoint that can help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8349)|
| 2:19:17| Okay, the pandemic created situations that basically took us into overdrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8357)|
| 2:19:23| Affordability was a problem long, long, long before everyone in this town took note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8363)|
| 2:19:30| We knew it was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| The NAHB knew it was a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| And it was, oh, my gosh, houses are getting so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8373)|
| 2:19:35| And we just went into overdrive because the global supply chain was so interconnected, we realized that if it breaks in China or it breaks in France or it breaks somewhere else, that very, very, very entangled web, it's like the butterfly effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8375)|
| 2:19:50| So they just went to shutdown in Shanghai, China, for nine days or 10 days today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| No one's building anything in Shanghai.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| We did it in Shenzhen not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| When is that going to hit us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8401)|
| 2:20:02| The boat got stuck in the Suez Canal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| It was almost like a joke from God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8404)|
| 2:20:06| What else could possibly happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| A boat turned sideways and blocked the global logistics supply chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8407)|
| 2:20:13| So we've been dealing with challenges way beyond just zoning and all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8413)|
| 2:20:18| But what we have in Knoxville are geographic constraints to producing housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8418)|
| 2:20:24| We have rivers, mountains, hillside protection, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8424)|
| 2:20:29| We must get creative in our zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8429)|
| 2:20:33| We must get faster in our rezoning process, not more irresponsible, not more irresponsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| But we have only so much land left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| If we don't utilize it well, then it's going to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8443)|
| 2:20:49| And you can't demolish West Hills right now because they're half-acre lots and build density over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| You can't demolish Sequoia Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8454)|
| 2:20:56| These parcels still have great value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| We're not to the point where we're tearing down houses and building duplexes in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| We're getting there quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| My point is is that there's very little left to develop, and the need is so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8464)|
| 2:21:11| One of the things that is going to have to happen is that we increase the supply of houses to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8471)|
| 2:21:19| We are building as fast as we can under pandemic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8479)|
| 2:21:23| I have stored half a million dollars of lumber behind razor wire for months just to get to make sure it didn't cripple our business entirely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8483)|
| 2:21:31| The houses were sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| We just ordered it before it went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| Right now, LCUB has sent us a memo that says they will only be providing transformers to finished, completed houses or restorative services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8496)|
| 2:21:46| I believe those were the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8506)|
| 2:21:49| And that I need to build my houses on generators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| We're facing a lot of other cost increases, 35 percent to be exact, you know, over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8513)|
| 2:22:01| We don't need any more pressure from new codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| We don't need the special deck brackets that Farragut requires to increase my house by $1,000 because decks have been built for a long time and they're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8525)|
| 2:22:14| There's all kinds of things, like fresh air intakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8534)|
| 2:22:17| We're building airtight homes in the town of Farragut in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| There's something called a blower door test where you suck all the air out of the house, and you find out how many air exchanges the house has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8541)|
| 2:22:28| And then you go in the attic, and then you bring in air because the house is depressurized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8548)|
| 2:22:34| In West Hills myself, my house leaks like a sieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| My bills are low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8557)|
| 2:22:38| It's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8558)|
| 2:22:39| My property value is high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8559)|
| 2:22:41| It is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8561)|
| 2:22:43| But you go into these other municipalities that are adopting other codes or adopting new regulation that is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| It is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8568)|
| 2:22:49| You can help save the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| I want to, and I agree with a lot of the things going on in the environment right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8571)|
| 2:22:55| There are things going on that are way, way, way bigger than me having to make someone caulk in between every stud to make sure that the air cannot move out of that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8575)|
| 2:23:05| It's a safety issue to some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| My point is I'm giving you real-life examples that you can listen to and take with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| More, be it zoning, environmental, or code ordinances, and I would not be saying any of this if I wasn't very confident in public health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8590)|
| 2:23:20| We are building great houses today under the codes that exist here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8600)|
| 2:23:26| The inspectors, the inspections, what can we do to increase the speed or velocity that we can get these great houses built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8606)|
| 2:23:34| I mean, I feel bad, but there's not really a great solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| Inspections, there are too many, and there are not enough inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8618)|
| 2:23:43| Bring it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8623)|
| 2:23:45| Bring on the inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8625)|
| 2:23:47| So that we don't have to wait anymore, or we don't have to be at a job for six-hour windows because there's so many to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| That's a labor shortage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| That's going to be happening for everyone, and I don't know how to solve that or to get more people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8635)|
| 2:23:59| Here's another tangible item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| We have a slab inspection where you get to see all your slab plumbing and everything coming out, and a slab energy inspection in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8642)|
| 2:24:09| The difference is we roll black plastic down, and we put foam around the corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| We could probably take a picture and send it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8654)|
| 2:24:17| And you say, oh, well, then how do we know you just didn't take it and move it to the next house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| The inspector just went, looked out the window, and he just left, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8661)|
| 2:24:25| It's not a problem to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8665)|
| 2:24:27| There's things that can be consolidated, such as in the zoning process, rezoning and concept approval at one meeting, something to be explored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8667)|
| 2:24:36| And these can be occurrences that are specialized for certain projects, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8676)|
| 2:24:41| The lead time it takes to get approvals for a subdivision here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| We've never started doing anything within six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8686)|
| 2:24:50| These landowners, for instance, if you would have wanted to rezone something and you didn't turn it in today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8690)|
| 2:24:58| because that was the deadline for May's Planning Commission meeting, I believe, for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8698)|
| 2:25:03| then you would have had to tell whoever was selling their land that, I'm sorry, I can't do this contract in five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8703)|
| 2:25:09| I need six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| There's all kinds of things that we can workshop with Jim and the Planning Commission and you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8711)|
| 2:25:17| And I don't know what to really suggest specifically, what is okay and what is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| But Saddlebrook and I know the HBA and many other builders in town are very much willing to workshop this with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8723)|
| 2:25:32| Commissioner Biggs, your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8732)|
| 2:25:33| Did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8733)|
| 2:25:35| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8735)|
| 2:25:37| Is it Brian?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8737)|
| 2:25:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| So let me ask you a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| Give me a comparison piece to if you get a stop work order in the city and then in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| how hard is it to get somebody to come out once you feel like the problem's been remedied so you can continue on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8747)|
| 2:25:54| I don't think I've ever had a stop work order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8754)|
| 2:25:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8756)|
| 2:25:57| My next question is, you say you don't know the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| but it sounds like some of the issues are within the city of Knoxville and the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8761)|
| 2:26:06| So the mayor said the good and the bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| You guys are really good at stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8769)|
| 2:26:11| Would you think a metro codes division between the city and the county would work with the county spearhead since we obviously do a better job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8771)|
| 2:26:22| I don't know the answer to that because I don't know what all it would entail or what it all means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8787)|
| 2:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8788)|
| 2:26:29| I do have some smarter people here with me if you want to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8792)|
| 2:26:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker and Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8795)|
| 2:26:38| You mentioned 4,100 building permits pulled in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| I believe that's what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| Yeah, I'm just reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Of the building permits that were pulled, how many actually got construction started on them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| That's a great question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8815)|
| 2:26:57| You'd have to do a lot of – and I think there's some alliances now tracking that, particularly in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8817)|
| 2:27:03| The public has gone to driving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8823)|
| 2:27:05| And that's the same thing Edsel Charles does out of Nashville, and he would be a great resource as well, is that these things get platted and then nothing's built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8825)|
| 2:27:14| So they actually drive the subdivisions and pay their staff to create these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8834)|
| 2:27:18| Would you take a guess that 50% of them got started building on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| The homes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| The homes themselves or the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8847)|
| 2:27:28| Because you said that we need 5,000 homes a year, and if we're getting 4,100 permits but we're only building 2,000 homes, we're way behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8848)|
| 2:27:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| And Kim Frazier with the Hardin Valley Planning Alliance has some data that she's provided us that, frankly, I'm not regurgitating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8862)|
| 2:27:49| I don't know if it's true, but she does regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| There's a lot of things that have been approved and unbuilt, particularly in Hardin Valley, because as you all know, the northwest sector has been the epicenter of growth in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8871)|
| 2:28:01| So it's a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8881)|
| 2:28:02| And we have problems too, John, with – like I said, there's problems outside of just zoning right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8882)|
| 2:28:09| And the biggest ones are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8889)|
| 2:28:12| Great presentation, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8892)|
| 2:28:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8893)|
| 2:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8894)|
| 2:28:15| Can you help me with transformers, anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| If you can, let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| Commissioner Bussler and then Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8901)|
| 2:28:23| Mr. Monaghan, I want to say I was in the Home Builders a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8903)|
| 2:28:28| In fact, I started working with your dad when he first got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| Anyway, you were talking about codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8912)|
| 2:28:36| I know the codes have changed a lot since I've been inside the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8916)|
| 2:28:42| I thought we had that almost taken care of at one time about how we tried to make sure that codes were more precise for the area that it was in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8922)|
| 2:28:51| We have problems getting – one time we were under a building code that we had to build under thermal frost or something like that, foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| You had to put extra insulation in, which we don't have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8938)|
| 2:29:02| Is that the kind of issues you're running up against, or is it like some of the Canadian lumber I heard now that we're getting, somebody put a big tariff on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8942)|
| 2:29:10| So we wouldn't get that much lumber out of Canada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| Are those the type of situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8954)|
| 2:29:16| Is it supply chain someplace, or is it building codes, or is it a combination of all of them that's causing you the problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8956)|
| 2:29:23| It is a combination of all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8963)|
| 2:29:25| It is for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| As we hopefully exit this supply chain debacle, and I still think we haven't seen the worst in the inflation numbers too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8966)|
| 2:29:33| we knew this was coming a long time ago because we're seeing the plumbers and the timber and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8973)|
| 2:29:39| We're seeing it live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| The reports that come out from the United States of America don't even count some of the sectors that we are looking at, inflationary numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8980)|
| 2:29:49| Again, the county is actually very good with permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| Let me say what's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8993)|
| 2:29:54| We get permits back fast from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8994)|
| 2:29:56| It's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| I don't know that it could be any faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8997)|
| 2:29:59| This, of all the municipalities we build in, is the best as far as codes go and difficulty to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=8999)|
| 2:30:08| We are overbuilding in some other municipalities, but who am I to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9008)|
| 2:30:11| Those are the codes adopted in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9011)|
| 2:30:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9013)|
| 2:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9016)|
| 2:30:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9018)|
| 2:30:23| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9023)|
| 2:30:26| Engineering and Public Works is on the front end of the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9026)|
| 2:30:33| When it's in a concept idea and it's the zoning idea all the way through to the day you certify it and adopt the roads and do the plats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9033)|
| 2:30:43| when you look at your department, are there a few things that you could identify that would help optimize our time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9043)|
| 2:30:54| and our resources that we support our building community with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9054)|
| 2:31:00| Is there anything that you've actually really wanted to do this but for the lack of resources or people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9060)|
| 2:31:08| You mentioned a few earlier, but I wondered if you just had time to process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| I think we do a pretty good job with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9072)|
| 2:31:16| To Brian's point, sometimes we are a little – we try to get a building inspection scheduled within –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9076)|
| 2:31:24| certainly within the same week it's called in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| Oftentimes we might could use a couple of building inspectors from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9088)|
| 2:31:34| but it's kind of cyclical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9094)|
| 2:31:37| We might need it some weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9097)|
| 2:31:39| It might not need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| We do a real good job on plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9101)|
| 2:31:43| Once the concept is approved, I went back and looked as part of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9103)|
| 2:31:49| For the most part, once the engineer submits his design plans that correspond to the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9109)|
| 2:31:55| usually within a week we're providing comments and if the design is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| actually issuing an approved design plan to where we can actually go to construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220328?start=9119)|
