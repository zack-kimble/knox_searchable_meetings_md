|     116 |   122 | I just want to take this point of personal privilege since we had our junior commissioners                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=116.0)  |
|     122 |   129 | here and I wanted to let the chairman of the junior commissioners program know that my                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=122.0)  |
|     129 |   133 | junior commissioner, Mr. Patel, went above and beyond the call of duty.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=129.0)  |
|     133 |   138 | You know, one of the requirements was that they had to do a community service project                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=133.0)  |
|     138 |   140 | and shadow their commissioner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=138.0)  |
|     140 |   143 | So he did above and beyond everything else.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=140.0)  |

|     146 |   151 | I don't know if the camera can focus in on this, but he got, there's a picture there                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=146.0)  |

|     154 |   160 | So I just wanted you to know he did complete his project and this is now evidence of that.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=154.0)  |

|    1397 |  1402 | We had a very public launch a couple weeks ago and had over 50 organizations                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1397.0) |

|    1404 |  1408 | So we had a good start, but I think we probably need to do more.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1404.0) |

|    1425 |  1429 | Ms. Kittrell, you talked about the funding model.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1425.0) |
|    1429 |  1432 | Is any of that estimate that you presented funded,                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1429.0) |
|    1432 |  1438 | or is that sort of an optimistic goal of what you hope to rally to make this                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1432.0) |

|    1440 |  1445 | We do have almost 5 million of it funded and identified funds,                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1440.0) |
|    1445 |  1448 | so it's still fairly optimistic.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1445.0) |

|    1780 |  1787 | I thought or I knew, better yet, at Anthony Thompson, Jr., she showed me who she was when                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1780.0) |

|    1819 |  1825 | scene and that he forgot about it so long his wife returned on his behalf, I thought then,                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1819.0) |
|    1825 |  1831 | then maybe the council, the county commission will ask Charm Allen what is her operation of business.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1825.0) |

|    1849 |  1852 | and they tried to cover it all up, she should have been fired then.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=1849.0) |

|    2905 |  2911 | or we have to refuse all of them, send them back to the mayor, and ask for a new list.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2905.0) |
|    2911 |  2917 | Is that correct, Mr. Butte or Mr. Boyers?                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2911.0) |
|    2917 |  2919 | That is essentially correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2917.0) |
|    2919 |  2925 | I think you could maybe, if you wanted to accept certain and reject certain, you could do that as well.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2919.0) |
|    2925 |  2931 | Normally it's for the mayor to recommend and the commission to approve or not approve.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2925.0) |

|    2944 |  2948 | I think this is important.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=2944.0) |

|    3936 |  3942 | but we feel like that my department's better served to do that just because                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3936.0) |
|    3942 |  3945 | that's, you know, we're, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3942.0) |
|    3945 |  3949 | one of the things that we do really well is widen roadways.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3945.0) |
|    3949 |  3955 | So we would like to have that ability to, for the developer to enter an MOU                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3949.0) |

|    3960 |  3963 | as required by the Planning Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3960.0) |
|    3963 |  3966 | and just reimburse the county for those costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3963.0) |
|    3966 |  3969 | That way we can do what we're good at                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3966.0) |
|    3969 |  3974 | and the developer can, you know, do what he's good at, which is greenfield development.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3969.0) |

|    3977 |  3980 | It's not going to be like a 50-50.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3977.0) |
|    3980 |  3983 | It could vary from different project to different project.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3980.0) |

|    3991 |  3995 | and we know we're going to do it the correct way, the width, the length, and all that.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=3991.0) |

|    4002 |  4005 | you're going to say it's going to cost half a million dollars,                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4002.0) |
|    4005 |  4010 | and the developer agrees to pay $300,000 of that $500,000.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4005.0) |

|    4040 |  4045 | and that way we can equitably split out what costs are the counties                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4040.0) |

|    4055 |  4057 | So I'm a developer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4055.0) |
|    4057 |  4060 | It may not be fair, but that's the way it's going to be.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4057.0) |
|    4060 |  4065 | I'm on a road, and I'm the developer, and I've got to pay to fix this road, this portion of it.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4060.0) |
|    4065 |  4069 | Then the next two years later, there's another developer that comes in,                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4065.0) |
|    4069 |  4072 | and he didn't have to pay for this part of the road.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4069.0) |
|    4072 |  4074 | And I don't know if we can fix that.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4072.0) |
|    4074 |  4079 | It's just too late to the party type deal, but they would still have to fix their section of the road.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4074.0) |
|    4079 |  4083 | But they got the benefit of not having to fix the whole road.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4079.0) |
|    4083 |  4085 | Does that make sense?                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4083.0) |
|    4085 |  4086 | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4085.0) |
|    4086 |  4093 | That cumulative effect of development is one of the things that really we don't have a tool that can address it.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4086.0) |
|    4093 |  4097 | If the developments come in simultaneously or while we're in the process,                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4093.0) |
|    4097 |  4101 | we can reflect those agreements or modify them to reflect it.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4097.0) |
|    4101 |  4104 | But to your point, if it comes in after the fact,                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4101.0) |
|    4104 |  4112 | then there's really no way or mechanism we have to require that additional participation.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4104.0) |
|    4112 |  4114 | Mr. Ward?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4112.0) |
|    4114 |  4116 | I talked to the home builders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4114.0) |
|    4116 |  4124 | The only question that they had was is the release going to be upon the receipt of the funds                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4116.0) |
|    4124 |  4130 | or upon the completion because you're holding their land plots,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4124.0) |
|    4130 |  4134 | so they want to know as soon as they pay you, is that obligation then met,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4130.0) |
|    4134 |  4136 | rather than waiting for you to complete the construction?                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4134.0) |
|    4136 |  4140 | Because in theory, what they're afraid of, you could drag your feet for years                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4136.0) |
|    4140 |  4143 | and then they would never get their property released.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4140.0) |
|    4143 |  4145 | Could you clarify that for me?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4143.0) |
|    4145 |  4147 | Correct. Good question, Commissioner Ward.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4145.0) |
|    4147 |  4152 | Once they enter into the MOU or other mechanism as it would be,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4147.0) |
|    4152 |  4156 | their approvals would be released at that point.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4152.0) |

|    4169 |  4175 | I think we could approve things on the front end as well as stagger the reimbursements.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4169.0) |

|    4198 |  4206 | Director Stone, I know there's been some discussion about Commissioner Ward's point there                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4198.0) |
|    4206 |  4214 | about completion of road improvements prior to permits being released.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4206.0) |
|    4214 |  4221 | If that's the case, would that condition need to be made either at the Planning Commission level                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4214.0) |
|    4221 |  4223 | or this Commission level?                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4221.0) |
|    4223 |  4226 | Would that need to be read into the motion as a condition                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4223.0) |
|    4226 |  4231 | that the project not only needs to be entered into an MOU and payments made,                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4226.0) |
|    4231 |  4237 | but the improvements must be completed before permits are granted?                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4231.0) |
|    4237 |  4242 | Correct. And to Commissioner Daly's point, each case is going to be a little different.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4237.0) |
|    4242 |  4248 | Typically, the traffic is based on the number of homes constructed and occupied,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4242.0) |
|    4248 |  4254 | so it may be a situation where we could allow the construction of homes to begin                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4248.0) |
|    4254 |  4261 | but hold COs until such time the need for the improvement was complete.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4254.0) |
|    4261 |  4265 | I think we can look at it a little bit different each time, but you're right.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4261.0) |
|    4265 |  4270 | There may have to be thresholds that are set by either Planning Commission or this body                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4265.0) |
|    4270 |  4276 | to allow for the protection for the public such that a turn lane isn't not constructed                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4270.0) |
|    4276 |  4282 | by the time so many homes are constructed or occupied.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4276.0) |
|    4282 |  4283 | Commissioner Ward?                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4282.0) |
|    4283 |  4288 | If that's the case, can we make sure that there is a time frame set in there?                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4283.0) |
|    4288 |  4295 | Because like I said earlier, for example's sake, you need $100,000 to build a turn lane.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4288.0) |
|    4296 |  4304 | In theory, if we make it that you guys will not release the plots until the turn lane is done,                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4296.0) |
|    4304 |  4308 | I'm not saying you'd ever do this, but you could hold up that construction forever.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4304.0) |

|    4541 |  4551 | We can just kind of run through these and the district commissioner give us their overview.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4541.0) |

|    4583 |  4590 | Just on 65 and 66, I have met with Mr. Graham on this.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4583.0) |
|    4590 |  4592 | It is consistent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4590.0) |
|    4592 |  4594 | I think it will add to the community.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4592.0) |
|    4595 |  4597 | There's a subdivision behind that.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4595.0) |
|    4597 |  4601 | It will not affect them in any matter because they will be entering on Clinton Highway.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4597.0) |
|    4601 |  4606 | So I think this will be good for District 7.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4601.0) |

|    4613 |  4616 | Mr. Moyers, you and I had a discussion about this last time.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4613.0) |
|    4616 |  4619 | If we're going to do this, I think we should probably notify.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4616.0) |

|    4623 |  4626 | I think we should notify the people.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4623.0) |

|    4631 |  4639 | The thing about it is, as I said before, we shouldn't be taking any votes on this.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4631.0) |
|    4639 |  4640 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4639.0) |
|    4640 |  4644 | If you're going to open it up for people to speak on each item,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4640.0) |
|    4644 |  4649 | we're going to have to probably adjust the rules on how these work.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4644.0) |
|    4650 |  4651 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4650.0) |
|    4651 |  4654 | But as long as we're not voting on these things,                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4651.0) |
|    4654 |  4660 | my understanding is we're just sort of getting input from the district commissioner.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4654.0) |
|    4660 |  4663 | But if you want people notified—                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4660.0) |
|    4663 |  4673 | I think in good faith we should have people notified in good action because really—                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4663.0) |
|    4673 |  4677 | I'll just say this the polite way.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4673.0) |
|    4677 |  4679 | The builder knows what his project is,                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4677.0) |
|    4679 |  4683 | and the people that oppose it in the area know what that area is.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4679.0) |
|    4683 |  4690 | And we don't necessarily know all the facts and the figures once we get to this point.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4683.0) |
|    4690 |  4695 | So there's a possibility for a commissioner to make an accusation                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4690.0) |
|    4695 |  4698 | without having the full knowledge of what the situation is,                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4695.0) |
|    4698 |  4702 | which then may persuade votes for the following week.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4698.0) |
|    4702 |  4706 | So I don't know if the practice is a good practice.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4702.0) |
|    4706 |  4710 | If we're going to do it, you almost have to do a full meeting                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4706.0) |

|    4752 |  4753 | I'm fine with doing it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4752.0) |
|    4753 |  4754 | This is what commission wants to do,                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4753.0) |
|    4754 |  4758 | but I think we're going to do this out of respect to the property owner                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4754.0) |

|    4763 |  4765 | It's my personal opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4763.0) |
|    4765 |  4769 | I would say that, subject to being corrected because I'm not certain about this,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4765.0) |
|    4769 |  4773 | I think it's the planning commission that notifies applicants                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4769.0) |
|    4773 |  4780 | and community members about zonings that are going to be on the county commission, I think.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4773.0) |
|    4780 |  4783 | So to do that, we would have to get the planning commission involved                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4780.0) |
|    4783 |  4789 | in putting out signage as they do for the commission meetings.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4783.0) |
|    4789 |  4793 | I don't think they go to everybody and knock on the door.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4789.0) |
|    4793 |  4795 | I think they put up signs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4793.0) |
|    4795 |  4798 | So we'll have to get them to do that at an earlier time.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4795.0) |
|    4798 |  4802 | This is a notified meeting, and traditionally, up until a month or two ago,                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4798.0) |

|    4804 |  4807 | and then we're not notifying the public that we're doing this                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4804.0) |
|    4807 |  4809 | or the property owner that we're doing this.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4807.0) |
|    4809 |  4816 | So I think it would be in good taste to let, you know,                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4809.0) |

|    4824 |  4828 | which is I think it's a dangerous road to go down.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4824.0) |
|    4828 |  4833 | Because I've already seen in the last two months a commissioner say one thing here,                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4828.0) |
|    4833 |  4836 | and then all of a sudden it's a different story once we get there.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4833.0) |
|    4836 |  4840 | So I feel like we're going to end up making a mistake                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4836.0) |
|    4840 |  4843 | that's going to end up costing somebody their livelihood                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4840.0) |

|    4857 |  4858 | They know that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4857.0) |
|    4858 |  4864 | So it is publicly noticed, I guess, three weeks, two weeks before.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4858.0) |

|    4916 |  4918 | they should be involved in the conversation.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4916.0) |

|    4940 |  4942 | Commissioner Ward, I always appreciate his insight                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4940.0) |
|    4942 |  4946 | because he gives a different perspective.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4942.0) |
|    4946 |  4949 | The whole idea behind putting it on as a discussion item                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4946.0) |

|    4954 |  4958 | We would not be asking the public to come forward to the podium                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4954.0) |
|    4958 |  4964 | to get their opinion on the different items on a discussion item like this.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4958.0) |
|    4964 |  4969 | Nor would we be asking the developer to come to the podium and ask.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4964.0) |
|    4969 |  4973 | This is just, like Commissioner Daley said, for general information.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4969.0) |

|    4986 |  4990 | and that was the whole premise of having a pre-meeting                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4986.0) |
|    4990 |  4994 | before our formal meeting just like we do with the work session.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4990.0) |
|    4994 |  4996 | We were advised by the law department                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4994.0) |
|    4996 |  5000 | that we should not be pulling it off the agenda to discuss it,                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=4996.0) |
|    5000 |  5004 | that it would be a better avenue to put it as a discussion item,                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5000.0) |
|    5004 |  5006 | and so that's why I did it this way.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5004.0) |

|    5102 |  5109 | I'm thinking the concern might come is that when we are talking about this from our district,                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5102.0) |
|    5109 |  5115 | sometimes we tend to say, oh, and I think this is okay,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5109.0) |

|    5147 |  5152 | so we do have to rely heavily on presentations that are brought to us,                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5147.0) |
|    5152 |  5162 | and it would, in fact, give a builder or anyone in opposition to it a chance to know who they need to call up here                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5152.0) |
|    5162 |  5170 | in the next week to say, you know, you might have gotten some wrong information or whatever.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5162.0) |
|    5170 |  5177 | So I just say that to say I do clearly see both sides of this.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5170.0) |

|    5179 |  5181 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5179.0) |
|    5181 |  5185 | Yeah, I'm with Commissioner Hill on that.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5181.0) |
|    5185 |  5187 | I see both points here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5185.0) |
|    5187 |  5191 | Would there be anything wrong, kind of like Commissioner Ward suggested,                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5187.0) |
|    5191 |  5196 | would there be anything wrong with the Chairwoman Durrett just asking planning to,                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5191.0) |
|    5196 |  5206 | as part of their procedure, notifying applicants that this item will appear on next month's County Commission meeting                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5196.0) |
|    5206 |  5214 | and may also be discussed at their work session, just so that they would specifically be informed,                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5206.0) |
|    5214 |  5221 | hey, your zoning item could come up for discussion at the work session in case you wanted to attend.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5214.0) |

|    5227 |  5230 | Ms. Brooks may have some thoughts on this.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5227.0) |

|    5232 |  5234 | Good evening, everyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5232.0) |
|    5234 |  5240 | We would be happy to ask Dory Caron, who actually sends out the notices to applicants,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5234.0) |
|    5240 |  5246 | to add that additional language to the notice that goes, if you all would like for them to do so.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5240.0) |

|    5260 |  5262 | Commissioner Frazier.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5260.0) |
|    5262 |  5263 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5262.0) |
|    5263 |  5266 | Again, really great points by my colleagues.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5263.0) |
|    5267 |  5273 | Seeing both sides of this, having kind of been in this arena for quite some time,                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5267.0) |
|    5273 |  5278 | I think it's safe to say that anybody who's in the business of development,                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5273.0) |
|    5278 |  5283 | they know for a hot minute that this comes before commission.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5278.0) |
|    5283 |  5289 | I think the difference is we're now having very meaningful and intentional conversation                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5283.0) |
|    5290 |  5298 | about where we want to be and how we want to move forward when it comes to growth and development.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5290.0) |
|    5298 |  5305 | I'm also concerned with the requirement of staff to be here to answer questions, should we have them.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5298.0) |
|    5305 |  5309 | There's that to take into consideration as well.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5305.0) |
|    5309 |  5317 | And I know that this has been an ongoing discussion about where can we have meaningful discussion.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5309.0) |
|    5317 |  5322 | It's about what's the best way to do that, and we're kind of just chasing our tails.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5317.0) |
|    5322 |  5328 | I think Commissioner Schoonmaker has tried to have pre-agenda discussion meetings.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5322.0) |
|    5328 |  5332 | We've tried to discuss it here at work session.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5328.0) |
|    5332 |  5336 | I'm just really frustrated with this because, like I said,                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5332.0) |
|    5336 |  5342 | I'm hearing from constituents that they're really glad that we're having this discussion,                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5336.0) |
|    5342 |  5346 | even if they're just tuning in and listening or they're going back and watching it on CTV.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5342.0) |
|    5346 |  5355 | So, again, if you live in this world, you know the process and you know the steps.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5346.0) |
|    5355 |  5362 | And I think that's enough.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5355.0) |
|    5362 |  5364 | No?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5362.0) |
|    5364 |  5370 | Any more discussion?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5364.0) |
|    5370 |  5372 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5370.0) |

|    5502 |  5506 | I have not heard any opposition from my district on this.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5502.0) |
|    5506 |  5511 | I think it would be consistent with the Planning Commission recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5506.0) |
|    5514 |  5516 | Thank you, ma'am.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5514.0) |

|    5520 |  5522 | This is the Karate Place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5520.0) |
|    5522 |  5524 | Still trying to work out some issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5522.0) |
|    5524 |  5526 | I don't know if they've been worked out yet or not.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5524.0) |
|    5527 |  5533 | This is the one that should have been transition zone in the first place, in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5527.0) |
|    5533 |  5541 | So, they went back to transition zone, and it did pass planning as a transition zone.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5533.0) |
|    5541 |  5545 | So, we'll know if they've got it all worked out next Monday night.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5541.0) |
|    5547 |  5549 | I mean, it's a no-brainer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5547.0) |
|    5549 |  5550 | I'm not saying that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5549.0) |
|    5550 |  5553 | There's an issue that's got to be fixed first.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5550.0) |

|    5556 |  5558 | And it's not a zoning issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5556.0) |
|    5558 |  5560 | It's another issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5558.0) |

|    5578 |  5580 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5578.0) |
|    5581 |  5586 | This has kind of been ongoing, I guess, since I first became a county commissioner.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5581.0) |
|    5586 |  5598 | I've always thought it was very odd that our printed agenda states one thing, and then we defer to NOx Planning, and they state something entirely different.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5586.0) |
|    5598 |  5604 | What I'm getting at is the way our agenda reads, and I'll just use this as an example.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5598.0) |
|    5604 |  5619 | For a zoning issue, it might say the applicant, Bob Jones, is requesting approval for residential development on XYZ Street, and he's requesting five dwelling units per acre.                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5604.0) |
|    5622 |  5625 | I'm using just a generic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5622.0) |
|    5626 |  5639 | But then we defer to NOx Planning, and they go, Bob Jones, XYZ Street, Planning Commission approved three dwelling units per acre.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5626.0) |
|    5639 |  5652 | So my contention is, why shouldn't the agenda reflect what the Planning Commission's recommendation to us, what the Planning Commissioners voted on on that particular item?                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5639.0) |
|    5653 |  5660 | Because it's very confusing to the public when they're looking at our agenda, and it says, oh my gosh, five dwelling units per acre,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5653.0) |
|    5660 |  5670 | when in fact the real recommendation, not from the Planning staff, but from the Planning Commissioners, have said three dwelling units per acre.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5660.0) |
|    5670 |  5678 | So why don't we actually put what the recommendation is from Planning Commission posted on our agenda?                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5670.0) |
|    5678 |  5680 | And it's easily done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5678.0) |
|    5680 |  5686 | It is. 64 says Planning Commission recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5680.0) |
|    5686 |  5690 | Okay, did she move those over?                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5686.0) |

|    5709 |  5712 | I know this was something we discussed at the retreat.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5709.0) |
|    5712 |  5713 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5712.0) |
|    5713 |  5726 | That we were going to ask Planning to include both the staff recommendation and then the Planning Commission recommendation as well in the captions.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5713.0) |
|    5726 |  5732 | And I think we discussed that before Mr. Moyers joined us.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5726.0) |
|    5732 |  5734 | I mean, this was years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5732.0) |
|    5734 |  5740 | We talked about you can always ask, I mean, you can see in the case file what the staff started with,                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5734.0) |
|    5740 |  5744 | but at the end of the day there's only two governing bodies, them and us.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5740.0) |
|    5744 |  5753 | So with all due respect to the staff, it's the recommendation coming from the other legislative body to us is really the one that matters the most.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5744.0) |
|    5753 |  5758 | That's what the statute says, that you have to get the Planning Commission's recommendation before you act.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5753.0) |
|    5758 |  5762 | Now you can take whatever information you like, including staff recommendations,                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5758.0) |
|    5762 |  5767 | but the one that you have to have is the Planning Commission's recommendation.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5762.0) |
|    5767 |  5769 | So I'm confused, Commissioner Skidmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5767.0) |
|    5769 |  5777 | Okay, hold on one second.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5769.0) |
|    5777 |  5784 | Okay, let's go look at your agenda for item 2A23SP.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5777.0) |
|    5784 |  5786 | Let me make sure that that's correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5784.0) |
|    5786 |  5791 | Somebody sent me a mock-up of what we were doing here.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5786.0) |

|    5803 |  5805 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5803.0) |
|    5805 |  5812 | What she did, okay, if you look at 2A23SP.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5805.0) |
|    5813 |  5816 | Okay, that would be it then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5813.0) |
|    5816 |  5821 | Yes, what she's saying we could do, they could put, and I'll just read it,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5816.0) |

|    5828 |  5834 | because it's a logical extension of the development pattern by a vote of 12-0.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5828.0) |
|    5834 |  5840 | Then she goes in and lists the property address and that the applicant is listed at the end.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5834.0) |
|    5840 |  5847 | It says Graham Corporation Applicant, Commission District 7.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5840.0) |
|    5847 |  5849 | Is that a little bit easier to understand?                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5847.0) |
|    5849 |  5858 | So you're basically taking out the applicant's request and only including Planning Commission action.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5849.0) |
|    5858 |  5859 | Correct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5858.0) |
|    5859 |  5862 | That's it because it doesn't really matter what the applicant's requesting.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5859.0) |
|    5862 |  5870 | It's what they've all, the Planning Commission has actually presented to us.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5862.0) |
|    5870 |  5875 | Respectfully, Commissioner, that's really not, I see what you're saying.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5870.0) |
|    5875 |  5882 | What I'm saying is that at the end of the day it is still the request of the applicant that you're acting on.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5875.0) |
|    5882 |  5887 | You're getting a recommendation from the Planning Commission, but that is not binding on this commission.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5882.0) |
|    5887 |  5892 | And if you leave out or minimize what the applicant's asking for,                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5887.0) |
|    5892 |  5898 | then you're basically elevating the Planning Commission over the applicant.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5892.0) |
|    5898 |  5902 | I mean, this is a legislative action.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5898.0) |
|    5902 |  5909 | All that this body's required to do in amending the zoning ordinance is get the recommendation of the Planning Commission.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5902.0) |
|    5909 |  5914 | After that, this commission can do what it likes.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5909.0) |
|    5914 |  5917 | But I think it's a bit of a problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5914.0) |
|    5917 |  5920 | Like on the first one, this is the request of Robert T. Whitehead.                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5917.0) |
|    5920 |  5922 | It's not the Planning Commission's request.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5920.0) |
|    5922 |  5924 | It's Mr. Whitehead's request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5922.0) |
|    5924 |  5929 | Now he may, this commission may be inclined to give him what he wants or it might not,                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5924.0) |
|    5929 |  5931 | but at the end of the day it's still his request.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5929.0) |
|    5931 |  5933 | It's not the Planning Commission's request.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5931.0) |
|    5933 |  5941 | So respectfully, I think that would be a problem to just list or even primarily list                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5933.0) |
|    5941 |  5950 | the Planning Commission's recommendation over that, what the property owner's actually asking for.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5941.0) |
|    5950 |  5955 | Okay, that's one of the good reasons why we have these discussions.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5950.0) |

|    5960 |  5962 | Just a quick question then.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5960.0) |

|    5965 |  5970 | Because I do feel like that's important information in the caption.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5965.0) |
|    5970 |  5972 | From a legal point of view, sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5970.0) |
|    5972 |  5975 | Just, you know, these captions are going to get pretty long.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5972.0) |
|    5975 |  5981 | But there's nothing legally wrong with that.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5975.0) |
|    5981 |  5988 | So to move forward with this, if we wanted to get their caption on there,                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5981.0) |
|    5988 |  5995 | can we just do that administratively through the chairman?                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=5988.0) |

|    6007 |  6010 | Yeah, I guess if you just ask Dory to include the planning staff's recommendation,                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6007.0) |
|    6010 |  6013 | she'd be happy to do it, I imagine.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6010.0) |

|    6018 |  6019 | Amy, do you have something to add?                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6018.0) |
|    6019 |  6022 | I just have a question if it's okay to ask.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6019.0) |
|    6022 |  6023 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6022.0) |
|    6023 |  6033 | So if we were to add staff's recommendation, would that also be read into the record?                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6023.0) |
|    6033 |  6038 | She still does it because it's still read into the record anyway.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6033.0) |

|    6062 |  6067 | But it would be publicized in the agenda.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6062.0) |
|    6067 |  6068 | It would be written.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6067.0) |
|    6068 |  6071 | Yeah, and I would say that it is part of the packet.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6068.0) |
|    6071 |  6074 | Staff's recommendation is included already in the packet.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6071.0) |
|    6074 |  6075 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6074.0) |

|    6078 |  6079 | Amy and I have had this discussion.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6078.0) |
|    6079 |  6084 | I believe it's in our rules that it comes down, staff recommendation,                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6079.0) |
|    6084 |  6088 | and that's what Amy has to read or just reads.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6084.0) |
|    6088 |  6092 | That could be done by the clerk all at one time,                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6088.0) |
|    6092 |  6097 | and we don't have to ask Amy what staff recommendation was                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6092.0) |
|    6097 |  6100 | because it's already read into the minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6097.0) |
|    6100 |  6105 | More important to me is Amy or Michelle or whoever,                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6100.0) |
|    6105 |  6113 | when I asked a question, what happened, why did they vote 8-6 or whatever,                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6105.0) |
|    6113 |  6116 | that you really know why it was 8-6.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6113.0) |
|    6116 |  6122 | That's more important than reading, having Amy or whoever it is,                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6116.0) |
|    6122 |  6125 | Michelle, I guess, now read it into the record.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6122.0) |
|    6125 |  6127 | You follow what I'm saying?                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6125.0) |
|    6127 |  6130 | Well, just let the clerk read the whole thing into the record,                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6127.0) |
|    6130 |  6132 | and we've got that solved,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6130.0) |
|    6132 |  6136 | and then hopefully when I asked Michelle, I said,                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6132.0) |
|    6136 |  6140 | did you all discuss commercial when he really,                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6136.0) |
|    6140 |  6145 | that would be a better fit than GC or whatever?                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6140.0) |
|    6145 |  6148 | We'll be good at that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230320?start=6145.0) |
