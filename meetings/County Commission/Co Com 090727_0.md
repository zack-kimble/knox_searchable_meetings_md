| 0:01:33| I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Sam, what did you do to make your side of the room not want to sit near you or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| Just like I said earlier, yesterday was Sunday, so I did bathe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| I think Commissioner Broyles is still in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=104)|
| 0:01:48| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=108)|
| 0:01:50| Fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Is that legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| We have 15 commissioners that are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| Sixteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| Sixteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Lieutenant, would you like to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| Lieutenant, would you like to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| Pledge of Allegiance, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=144)|
| 0:02:35| I need a motion for the approval of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=158)|

| 0:02:47| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| Swear in the name of the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| Anyone present who intends to appear before this body this afternoon to give testimony, please stand or raise your hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| and give...Mr. Shope, you'd likewise have to be sworn, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=185)|
| 0:03:12| I solemnly swear that the testimony you'll give here today will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Those present have been sworn, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| Number five, clerk, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=204)|
| 0:03:26| Consideration of suspension revocation of beer permit for the following establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| the Corner Market 7512 Sevierville Pike, LGA Enterprise Incorporated, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| Second offense deferred from May 26, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=216)|
| 0:03:44| I'm Steve Shope and I'm here for him on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| Could I get your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| My address is 620 West Hill Avenue, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| This is not a second offense for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| This is a new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| He just acquired the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| He had a charge that was pending, and that charge was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| So he comes before the beer board with no charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| I think there was a charge with the old owner, but this is a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Mr. Jarrett, was this a...now, last time it was the applicant applying with a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Is this the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| We've got an applicant for that corner market, an application also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| Now, is that the guy that was cited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Was it dismissed upon payment of cost or was it just dismissed outright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| It's just dismissed outright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Ms. Brumman, is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| I have a copy of the judge's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| I can confirm that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| I guess along the same lines as Commissioner Anders, you know, we have here for a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=292)|
| 0:05:02| We've got on here a deferred application and then an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Are these all the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Are they different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| I think it's all the same application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| I don't know how it got on there three times, but it's a new owner, and he had applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| and while he was training and working there, he was cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| He was cited as an employee of the previous owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| He wasn't really working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| He was just trained to take over the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| I don't think he was really working for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| But that was dismissed by the judge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So really the only thing we should have before us is an application for his beer license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| So we really don't need here under deferred applications and applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| I believe it should just be here as deferred application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| I believe, according to the clerk's records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| the initial application was under LGA, which no longer exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| and now he is applying under his own name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| So we should really just have 7C, and we need to get rid of both 5A and 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| I'll make a motion that we withdraw 5A and 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| We have a motion to withdraw 5A and 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| 7A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| 7A has been the applicant wants it to be deferred until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=395)|
| 0:06:43| 7B, the applicant wants it withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| So we have 7C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| I'll make a motion that we go ahead and defer and withdraw those two items as per what the chairman has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| Properly moved and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| And 7C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Well, TAKURI, T-A-K-R-U-R-I, Corner Market and Deli, 7512 Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=424)|
| 0:07:13| on and off premise, formerly the Corner Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| Is the owner here, Mr. Shope, the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| No, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| I'm here on his behalf if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| As you're aware, we have a series of questions we'll normally ask of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Are you empowered to answer those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| And do you have that information that you can answer them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| Is the board willing to accept that as the agent of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| We've had that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=465)|
| 0:07:46| We have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| You say we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| We've had lawyers come before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Is it some, Mr. Hall Director, is that permissible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| I just wanted to defer to the board before we move forward since it hasn't occurred since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| Mr. Shope, can you attest to this board whether or not any of the employees of this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| have been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession, sale, manufacture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| or transportation of intoxicating liquor or any crime involving moral turpitude within the past ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Has beer ever been sold to this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Is there an outstanding license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| So that has been surrendered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| The application, is it for on or off premises or both?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| Off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| Off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| It's marked as on off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| It is marked on and off, but he told me this morning all he wants is off premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| Do you agree with that, Mr. Shope, as the agent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| Off premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| And your relationship to the owner is counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| Does he own the premises or does he lease them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| He's leased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=534)|
| 0:08:55| Do you know who else has an ownership interest in this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| He's the only owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| And he's going to operate it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Can you attest that this gentleman is familiar with the beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| and do you agree that he'll conduct this business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| And I advise you to so inform him of that because if he does not, obviously, he will incur penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| Do you know whether or not he's completed his server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| I can answer that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Then I guess you'll concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| We're now going to hear from the various departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Mr. Shope, Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| I'll defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Is this gentleman any relation to the previous owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I also notice that he lives in Chattanooga, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Is he going to play an active role in running this business, or is this simply an investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| No, he's here working in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| He's working in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| He's commuting from Chattanooga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| I thought he lived in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| His address here, it looks to me like it's Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=604)|
| 0:10:08| He's got a 423 telephone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| It says Chestnut Wood Lane, Chattanooga, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| It goes down to Chattanooga?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| I mean, I've got constituents that work in TBA in Chattanooga and commute that far, so I know it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| It just seems a little odd for a convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| I think he's actually staying up here in that store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| He's living in the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| It has an apartment underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| It has an apartment underneath it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| I used to own that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| It used to have one upstairs and one below, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I used to own the property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Sir, there's a certificate of registration that your client is going to have to give to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Make a motion we approve for off-premises only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=667)|
| 0:11:10| 8A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Discussion and possible action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| Discussion and possible action of QuickShop No. 24-7657 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| Maresco, LLC, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Commissioners, as you're aware, three months ago this matter came before the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| and the commission issued a 120-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Mr. Shope represents the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| He has asked to be put on the agenda today to discuss with the board that penalty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| and I'll defer to Mr. Shope or the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| It's been some time since I've been to the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| I think last time down here Craig's dad, Frank, and maybe Paul's brother, Nookie, were on the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| But, anyway, I got two in the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| So this man, you all got his attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| Daniel Blackburn, he was here and he was suspended for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| He has changed some of the things he's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| And he sent, of course, all his employees go to the training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| The supervisors call the store each day and talk with the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| and tell them to be sure and card everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| There's a sign on the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Now, when you come in, it says everybody will be ID'd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| There's a sign on the cash register that reminds the employee to card everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| and he's had the beer company put name badges that says we ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| So you all got his attention with the 120-day suspension, and we're just asking for some leniency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| He couldn't be here because he's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| It's been three months today that he was suspended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| and we just ask that maybe you reconsider and lift that last 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=770)|
| 0:13:01| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=781)|
| 0:13:03| Mr. Shope, I know you weren't here when he was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| I listened to the tape, and I was, I guess, the ringleader of that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=786)|
| 0:13:17| He came up here with a nonchalant attitude, didn't care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| and really he figured it in as a cost of doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| and told us that what do you want him to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| that he pays his employees a certain amount of money and that's all he gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| and he can't get a good employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=812)|
| 0:13:35| Well, all I'm asking is him to look and not sell beer to anybody under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| It's not hard to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| I think you got his attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Well, that was my goal was to get his attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| and also to stop selling beer to the kids in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| You got his attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| He's changed, and he's looking at it completely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| He actually feels like maybe he handled it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| I don't think he's the best, maybe, public speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| It had nothing to do with public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| It was what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| He was so nonchalant that he could care less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| It was a cost of doing business to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| And I'm not going to make a motion to lift the suspension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| because I think that if we do that, we send the rest of the merchants in Knox County that we don't mean business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| And I think getting his attention was what my intention was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| and my intention is also to prevent him from ever selling alcohol again to underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| Well, just in response, I'd say you did get his attention, and he is trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| And sometimes the people you employ, it can be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| And 90 days, and these are tough economic times, especially on these small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| And I would just ask that you reconsider and lift the last 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| He wanted to be here today, but he had to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| Mr. Jarrett suggested we put it on today, and this is as quick as we could get it, and he's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=896)|
| 0:15:02| But he would be here to verify the things I've said to you if he were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| Too late now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Yeah, I wasn't here that day myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| I was at another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| But I really think that Commissioner Anders and this board did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| I'm typically very pro-business, but I saw the tape, and, I mean, he didn't care at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=922)|
| 0:15:31| And also, now this is hearsay, but the rumors that I'm hearing in the community that his staff has been bragging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| oh, they're not going to do this, we'll have it back before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| And I feel like that based on what's been said in the community, that people have said up and down Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| that it will be perceived as weakness if this commission doesn't do exactly what they said they were going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| So mine and Brad's district, I don't intend to ask that this be lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| I know we've gotten his attention, but like I said, it just, you know, the talk up and down the highway is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| oh, they can't do that, we're going to have it back before then, we're going to show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Well, I think we need to show them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| I would agree with my colleagues that I'm not going to vote to back it up another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| But I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| You said he calls every day to remind everybody to ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| He's not calling this location, is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Because he can't sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| No, his supervisors are now calling each of the stores they work at and reminding employees daily to check everybody's ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| How many stores does he have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| There's several, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| He's got four in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Okay, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Okay, so you're talking about the other stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Yeah, he's not selling beer at this store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Could you put in writing for us and send it to us exactly what he's doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| I think it would be helpful for us to have that on file if you wouldn't mind doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| I will have him dictate it and sign it since he's the one doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| I was here that day that it happened, and I've known Steve for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| but I have to agree with my other colleagues, particularly with having children and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| But he basically was very nonchalant, I think very rude to the beer board by saying that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1043)|
| 0:17:32| he would just have to go out of business if he lost his beer license for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| Well, it's been 90 days, and obviously he's still in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| So this is a very strong statement that I want people in Knox County to know that this beer board is serious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1060)|
| 0:17:48| about people who sell to underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| So I'm going to have to go along with my colleagues and stick to this 120 days to make sure we get his attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| and everybody else's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| I'd like to go ahead, unless the commissioners want to, and make a motion to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Properly moved that we deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Is there anything else that needs to come before this beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| We had Commissioner Brown, didn't he have an item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| I withdraw my motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| You've got to act fast, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| I was reaching for the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Two things, and I don't have the one, but you all got a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| The second thing is that I think we need to think about adding, and we'll try to have more details next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1133)|
| 0:19:02| Right now, once they're certified in the county to serve, that certification is forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| Now, the city has a recertification program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| My idea would be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| I'd hate to have them go back through that whole $40 or $50 program each time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| but if we could come up with a refresher course that they would have to take every three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1160)|
| 0:19:29| I've already spoken with the Sheriff's Department and the Metropolitan Drug Commission in the U.K.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| and we're going to try to get together and work up something in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1174)|
| 0:19:37| where there would be possibly a PowerPoint presentation that would involve showing some serious accidents where alcohol was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| Something that we can do to reinforce to these folks, you know, that, hey, that's what I need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1186)|
| 0:19:52| because I could be causing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| So I want you all to kind of keep that in mind, and we'll be working on that this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| and try to have that ready for next month then to have a recertification period for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1198)|
| 0:20:06| Certainly, if it's permissible by law, I can draft some legislation, or if you prefer to go to another source, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| Well, we were just going to try to work up a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| Oh, an educational program first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| An educational program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| For approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1218)|
| 0:20:25| And the other issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| You feed your head, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Well, the other, I don't have it with me, so it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| I do, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Is that regarding the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| If I could, Mr. Chairman, the city of Knoxville has as part of their code the following language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1236)|
| 0:20:41| The board may revoke or suspend any permit for the sale of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| when it is shown that the permittee is delinquent in paying any fee or privilege tax, the payment of which is required by statute or ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| The board may also revoke or suspend any permit when the permittee fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| or refuses timely to provide information which the permittee is required to provide by statute or ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| They've outlined that in their ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| So in a nutshell, what they're saying is if you overprivilege tax to, say, the county clerk, it's unpaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| That could relate back to the beer board, and your license can be in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| I don't see any legal impediment to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| If the board wants me to amend the ordinance for future reference to review, I can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| You know, I passed an ordinance here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| It's been several years ago, and I thought it was supposed to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| You know, I talked to you here not too long ago about a case that had come up, and you said we couldn't void our license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| that Knox County is not to do any business with people that owe us any kind of tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| When they owe us, we should not be rewarding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| And I'm sure that the people here that were on the commission at that time thought that took care of that too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| but apparently it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Well, I'd have to review the ordinance to which you're speaking and see if it relates back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| but this is specific to a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| You've got to remember a beer license permit is permitted by state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| so it's not a matter of them doing actual business with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| I understand your philosophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| but what I'm saying is I think we can relate it back if that's the commission's will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| I see this as another way that we can have a little better control over who is doing the selling and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1334)|
| 0:22:23| So I would make a motion that we adopt that and make it part of our beer laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| I thought what was going to happen was you were going to go back and craft some language for an ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1353)|
| 0:22:40| Yes, you'd have to have an ordinance change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| My direction would be to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I don't think we need a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| I think we just need to give you direction to give us an ordinance change for us to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| Yes, sir, that I would bring to the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| That's what I meant to say when we passed an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| Well, then I'll make that change in my motion that we direct our law director to write up that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Commissioner Schaaf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| My comments were just in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| I've had numerous or several conversations with UK Miner who works for us and, of course, for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| And he's pointed this out to me as I think he has other members of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| And I think it's an area we can be very to do the best job we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1399)|
| 0:23:27| We need to tighten it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| And I support Mr. Brown's motion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| And thank you, UK, for pointing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| Move to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| We're ready to start our July 9th county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1432)|
| 0:23:59| Ms. Brawls, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| While we're waiting on my distinguished colleagues, may I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| She has presented two honoraries involving the Fulton High School and the Girl Scouts at Tenassee Gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| Are either of those groups here today for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Girl Scouts are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Girl Scouts are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| We'll make sure you get recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| As far as the Fulton, anybody hear from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| All right, we'll probably deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Commissioner Hammond, Commissioner Harmon, you might want to take it off consent and move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| Yes, I'd like to see the Girl Scouts item removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| We'll get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Commissioner Brawls called me this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Before we have our devotion, she wanted to let everyone know that Ray Abbott had a head injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| and he's in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| So during our devotion, we can think about him in our prayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| Our devotion this month will be led by Commissioner Brad Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| pledged allegiance by Commissioner Finbar Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| I'm always forgetting about roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1520)|

| 0:25:31| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1532)|

| 0:25:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1540)|

| 0:25:44| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1544)|

| 0:25:46| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Eighteen commissioners are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| On devotional, once again, will be led by Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| pledged allegiance by Commissioner Finbar Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| Lord, we thank you today for what you've given to us as a country and a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| You've blessed us immensely, and we appreciate the freedom that we live under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I ask that you be with Ray and help the doctors diagnose his condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| and lay your healing hand upon him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Be with us today as we have our meeting and help us put Knox County before ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| I ask you for your wisdom and guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| In Jesus' name I pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Please rise and face the flag and render the salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1606)|
| 0:27:01| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| Make motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| For you, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Number 503 can remain on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| but I wish it recorded that I abstain because I work for the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| and should recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Also, I'd like to ask that the item related to the Girl Scouts Tenacity Council be removed from consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1645)|
| 0:27:34| and put toward the top of the agenda so we may properly honor them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| What number is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| That is number 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| Regarding honoring Fulton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I suggest that because no one is here to receive it unless Sarah Priestley is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| I recommend deferring that 30 days until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| What number is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| That is number 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Excuse me, 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| 102 deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| The other item is sort of a personal request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| I don't know if we can adjust the meeting time of zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| It is scheduled at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| At that same time, speaking love to hate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| a community photograph will be taken outside the Tennessee Valley Unitarian Universalist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| I'd love if many of us could be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| If we can't defer at that time to, say, 630 so we could be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| I'd at least like to have some recognition today of that anniversary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| and of the brave people who have stepped forward since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| I think that's all the additions, corrections, alterations I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1722)|
| 0:28:50| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Also to that point, Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| I believe that celebration starts at 7 o'clock at the Unitarian Church, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| So, if at all possible, the members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| if we could see if we might be as brief as possible so some of us could attend that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| that would be a good thing, I think, so in our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| This is a personal privilege also, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| I was wanting to see if we could move the discussion out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Given all of the publicity that surrounded the task force meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| and some of the things that have happened there, my discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| which was number four under the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| I was requesting that we move that to the front somewhere in the front of the agenda if it pleases the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| What page is that on, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| It's on the very last page, page 26, right in front of zoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1789)|
| 0:30:02| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| I'd like to withdraw ordinance 9-7-102 with regards to the wheel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| Also, if I could put on for discussion the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| 902 you want withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Yes, 9-7-102, if I could have that withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| There's a corresponding ordinance that goes with that, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| That is the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1828)|
| 0:30:29| I'm sorry, if I said resolution, I meant to say ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Isn't there a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| I mean, there's a resolution and an ordinance that correspond with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| I don't know that there's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1842)|
| 0:30:44| I think it's just the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| That's on page 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1847)|
| 0:30:48| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1850)|
| 0:30:52| Yes, it's on page 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| And also, can I put a discussion item on about the ethics committee meeting on Wednesday, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1855)|
| 0:31:09| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| Again, add all those that are to be added, that are to be deferred, and withdraw those that will be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1872)|
| 0:31:21| But also, item number 804, I need to recuse myself of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| The law director says that we can, like Commissioner Harmon did, is to keep it on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| But with my vote, I'll be recusing myself on number 804 because it does deal with the Knox County Trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I'd like to defer 7-911 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1906)|
| 0:31:53| That's dealing with the workshop or the committee to work with the council on the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1913)|
| 0:32:01| We have a meeting scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| They are scheduling a meeting, I should say, that may take care of this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| I would like to defer that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| Commissioner Armstrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Yes, I would like to have Resolution 97-919 moved a little closer to the front this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1940)|
| 0:32:28| because it's going to top several people, and I thought we might be able to dispose of it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| You're talking on page, give me the page number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| 919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| And move it to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Just move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1967)|
| 0:33:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| On page 2, Resolution R-09-7-101, I would like to move that off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1984)|
| 0:33:12| and move that up as close to the front as we can because we have our honoree here that we want to introduce to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=1992)|
| 0:33:27| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| I have a resolution that was passed out before you, R-09-7-920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| I would like to move that, if we could, to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| This is something new, but it's a topic that we have talked about several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| I'd like to talk one time in the daylight hours on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| It's always at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| And we want to talk about this to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| and there are some people here that want to testify real quick and move them on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| To be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| To be added, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Add it and move it to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2039)|
| 0:34:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2040)|
| 0:34:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| I just want to make sure that, you know, there's been some allegations made against me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| I want to make sure that I'll have an opportunity to present a defense today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| and I'll probably need about 15 minutes or less to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| So I just will ask for that indulgence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2061)|
| 0:34:23| and I'm going to try to keep my comments brief on the other items that we talk about today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| because I know I will be asking for some time when that discussion comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Yes, you'll notice on your desk that William Daniels, who is the chairman of the BZA, left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| It's really a little bit of a discussion about an item that we need to discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| and he's asked that we move this up so he doesn't have to wait four hours until we get to some of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2089)|
| 0:34:58| It deals with having different zoning areas on agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2098)|
| 0:35:10| Yes, it would be added to the agenda and then moved up if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| He's here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| I also want to put a discussion item on dealing with the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2120)|
| 0:35:30| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2130)|
| 0:35:40| My agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| I need a motion for a consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=2145)|

| 0:54:53| and we appreciate and thank you so much for all your leadership and raising future young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3293)|
| 0:55:03| And we just want you to know that we very much appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| And I'll tell you what, I had to pretty much twist his arm to get him to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| I thought I was going to have to go to his front door in Fountain City and hand him this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| because he's a very humble man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| So it is with great joy that we honor him as the John Heatherly Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3320)|
| 0:55:34| I would like to thank Commissioner Carringer and the commission for this great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| I consider myself a very fortunate individual to have been able to spend my working days and career in what I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3338)|
| 0:55:48| I'm very blessed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3349)|
| 0:56:02| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| honoring the recipients of the 2009 Girl Scouts of Tansy Council Gold Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| This is resolution 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Eight-oh to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3373)|

| 0:56:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3379)|

| 0:56:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3381)|
| 0:56:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3383)|
| 0:56:27| Commissioner Smith, would you like to have it read into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| If you would, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| And if the young ladies would come forward, we'd like to recognize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award in girl scouting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| symbolizing outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| career planning, and personal development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Whereas the Girl Scouts are the USA and the world's preeminent organization solely dedicated to girls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| and whereas through the Girl Scouts, accepting and nurturing the environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| girls are able to build character and to develop qualities and skills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| that will benefit them throughout their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| Whereas the Girl Scout Award is a distinction that represents many hours of hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| service, and dedication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| and whereas it is an accomplishment achieved by a very small percentage of those who participate in scouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3429)|
| 0:57:15| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| The Knox County Commission hereby honors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| and commends the 2009 recipients of the prestigious Girl Scouts of Tansy Council Gold Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| namely Alicia, Emily, Kelsey, Sarah, Stephanie, Meredith, Lupa, Lynn, Alicia, Caitlin, Annie, Sarah, Ray,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3448)|
| 0:57:37| Stephanie, Kelly, Hannah, Carolyn, Emily, Theresa, and Catherine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the above-named recipients of the Gold Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| and after its passage as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| This was just handed to me three or four minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Commissioner Boyles was supposed to be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| I think hopefully she's watching on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| I have served on the Girl Scout Board of Directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| and presently serve on the Boy Scout Board, so I'm very familiar with the scouting program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| We have some of our leadership here from the Tansy Girl Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| But, ladies, I just want to mention to you all that what was read into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| and we've got one of these for each of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| what you all have learned in scouting you're going to remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| and you're going to apply in your everyday life the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| You'll always remember your leaders and you'll always remember what you learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3509)|
| 0:58:34| And what percentage of these girls that start Girl Scouts achieve this award?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| About 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Same way with Boy Scouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| 2% of the boys are an Eagle, 5% of the girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| And this is over how many counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| This is over just Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| We have over 40 girls in 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| This is our Knox County representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| So out of Knox County, 18 of you all are the only ones that achieve this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| So that's like getting your master's in scouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| So congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3547)|

| 0:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3577)|
| 1:00:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| This is a discussion item from William Daniels on the different zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| in the agricultural zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| Mr. Daniels, do you have some more copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| We have to have a couple for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3612)|
| 1:00:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| William, you've got more copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3628)|
| 1:00:57| Good afternoon, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Could you name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| William Daniels, 1505 Botsford Drive, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| As you all know, I'm the Chairman of the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| and we've continued to see more and more discussion coming to us, appeals, on the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3672)|
| 1:01:22| And I know when I was a commissioner, we had begun to deal with one issue before the August elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3682)|
| 1:01:30| and we had pushed that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| Well, that one issue came back to us again several times on the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3692)|
| 1:01:39| and I think it helped all of us to see that we need more clarification in the agricultural zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3699)|
| 1:01:47| This past month, we had two issues that dealt with agricultural zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| and there's more to come before us probably next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| So there's obviously, as you can tell by the letter, in May, I believe, actually it would have been in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3716)|
| 1:02:07| I believe the Commission asked for MPC to write some clarification for the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| for the Commission to take a look at and decide if it was something they wanted to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| Those changes failed because of a lack of a second, so it was never even voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| But this is something that has the potential to create a lot of lawsuits for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| as far as trying to clarify what the agricultural zoning is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| There are some good language in it, but I don't think the Board of Zoning Appeals agrees unanimously that we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3757)|
| 1:02:46| We need some direction from the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| My proposal is this, that Knox County Commission place two people on a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3769)|
| 1:02:58| two from Board of Zoning Appeals and one from MPC, to go over the agricultural zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| and what they had proposed to you before and see if we can bring something before this body to be voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| that will give our citizens a clear understanding of what can be allowed in agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| And if you look at the agricultural zone, you can have anything from a rock crusher to a green waste site to raising hogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3796)|
| 1:03:26| You know, you can do a little bit of anything in that agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| And I think that's a little broad, and I realize some of those uses would be under use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| but this is something that needs to be tightened up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| It's not tight enough, and what we don't want is Grant Rosenberg's department to be flooded with people questioning this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3819)|
| 1:03:51| It needs to be something that's in stone, and right now I think it's extremely gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3831)|
| 1:04:01| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3841)|
| 1:04:06| William, I just had one question on this over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| One question on this is that if we do go to some sort of agricultural 1A, 1B, 1C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| and we have land that right now is intended for agricultural use, you know, raising corn or pigs or whatever we're doing on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3855)|
| 1:04:25| and it goes to one of these other uses, would that zoning change, if we set up this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| would that zoning change require those to come back in front of the county commission since it is a zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| or would it be something that would still be a use on review but better get guidelines for the MPC and the BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| Richard, as we talked earlier, I think that that's something that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| it would have to come back under use on review, but I wouldn't see it necessarily having to come before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| It would be more of a zoning issue as opposed to a legal matter for them just to have the proper zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| And I'm not so certain that A, B, and C under the agricultural zoning isn't the right way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| and maybe the C is whenever you're into agriculture but it's into the commercial side of agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| You know, maybe there's a quasi zone there under agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3912)|
| 1:05:20| I guess what I'm asking, though, if it's actually a zoning change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| if you have something that's C that's general agriculture and you want to make it agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| or commercial, that would be a zoning change that would have to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| That's not a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| That would be my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Well, Director, would that be the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| I'd have to look at the code before I can just extemporaneously answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| But generally that sounds the way it would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| Thanks, Richard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Mr. Law Director, how many lawsuits have we had filed against us with regards to agricultural zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| I haven't seen any in recent memory, but I can only go back about a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| How many lawsuits have we had filed against us with regards to the term contractor or landscaping contractor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3970)|
| 1:06:17| In terms of the lawsuit being predicated on the vagueness of the language, none that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| William, I guess my point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| We've spent an awful lot of time on this whole thing about landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| I mean, we've had public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| We've had meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| We've had votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| This thing has gone on months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I think what I would like to do is, rather than form another committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| is for you folks on BZA to give us specifically what you would like to see done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| and then let us take that and then, you know, perhaps consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| But to go through, again, this whole landscaping thing, that's not, you know, I mean, to me it's been decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| And so, again, I'm sensitive to what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4014)|
| 1:06:58| Having served with you on the Board of Zoning Appeals, I know these issues come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| But I also know that this whole deal about landscaping has just been, in many cases, cussed as well as discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| And it's just gone on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| And we have finally voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| So if there is something specific that you think that we could do to help clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| and make it better, I'm willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| But I don't know that forming another committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| and going into this whole thing again is going to be that productive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| But, again, that's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| I'm willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Well, Commissioner Hammond, I think that when MPC brought back clarified guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| I think that's what they were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| I think that's what the commission had asked them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| But it was never even voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| It failed for lack of a second to even be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| And I think those guidelines are what BZA needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| The reason that it wasn't seconded is because I think the majority or everyone here agreed that they weren't in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| And so I think that that's the message that was sent was we didn't like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| And so, again, if there's something specific, I'm willing to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4076)|
| 1:08:01| But to get into this whole landscaping thing again, I'm wondering what direction do we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4081)|
| 1:08:06| how do we do this without getting into the whole hornet's nest again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| If I may, I'd like for Grant to speak for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| Grant Rosenberg, Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4095)|
| 1:08:17| I think what would be helpful with regard to the landscaping issue is what was before you a few months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4097)|
| 1:08:24| were some amendments to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| And what would help us would be to define landscape contractors as a use and put it into a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4106)|
| 1:08:34| I think the controversy was putting it into the agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| And this body has overwhelmingly said that that's not where it belongs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| So let's put it in the commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| It just needs to be put into the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| It needs to be defined and it needs to be put into a zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| So my suggestion would be, specific suggestion would be to define it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| and put it into the commercial zone as a use that's permitted in a commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| Right now it's not in the zoning ordinance at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| And that's where the definitions are open to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| Thank you, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Mr. Daniels, when you get together, I'll be happy to help if you need any help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| I understand what Commissioner Hammond was saying, but if you want to come back in need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| I'd be happy to help with that and especially would have Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| And if you get MPC, I would get your supervisors from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| Ask for supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| With the pleasure of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I'd like to hear from this gentleman here, I think, who's wanting to speak, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| I mean, if the commission agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| I've been dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| I need your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4184)|
| 1:09:45| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4185)|
| 1:09:46| I live at 5316 West Beaver Creek Road, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4186)|
| 1:09:52| I've been dealing with this for probably a year and five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| landscaping deal with my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| This has been drawed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| It's still drawed out, even though the BZA has denied them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| This board has denied them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| We have a court that has denied him, but he's still in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| He's 100% still in operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| And we have been dealing with this and dealing with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| and I do agree with Mr. Daniels that it needs to be put in a specific zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| and the zone should be commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| It should not be in the ag zone whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| Everybody is worried about the little mom-and-pop operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| the one or two people that have their own little landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| their own little lawnmower, their own little trailer and one truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| That's already defined as home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| So what we need to do is take commercial landscapers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| and commercial contractors and put them in a zone that they belong in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| which is the commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| The ag zone is for agriculture, and it's not made and designed for commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| And then they bring up the MPC, come in when they want to do a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| or they want to do this and they want to do that or let them have this or give them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| It don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| It does not work because we've got that across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| Demand is not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| It doesn't work when you give them this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| So the best thing to do is define it, put it in commercial zone where they belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| and the mom-and-pop operation will handle it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| Then I don't have an issue with doing that, William, as long as it's defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| and as long as you have something specific, and I think you've outlined that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4296)|
| 1:11:41| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| Do we have authority when we do rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| Here's my fear of putting it in commercial is that a guy gets his property zoned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| for a landscaping company that his neighbors are okay with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| and then he sells his property zoned commercial to someone else who's going to put something in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| that his neighbors may not be okay with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| Is there any way that we can zone something commercial for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| yet have it to where it's only commercial for landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| and that any other uses would have to have a separate type zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| maybe a commercial greenery or maybe an agricultural land with a commercial overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4343)|
| 1:12:33| something to where it expires?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| Because what I'm afraid of is you're going to have someone that will get property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| and then sell that to someone else and you'll have a full-blown business next to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| When a property comes before MPC, they can get a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| a conditional rezoning that would be specific to a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4373)|
| 1:13:03| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion that we do the committee that Mr. Daniels has suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| two commissioners, two BZA and one MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| And Mr. Smith has agreed to serve on that, so I would ask that he be considered for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| I'll make that a formal motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| How many people do you need from the county commission, William?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| I think two would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| One is fine with me and we can put John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| I would be happy to be on that because I've been concerned about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| so I'd be happy to serve with Commissioner Smith on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| Thank you, Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Two commissioners would be commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| I would suggest taking commissioners that served formally on the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| I think they'd have a little bit more knowledge about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| I formally served on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| I think the other one should be from that too, Mr. Harmon, is what I'm trying to say, because this came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4428)|
| 1:13:59| I think that Larry's experience serving on the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| The two commissioners I'm on a point of, Commissioner Harmon and Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| because Larry does have, he was chairman of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| And he served on BZA too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| The two are Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Make sure that's Mark Harmon, not Ivan Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| They can select their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| So that's in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Chairman, what I would like to do is use John Schoonmaker, who's my co-chairman on the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| and also Marcus Chatty, who's an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| Sir, since we have two commissioners, over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Ensure you inform Joe Lee of your meetings, because it would be considered a sunshine board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| William, when I talk about supervisors, I'm talking supervisor and hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| I see Mark out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| I mean, if Mark Dawson wants to, that's fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| So you all know who to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4509)|
| 1:15:17| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4522)|
| 1:15:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| On page 26, discussion item number four, discussion regarding the events which occurred at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| public meeting of the Joint City-County Task Force on Ridge, Slope, and Hillside Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| and Protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4539)|
| 1:15:47| Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| No action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| No action taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Last week at both the finance and the intergovernmental committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| I chose to detail what happened at the Ridge Top and Steep Slope Task Force meetings on the previous week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4574)|
| 1:16:26| One was in South Knoxville at South Dole Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| and then the other one was at the Carnes Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| I went through the details of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| I thought that was necessary because the conduct of Mr. Lambert at both of the meetings was so abhorrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4596)|
| 1:16:44| and out of bounds that the commission should know of these actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4604)|
| 1:16:56| I thought that in both meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| Mr. Lambert acted in direct interference of what we'd consider a democratic process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| the effort to get information out to the community and receive information back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| I thought it was a premeditated attempt to derail some of the mission of the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4635)|
| 1:17:22| and it should be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| So, therefore, I addressed the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I did tell the committees that I wouldn't go back through the whole thing again today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4647)|
| 1:17:36| since everybody's heard it already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| but I would report back what happened at the subsequent meeting or the meeting last Thursday at Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| which Mr. Lambert had threatened to disrupt that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| So, that's all I'm doing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I'm going to report the activities of that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| and then I'll leave it up to the board if there's someone who wishes to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| It's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| I think that, in my reason being, I feel like my investment of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| and my proximity to this whole thing has caused me to be very emotional on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| and so I just don't think it's appropriate for me to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| If the recommendation comes, if the board feels like it's appropriate to censure, and I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| I mean, I think at the very least it's appropriate to censure Mr. Lambert for the kind of behavior he's had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| but it's not appropriate for me to make that because of my closeness to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| And so all I have left to do then is to report to you what happened since the committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4719)|
| 1:18:47| and indeed after the committee meeting I had numerous calls from all of the media, TV, and radio to speak about the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4727)|
| 1:18:57| I told each of them that I would not speak about Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| I did not choose to do that, and I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4741)|
| 1:19:08| I had maybe one interview about the process of the meeting on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4748)|
| 1:19:13| which, by the way, went very smoothly after I think after Mr. Jarrett and I met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4753)|
| 1:19:25| and talked about what had happened and possibly tightened up some of the process for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4765)|
| 1:19:35| The meeting went well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| Mr. Lambert chose not to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| He had the opportunity, as anybody does who attended the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| he did not speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| And just as in the other two meetings that he did not attend, I thought the meeting went well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4784)|
| 1:19:51| The dialogue was well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| We took comments and questions from the audience, and we received some good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4792)|
| 1:20:00| and I thought we exchanged good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| So I think that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4803)|
| 1:20:09| Mr. Lambert apparently spent the week doing sort of the opposite of me in terms of media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4809)|
| 1:20:17| He used a lot of attempts apparently to what I call spin this towards a personal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| I don't think it's a personal issue at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| I don't consider Mr. Lambert my enemy in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| I admire some of the things that he does and some of his abilities as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| but I do not condone his behavior in any way and the way that he's acted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| and behaved in regards to the task force and those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| So there it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| I don't have anything further to say unless there's other questions from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| A lot's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| A lot's been written about what happened at those two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| and some of what Mr. Norman has said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| I'm a passionate debater, and I debated passionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| A lot of it has been blown way out of proportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| At the South Knoxville meeting, I was recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| I used an analogy that probably I shouldn't have, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| I said that what I was afraid of is that someday this commission was going to take some action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| that was going to destroy someone financially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| and that one of my fears is that someone's liable to come and shoot us all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| I should not have said that, not with what has gone on in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| Someone tried to shoot me once, and that was an extremely scary situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| and I probably should have used a different analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| The point that I was trying to make is that we make decisions that affect people's lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| and people's livelihood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| and we need to really strongly consider the action that we take and the effect on the individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4926)|
| 1:22:14| At the Carnes meeting, I felt like I was disrespected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| There's a courtesy that we as elected officials generally show each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| I'm holding a meeting and a state representative or another county commissioner attends it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| and they say, I'd like to address something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Generally, I show them a bit of professional courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| An issue came up about the previous night's storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| and that day I had been out inspecting retention ponds and storm water systems that had failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4958)|
| 1:22:46| Mr. Ivan Harmon can be my witness to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4966)|
| 1:22:50| I think we were knee-deep in mud together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| And I wanted to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| I wanted to find out exactly where she lived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| And I said, Mr. Norman, could I address this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| He put his hand out and said, you need to wait your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| And I got a little angry, and I said, hold on, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| I said, this just isn't going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| I'm not going to get a word in edgewise unless I help co-chair the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| So I stepped in and attempted to help co-chair the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| Some folks there didn't want me to help do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| I sat down after some persuasion, and it was not the right situation that Mr. Norman has described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| I've got a little evidence that I want to share of how out of proportion this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| One is an article by the New Sentinel written the day after the incident in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5020)|
| 1:23:48| This is the only incident, I believe, that was actually witnessed by a reporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| The other reporters were reporting on hearsay after talking with Mr. Norman and some other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| Not a mention about myself is in this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| If this had been the near-riot situation that Mr. Norman described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| then I would have certainly thought that the Knoxville New Sentinel reporter who was present would have taken note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5049)|
| 1:24:16| I also have some video testimony presented by folks that were present at both meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5056)|
| 1:24:21| And, Jolie, if you'll hit play, and I'll hand these out while it's playing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5061)|
| 1:24:26| Victoria, you attended the meeting of the Hilltop and Slope Protection Task Force last Monday night, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| This interview is more about my behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| Was I called on? Was I out of turn when I spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| Or did I speak at the appropriate time for me to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| I thought that you spoke at the appropriate times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| I didn't feel that you were trying to take over the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| I felt like you were provoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| They knew what buttons to push with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| They know your personality type, that you do get keyed up, and you do get on a rant and some long monologues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5099)|
| 1:25:08| But, I mean, I don't think that it prevented anybody from an opportunity to speak or to share what they were feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5108)|
| 1:25:16| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Was I the only person who got loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| No, Joe Holquist also did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| He got pretty loud?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| So I think it was equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| I think that you both...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5129)|
| 1:25:35| Now, Tony Norman was really quiet, but I think the smirk on his face, I think that they knew that that would really get you going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| So he was quietly provoking, I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| Am I correct in assuming that I was not the only one loud, you know, raising my voice in context?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| No, Joe Holquist was the one who started that, and he really got loud, and he got very keyed up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5154)|
| 1:26:01| So he was the one who first brought up that level, and you matched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| And then you got a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Okay. I understand that. I know my faults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| Was I in any way threatening? Was I scary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| Did I look passionate and concerned, or did I look threatening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5177)|
| 1:26:24| No, I didn't feel threatened by you. Of course, I don't feel threatened by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| But you were sitting on the edge of the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| You never stood up, but you were hunched over, and you were talking quite on your rant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| I get on a rant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| I'm a long-time activist here before being on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5198)|
| 1:26:42| Well, I appreciate you taking the time to let me do this interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| and are you okay with this video being shown to the fellow county commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Okay, Lonnie, give me your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Name is Lonnie Harris, 2535 Old Callahan Drive, zip 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| Okay, and you attended both meetings that are in question of the Hilltop and Slope Protection Task Force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| I've attended every meeting they've had so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| And you've witnessed my actions at the two meetings in question, the one in South Knoxville and the one in Collin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5235)|
| 1:27:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| At the one in South Knoxville, I mean, I did raise my voice, I admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| Was I the only one who raised my voice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Tony was in your face as much as you were in his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| I was sitting right beside Tony when it all started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| And it seemed more like a personal thing to me than it did anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Yeah, I think one of your comments were, you know, that smirk on your face says everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| And I've forgotten Joe chimed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Joe gave me a little veiled threat there that in so many words I best keep my mouth shut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| or there wasn't going to be any rezoning of my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| because I had made the comment that I was not in the same situation as people on down the ridge from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5280)|
| 1:28:08| because mine would probably go commercial eventually because I am totally surrounded with commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| And Joe turned around to me and said, how's your zone now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| I said, it's zoned agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| He said, you've got no assurance it will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| Anything will be done for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| I take that as a veiled threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| Okay. I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5308)|
| 1:28:29| My actions there, were they in any way threatening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| I didn't see them as threatening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| I didn't see them any more threatening than if you want to call what Tony did threatening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| You'd both be guilty then, but I didn't see any threatening part on either one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| It was a discourse between the two of you, and you all are on opposite sides of an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5323)|
| 1:28:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| Had I been recognized when I spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5330)|
| 1:28:52| That I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| I think you had, yeah, you had to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| Now, at the Carnes meeting, and again, I admit that I probably did not act quite appropriately there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| but was it the riot situation that Mr. Norman has described in the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| I don't know what a riot situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| I didn't see anything threatening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| I didn't see any possibility of any cars being turned over or any chairs being thrown or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5357)|
| 1:29:24| I saw some people who wanted you to sit down, and they were yelling, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| sit down, shut up, which you did do eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Now, it's been suggested that Mr. Norman has suggested that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5372)|
| 1:29:38| that he was worried that those people might get violent toward me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| Did those folks look in any way violent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| or did they just simply look like they were passionately debating an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| They were passionately debating an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| They had some issues to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| They had damage on their property due to some irresponsible development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Well, anything you want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| We've got some serious issues here as far as rights and who has rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5402)|
| 1:30:12| and it seems to me that this little commission that they've gotten together has been stacked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| and the landowners have no representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| I think that we need to rethink this and reform the committee with some representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| at least 50 percent of the people who are going to be affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Okay, Diane, what's your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| My name is Diane Collette, and I live at 2319 O'Callaghan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| Okay, and you attended the meeting at the Carnes Community Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Okay, and, of course, you saw what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| Was it the situation that was described in the paper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| No, it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| It was very much exaggerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| Mr. Lambert did not use any vulgar language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| He was not out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| The only thing he did was to stand up while a lady was talking to address the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| that he thought that Mr. Lambert was going to overlook, or Mr. Norman was going to overlook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5477)|
| 1:31:26| and everyone started shouting for him to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| That's where it kind of got disrupted is when everyone was shouting for me to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5489)|
| 1:31:38| Everyone was shouting for you to sit down, but you were very much in control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| and the only thing you did was stood up there and took the abuse of the yelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5503)|
| 1:31:49| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Was there any time where you were afraid that I might become violent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| No, I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| Was there any time that you felt like that any of the people in the crowd would become violent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5518)|
| 1:32:04| No, a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| I felt a lot of anger from a few of the people there that wanted you removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| I think I felt more anger from them than whatever came from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| But they were just expressing themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| They were expressing themselves of wanting you to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| Yeah, nobody was—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| But nobody was—there was no violence or—yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| It was very much exaggerated, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| Okay, well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| You're very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| Okay, I just want to say that, again, I am not going to stand here before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| and tell you I was absolutely perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| You all serve with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| You know how I can get when I'm debating sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| But does this rise to the level that it warrants the type of action that's been taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5567)|
| 1:32:53| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| This is going to be an issue that's going to be around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| Both Mr. Norman and myself have different views, and we have different districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5580)|
| 1:33:05| His district is pretty much built out, and my district, there's a lot of undeveloped land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5585)|
| 1:33:11| So I'm representing my constituents, and I will do so passionately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5591)|
| 1:33:17| I'm sure Mr. Norman will do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| And this is just a political argument between two commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5600)|
| 1:33:26| One other thing that I want to address, and that is particularly the print press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| I think that the electronic press has been very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| But there was a time that my life was threatened, and I had to pull a firearm to defend myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5617)|
| 1:33:46| I sat through a trial for the murder of a gentleman that took place by the same murderer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5626)|
| 1:33:55| a few hours before he got to my place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| I saw the man's body on a gurney presented as evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| That was almost me on that gurney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| That was almost my family weeping over my body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| And remembering that has been a little stressful for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| Thinking about that has been a little stressful for me about the day I almost died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| But let me tell you something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| It has not been nearly as stressful as the stress that our newspaper creates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5663)|
| 1:34:29| our anti-gun newspaper with its anti-gun editor creates over politicizing when and where I carry a firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5669)|
| 1:34:38| I'm an American, a citizen, protected by the Second Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| I have authorizations to carry firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| I have authorizations from the state to carry a firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| From this day forward, I will not answer the question of when and where I carry a firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| Just let it be said that it is legal and legitimate for me to carry a firearm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| And I'm tired of the when and where being politicized by folks that don't believe in our Second Amendment rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5700)|
| 1:35:09| And it's just sad that what is a debate between two very passionate commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| each honorably representing their constituency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| has been turned into a three-ring circus about when and where I carry a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| So in the future, I will no longer answer those questions to the press.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| If law enforcement wants to know when and where, they're welcome to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| They have the authority to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5734)|
| 1:35:35| But I will not answer the press anymore when they ask that question because I think it's unfair to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5735)|
| 1:35:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| We have Ms. Sharon Mayo here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| Ms. Mayo, I need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| Sharon Mayo, 3112 Ghost Cove Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5753)|
| 1:35:55| Could you please pull the microphone toward you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| Sharon Mayo, 3112 Ghost Cove Lane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| I wrote this out because I knew there would be a time, so if you can bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5764)|
| 1:36:12| I came here today to address the disruption of the MPC Task Force public meeting on July the 16th by Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5772)|
| 1:36:22| Mr. Lambert, my community came to this public meeting to discuss issues we are having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5782)|
| 1:36:29| with a ridgetop development owner by Smithfield Development Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| We were greatly appreciative to have the opportunity to address our concerns in such a constructive meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| in the hope that there would be possibly changes made in the future from our recommendations to the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5800)|
| 1:36:48| Our subdivision is directly behind the ridge to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| We came last fall before the MPC after this development had been approved by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5813)|
| 1:37:00| We had concerns which we addressed and to no avail were denied our request to not allow the ridge to be completely cut away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5820)|
| 1:37:09| of all trees and extreme leveling due to concerns of possible mudslides due to erosion and removal of trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5829)|
| 1:37:17| affecting homes in our subdivision in the Grassy Creek Watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| The denial of our request is a result of years of allowing owners of ridgetop and hills to develop without strict laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| and regulations implemented to prevent such damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| In order to assure responsible development now and in the future, as I have stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| strict rules and regulations must be enforced along with the designated authorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5860)|
| 1:37:45| to follow up with on-site viewing at timely intervals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| The EPA department stated to me they are understaffed and cannot take care of all the problems in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| due to such a heavy load of development in this area that has been allowed in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| As a result of lack of responsibility in the development of these approved projects, our community has suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| The excavation of this ridgetop was started last winter and stopped around the end of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| Left behind is a water catch basin improperly working due to broken lines resulting from erosion causing mud and debris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5898)|
| 1:38:27| which has filled up the basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| When we started to get heavy rains this year, a neighbor's backyard directly behind the ridge was flooded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| due to the system not working properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| We watched from our front porch the overflow of mud, water and debris like a dam breaking, rushing into their yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5919)|
| 1:38:48| taking two sections of privacy fence out, moving a 500-pound wooden bridge several feet over the branch outlet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5928)|
| 1:38:57| which flows into the Grassy Creek watershed, and leaving a yard of mud and debris everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| Mr. Lambert, you have stated in recent interviews you are trying to protect the rights of ridge and hilltop owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5943)|
| 1:39:10| to develop their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| But where is the protection for homeowners resulting from damage and loss of property value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| and possible loss of life due to mudslides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| We have no recourse except to plead and appeal to government planning departments to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| When only in return, they are only interested in the revenue from tax dollars of more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| Most homeowners cannot afford to retain attorneys to sue or protect us from damage of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| They only refer us back to the government authorities who approved these developments to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| The owners of Smith Built Development Company, due to lack of government enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| and viewing on-site projects, has not even looked at the non-functioning water catch basin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| or excavation of the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| When called by the neighbor who had the damage, they told her it was the excavation company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| that she would have to contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| They accepted no responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| To our knowledge, they own the excavation company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6013)|
| 1:40:17| Of course, why should they be concerned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| The MPC and other approval departments of Knoxville gave them permission to cut every last tree down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| on the ridge and whatever it takes to complete their development without regard to erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| and possible damage, as I have stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| Mr. Lambert, when you so rudely tried to end our meeting by saying you were taking over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| the pre-planned meeting at Carnes, these were our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| Ms. Mayo, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| The disruption by you created total chaos, which in turn almost ended a much-needed meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| One of the homeowners in our community had to leave after your disruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| and did not get a chance to address the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| He had his two young children with him and did not want them to experience such a mockery of a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6065)|
| 1:41:13| We still have in this country freedom of speech to come to such meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6073)|
| 1:41:17| and be allowed to respectfully address our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| You have no right to take these rights away from citizens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| You may not agree with our ideas and views, but you came to the meeting, we believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| to prevent us from expressing our rights of free speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| You had the right there, as any one of us, to give your views when it was your turn to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| You were not there as our elected commissioner of the 6th District to represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6099)|
| 1:41:45| We can speak for ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| And I'm hoping I have time to thank the people on the task force, you, Mr. Norman, as one of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6108)|
| 1:41:56| who formed and participated in these well-planned, informative meetings throughout the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| The task force has given us an opportunity to respectfully express our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| and also give ideas and recommendations in such meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| We ask that the negative that was experienced at these meetings will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| and should not present you in the future, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| from giving citizens of Knoxville a chance to be heard on future issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6140)|
| 1:42:27| There are many issues that we would like to have the opportunity to discuss in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| Many citizens cannot attend meetings through the day hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| and having the evening meetings gives more of us an opportunity to participate in local government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| in a positive manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Thank you, Mr. Norman, and thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Ms. Mayo, have you met with Knox County Stormwater as your community met with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6170)|
| 1:43:00| I met with them in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| I called one to come out when they first started on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| And they were starting to do the excavating, and there were some problems with the water basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6189)|
| 1:43:15| They put some screens, and it really wasn't truly developed at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| But I have been trying to call for three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| and they are so busy that they can't send anyone out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| What I'm going to ask Mr. Gronju to do, Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| if we could have a meeting at Amherst Elementary School in regard to this issue out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| and if you'll get with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Will you raise your hand so she'll know he's back in the back row back there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| Could you give him your name and phone number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| and we'll try to set up a meeting at Amherst Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| and we'll see if we can start working on it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6229)|
| 1:43:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| Does any commissioner have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| Not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| I would think it's appropriate for us to consider a motion of censure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| so I'll make a motion to censure Commissioner Lambert for his behavior and statements at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| We have a motion on the floor to censure Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| I'll probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6259)|
| 1:44:21| My question is, what does censure mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| We've censured two people in this government business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| Have we done anything to them, or what does censure mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| It's a formal reprimand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| It's a pretty serious reprimand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| It's usually used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| I studied the situation on the Internet, and it's usually used in pretty extreme situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6283)|
| 1:44:50| In fact, looking back on it, I'm not sure that when we censured the mayor if that was quite proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6290)|
| 1:44:57| We didn't give him any opportunity for due process or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| I mean, this commission can do what it likes, but it's a pretty extreme thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| and while I may get passionate at times when debating, I don't think it rises anywhere near to the level of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6308)|
| 1:45:18| But it's up to this commission, since the motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| And I truly struggle turning on the light here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6326)|
| 1:45:33| But I think I'd probably have a few hours, a few restless hours tonight if I didn't speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6333)|
| 1:45:43| And it's more than just emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| And the one statement, we're all fairly well versed on Robert's Rules of Order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6348)|
| 1:45:55| You know you can't take over a meeting of co-chair, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| So saying that and attempting that was more than emotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| It was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| We all represent our people and our constituents, but more importantly, I think we all represent Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6368)|
| 1:46:16| You know, a lot of people out here, yea first, yea second, whatever, seventh, eighth, but we're all Knox County commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6376)|
| 1:46:24| When I made the decision to run for this office, it truly was in turmoil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| And that's why I ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| That's the sole reason I ran, is to bring some type of decorum, respectability back to Knox County commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6392)|
| 1:46:40| But it's been one thing after another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| We should speak out when wrong is done, and that was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| That one piece was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| For you to go and try to co-opt a meeting is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| Brad Mays comes here monthly and has strong opinions, but he doesn't take over the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6416)|
| 1:47:07| He waits on his time and he speaks his passion and he speaks his point and then he's moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6427)|
| 1:47:16| You know, he moves on to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| He works in between time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| What happened at South Dolan Karnes, you know, and I think former commissioner DeFries probably spoke totally correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6441)|
| 1:47:30| you know, a rant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| A rant is lack of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| And I think that's what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| But the one statement and the one thing that I guess kind of sticks with me, because we are a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| We are a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| We're a singular body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| It's mockery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| Ms. Mayo said a mockery, and that's really what bothers me is that the way this is being played out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6474)|
| 1:48:03| and they're just reporting the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| Some may report one aspect more than the other, but this is a mockery, and we need to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6486)|
| 1:48:17| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| You know, we've gone through a situation with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| We're in the middle of a situation with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| Now we have commissioners acting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| So I think a censure is very serious, but I think it's getting off light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6507)|
| 1:48:36| I think what you tried to do, especially at Karnes, was wrong, and I've asked people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6516)|
| 1:48:42| I've asked some people who I trust what the situation was, and it does not speak well of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6522)|
| 1:48:53| You're a representative of this body, and I think this body, when you have someone acting out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6533)|
| 1:48:59| acting inappropriately, acting beyond the bounds of proper decorum in meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6539)|
| 1:49:09| I think we need to speak out and speak against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| Commissioner, I think Commissioner Hammer was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| I want to make sure I understand what I'm voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| Would you define for me the censure action and exactly what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6566)|
| 1:49:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| The most recognized definition of censure is an official reprimand by a legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| of one of its members by way of strong or vehement expression of disapproval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6577)|
| 1:49:42| It's essentially a two-part process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| One, a motion to censure is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| If that is approved, then the second part would be to actually censure the member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6585)|
| 1:49:49| by basically advising the member of the behavior that is considered that which is either repugnant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6589)|
| 1:49:57| or brings disapproval or undue criticism or unnecessary criticism upon the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6597)|
| 1:50:03| Who would deliver the censure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| That would be the chairman to designate someone to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| So once the motion is made, let's say a motion is made and passed theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| the chairman would then designate a member of the body to issue the censure if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| or she does not wish to do so, him or herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6627)|
| 1:50:28| In the last censure, we heard the verbiage after we voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6628)|
| 1:50:33| I think the question was partially answered right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| We're not going to hear the verbiage before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| Am I going to hear the sentence before I vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| Well, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6646)|
| 1:50:47| What would occur, the appropriate procedure would be a member of the commission would make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| to censure the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| If that motion passes, that is then followed by the actual censure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| So it's a two-part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| Merely having a motion to censure is merely getting the censure to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| and then the person is censured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| In other words, his or her behavior is outlined as to why the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| or the body is disapproving of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| Point of clarification, can that happen, does that have to happen immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| or can it happen subsequent meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6677)|
| 1:51:22| Robert's Rules, general Robert's Rules behavior is it's contemporaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6682)|
| 1:51:28| You do the motion and then it's followed immediately by the censure because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| the whole idea is to immediately bring it to light and act upon it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| so it doesn't have a staleness aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| As the maker of the motion, can I make the suggested wording before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| so as Commissioner Wright knows what wording he's voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| That's certainly appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| The chair will recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| I will make the suggested wording of the censure motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| Have you finished, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| I'm getting what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| Then I think something like the Knox County Commission censures Commissioner Greg Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| for disruptive behavior at a meeting of the task force on ridge, slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| and hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| Straightforward and simple sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| As I said at the Intergovernmental Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| it is a distinct honor to be elected to county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| I ask by your citizens to represent them in this county and in the governance of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6749)|
| 1:52:36| But along with that comes a huge responsibility to help this county prosper and grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6756)|
| 1:52:41| and to do things that reflect well on the county, not poorly on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| As Commissioner McKenzie noted, there has been one thing after another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6766)|
| 1:52:53| since we were elected to this commission that do not reflect well on the governance of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6773)|
| 1:53:01| In fact, when I look around, the governance I see is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| And I'm very pleased with a lot of things we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| When actions like Mr. Lambert's or other actions that we've seen in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6792)|
| 1:53:19| and in our governmental body in the whole of Knox County begin to occur, we don't look so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6799)|
| 1:53:28| We have a cloud over us, and that makes it more difficult for us to attract good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| new business to this community and to make sure that our education system works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6813)|
| 1:53:38| I concur in this action, and I think our actions do matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| And I think we need to act in a very responsible manner to help this community grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| Mr. Jarrett, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| Under Robert's Rules of Order, does the chairman of the commission have the ability to remove a member from a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6836)|
| 1:54:05| in which actions taken that he feels disruptive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| Or is that the commission rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| I believe your commission rules if you have a member during the course of a meeting that disrupts the governmental process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| has the ability to either call a recess or ask that member to step down temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| I'll confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| But Robert's Rules likewise alludes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| Can I answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Our own rules that the chairman can remove a member of commission if they so deem that they need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6869)|
| 1:54:37| if they're disrupting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| They can also keep them out until they decide to let them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| That's what our rules state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| I don't know precisely what Robert's Rules, but our own rules allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| Section H reads, if any person refuses to remain orderly, the chairman shall call that person to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6890)|
| 1:54:55| If that person refuses to come to order, the chairman has a right to order the person removed from the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6895)|
| 1:55:01| This person may return only after approval of the chairman or a majority vote of the commission present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| That's broad enough to include one of your members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| I just, you know, I'm kind of in a tight spot here because although I don't agree with actions that disrupt a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6909)|
| 1:55:18| and if Mr. Lambert, I was not available for the Carnes meeting, but I was at the Powell meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6918)|
| 1:55:24| If I vote for this censure, I'd help myself politically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| and I don't believe that it's proper for me to vote to help myself politically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6927)|
| 1:55:34| Although I wish that the chairman to discipline, and I think it, you know, I don't agree with everything he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6934)|
| 1:55:42| I don't agree with his actions at times, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6942)|
| 1:55:46| There's actions on this commission that I don't agree with in every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| We violate Robert's rules of order in every single meeting we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| Somebody argues with another member of the commission every time that I've been in a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| And as much as I disagree with what went on in Carnes, from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| I think it was blown out of proportion somewhat, but I still disagree with the actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6964)|
| 1:56:10| I think censure is permanent as far as being a legislator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| and I just wish that the chairman would take the stance for the, you know, telling Mr. Lambert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6976)|
| 1:56:25| if you do it again, you're removed from a meeting and you're not coming back until you learn how to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| You know, that's what I wished would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| But that's how I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| I checked with our law director before I did what I did last week, and I have talked to Mr. Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=6996)|
| 1:56:43| and I've also talked to Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| I've also interviewed at least five or six people that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| And so I've expressed to all of them my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7010)|
| 1:56:57| Mr. Chairman, could you let us know what you were able to find out from talking to the people that were there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7017)|
| 1:57:06| And I know there's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| I'll turn my light on and wait my turn and ask some questions and make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7028)|
| 1:57:15| Well, it's basically what we've already heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| I talked to Ms. Mayo, and she said it did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| Several said it did, and some said it was blown out of proportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| So I had both on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7046)|
| 1:57:31| Some said it was blown out of proportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| Some said it happened exactly the way it was stated by Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7052)|
| 1:57:39| And I have, as I said, I have talked to both of them at least twice, maybe Commissioner Lambert three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7059)|
| 1:57:47| But I do, yeah, three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| So that's basically been split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| How many commissioners here were at this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7082)|
| 1:58:12| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| We're sitting here today as a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| When you stop and think about it now, and you've seen it here before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| Commissioner Norman and Commissioner Lambert have a personality conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| I've seen Mr. Norman just as loud and abrasive as Commissioner Lambert back and forth with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7108)|
| 1:58:36| I wasn't there, and as we all know, we can't go but what the press says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7116)|
| 1:58:44| They try you without a jury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| Now, when you get right down to it, I can't vote for this censure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| and the reason why I can't vote for this censure is we've had witnesses here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7133)|
| 1:59:00| Two of them were on Mr. Lambert's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7140)|
| 1:59:03| One was on Mr. Norman's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| We need to disregard what Commissioner Lambert and Commissioner Norman say because we know they have a personality conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7146)|
| 1:59:15| But I was at a meeting where, before all this came out in the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7155)|
| 1:59:24| one of my constituents was talked to by a reporter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| and they said this was going to really be blowed out of proportion that they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| So all I'm saying is I cannot vote for a censure based on the evidence we've had here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7175)|
| 1:59:41| Now, with a jury, we'd have to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| Who do we believe, this lady here or the three witnesses that Mr. Lambert had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7184)|
| 1:59:51| You would have to say go with Mr. Lambert because he had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| Now, that don't mean they're truthful, but it also does not mean the other woman's truthful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| or it don't mean any of them are untruthful or truthful either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| But I think this was blowed out of proportion, and I cannot vote for a censure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7206)|
| 2:00:14| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| I'd like to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| I think there's a gentleman there that would like to make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| I happen to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| I need your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7223)|
| 2:00:25| I live at 5316 West Beaver Creek Road, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| I was at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| Mr. Norman knows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| Mr. Lambert knows it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| I sat right behind him, and, yes, Mr. Lambert was out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7235)|
| 2:00:40| I was nervous because I know Mr. Lambert carries a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| There was many people there that was calling for the sheriff to be called to ask Mr. Lambert to be escorted out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7246)|
| 2:00:54| Yes, it was very heated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| There was people standing up, and, yes, I think if somebody would have touched Mr. Lambert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7257)|
| 2:01:03| or would have touched Lonnie Harris that was sitting right beside him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| or would have touched me, you know, if Mr. Lambert would have turned around to me, because I was telling him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| you need to sit down and be quiet and let everybody else speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7273)|
| 2:01:17| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Mr. Lambert was totally, 100 percent in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7279)|
| 2:01:24| He was out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| I mean totally out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| He stood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| He walked up, moved Mr. Norman out of the way, and said, I'm taking this meeting over right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7289)|
| 2:01:37| I'm taking this meeting over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7297)|
| 2:01:39| These are my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7299)|
| 2:01:41| These are the people that voted me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| That was his words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| That was his exact words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| The people that were sitting there was asking him very nicely, please, sit down and be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| Wait your turn, like everybody else in the meeting did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7317)|
| 2:02:02| Finally, Mr. Norman got everybody calmed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| He did a very good job of that, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| But he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7329)|
| 2:02:10| He got everybody calmed down, and we got to carry on with this meeting on the ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7330)|
| 2:02:18| I think Mr. Lambert is totally out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7338)|
| 2:02:21| I have been personally, Mr. Lambert has been to my home and personally has not been too happy to be at my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7341)|
| 2:02:33| He has passed on some information to me in my situation with the landscaping that I'm in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7353)|
| 2:02:40| I took that as a threat from Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| There was many people that heard this right out here in the hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7363)|
| 2:02:47| And I don't think that that was very good of Mr. Lambert at that time to come and tell me that, hey, your neighbor, he's going to get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7367)|
| 2:02:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| If he don't win today, he's going to get you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| That was the exact words from Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| And I have people that witnessed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| So I took that as a threat coming from a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| And I don't think that that was very commissioner-like, that we elected a man that would come and relay a threat from somebody else to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7388)|
| 2:03:19| And so I was nervous at the night of the meeting because everybody knows that Mr. Lambert carries a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| Everybody knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| And it's just like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7407)|
| 2:03:28| Somebody at an earlier date had pointed a gun at Mr. Lambert at one time and tried to take his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7408)|
| 2:03:37| If that man's got a gun on him and he gets scared, he's going to pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7417)|
| 2:03:42| That scares me if I'm in a meeting and he gets scared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| That scares me bad if I know he's got a gun on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| I don't think he ought to be able to carry a gun in any of the commissioner meetings or any other meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| Myself, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| He's not allowed to carry one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| If you wasn't there, you don't know how Mr. Lambert acted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7440)|
| 2:04:04| I was there, and Mr. Lambert acted very unprofessional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7444)|
| 2:04:09| Sir, pardon me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7449)|
| 2:04:10| I have a question to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| You were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| And I believe I heard you say that the people asked him to sit down very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| Yes, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| That's the point I'm getting to about the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7461)|
| 2:04:24| I believe it was reported in the newspaper that these people were shouting for him to sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7464)|
| 2:04:29| Actually, it got to that because Mr. Lambert would not sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| It did turn into a shouting effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| But at first they were saying, please, no, sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| Even Tony over here was telling him, Greg, wait your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| Wait your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| He would not wait his turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| There was another lady talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| Who did you say over there was asking him what he should do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| Oh, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| I didn't catch who you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7494)|
| 2:04:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| He was telling him, you know, he was doing this, you know, wait your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Wait your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| He was trying to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7500)|
| 2:05:01| Finally, he got it calmed down because everybody was leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| They said, this meeting is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7504)|
| 2:05:06| We're leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| And they didn't want that to happen because these people had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| The Karnes community had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| But it was turning into a shouting match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| And then Mr. Norman finally got everybody to calm down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| and everybody started waiting their turn, and the meeting went on as proceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7523)|
| 2:05:29| And that's the way the meeting happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7532)|
| 2:05:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7533)|
| 2:05:34| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Yes, and I think this is one of the very difficult things that we have to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7536)|
| 2:05:42| because we're talking about not only a fellow commissioner here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| and I'm talking about Commissioner Lambert, but he's also a friend of many of ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7545)|
| 2:05:53| Nevertheless, it's almost like in baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7553)|
| 2:05:59| We had strike one where Mr. Lambert got into an altercation with a member of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7559)|
| 2:06:07| who came to express his rights as a citizen to protect his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7567)|
| 2:06:11| or to have concerns about his neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7571)|
| 2:06:14| We had strike two when there was an alleged disruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| And from what I've heard, there was a disruption, not once,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| but then a few days later a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| As commissioners, we're not held to the same standard that the rest of the public is held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7589)|
| 2:06:36| We're supposed to be examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| We're supposed to represent the best of democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| We're the people who, when there is a problem in the community that goes out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| to settle the problem down, if there is a potential civic disturbance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| we're the ones that are supposed to show how a meeting is to be conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| And the fact that that's happened now three times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| in just a little over that number of months concerns me very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| I will say in defense of Commissioner Lambert's right to have a permit to carry a gun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7621)|
| 2:07:09| I don't know, but I really don't think that that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7629)|
| 2:07:14| He has had multiple opportunities, if he wanted to, to pull a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7634)|
| 2:07:19| It would be justified to even use that weapon, and he did not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| He showed self-restraint there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7643)|
| 2:07:25| And so I really would like to divorce the issue of him having a permit to carry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7645)|
| 2:07:30| and what his actions might be, because I think he's shown us in very stressful situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7650)|
| 2:07:36| that he can show restraint in that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| Nevertheless, I think there is a line that's drawn when a commissioner is disrupting a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7660)|
| 2:07:48| that reflects poorly on all of us, because whether we like it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| each one of us who goes out and faces the public, we're the face of the entire commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| And when we do good, we all get credit whether we deserve it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| And when we act improperly, we get the blame whether we deserve it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| And for that reason, since this is really the third time that that's happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| I think at this point we have to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| We gave him a pass a few months ago as something that occurred in a moment of passion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7697)|
| 2:08:23| but I think at some point we have to say no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7713)|
| 2:08:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7714)|
| 2:08:35| This, again, is difficult because I think that there are a few of us on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| that are lightning rods for public comment, myself being one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7718)|
| 2:08:44| As we have gone through the last couple of years, we've seen quite a bit of comments made about different people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| We've had situations here on commission where we have said things to one another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| that perhaps we shouldn't have said, but that's just the way it is in a political body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| and that's the way it is when you're passionate about an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| I would like to make a substitute motion, and the substitute motion is basically this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7743)|
| 2:09:08| and Mr. Jarrett, help me with my wording here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7748)|
| 2:09:13| The commission recognizes Mr. Lambert's actions at the Carnes meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| as not being in keeping with the proper decorum of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| The commission instructs Mr. Lambert to maintain proper decorum befitting his office at further meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| A failure to do so could result in censure action by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| I think this is, in my mind, we're saying to Mr. Lambert, you know, Mr. Lambert, you yourself have said you went over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7769)|
| 2:09:39| We recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| We're asking you to cool it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| We're saying, lumpy, don't do it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7783)|
| 2:09:45| But if you do, then there's going to be consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7785)|
| 2:09:48| I'd like to throw that out as a substitute motion and just see what the body has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7788)|
| 2:09:54| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| I'll probably move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7799)|
| 2:10:01| I think, Commissioner Wright, you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7801)|
| 2:10:09| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| This sort of throws me off just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7810)|
| 2:10:16| Could we vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Could everyone turn their light out and let's vote on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7817)|
| 2:10:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| It would be voting on the substitute motion is what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| Excuse me, the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| You could call for the question, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7829)|
| 2:10:32| These lights are out on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| Do you all want to turn them out on this side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| Get you doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| We've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7844)|
| 2:10:45| We've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| Bought the T-shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| We have been dealing with it, like Commissioner Briggs said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7851)|
| 2:10:56| It predates us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7856)|
| 2:10:57| I mean, just sitting back thinking, you know, and he may have had a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7857)|
| 2:11:02| but when he pretty much accosted Cynthia Finch, right, wrong, or indifferent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7862)|
| 2:11:10| Right there at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| Wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| Oh, Lumpy, don't do that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7874)|
| 2:11:17| You know, catch him on film attacking a member of the public for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7877)|
| 2:11:24| or going after him verbally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7884)|
| 2:11:26| Oh, please don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7886)|
| 2:11:27| And that's what we would do if we passed this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7887)|
| 2:11:32| That's exactly what we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| Okay, next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| You know, it's like when you count to five with your three-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| If you get to five, if that's the method you choose, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7902)|
| 2:11:46| at some point you've got to get to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| And I think we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7909)|
| 2:11:50| I think we have turned a blind eye, been very patient, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7910)|
| 2:12:00| it's not personal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| It really isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| I like Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7926)|
| 2:12:08| But these actions require consequences and subsequent actions on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7928)|
| 2:12:16| So I'm very passionate about this because I struggle with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| I struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7939)|
| 2:12:20| This is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| He's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| This is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7942)|
| 2:12:24| But trying to take over a public meeting is serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| By everyone's account, losing your mind in public is a very serious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7950)|
| 2:12:39| And so, you know, when we talk about a jury, when we talk about going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| I like to ask each one of them, did it happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7963)|
| 2:12:47| and I forget the last gentleman's name that came to the podium, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7967)|
| 2:12:54| and I think, you know, did you try to take over the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7980)|
| 2:13:03| Did you inappropriately try to take over the meeting, Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7983)|
| 2:13:07| I think your own testimony, I think you actually said that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7987)|
| 2:13:11| But we want to do another hand slap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7991)|
| 2:13:14| I'm ready for something serious to happen as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=7994)|
| 2:13:21| And maybe it will tell us all when we're out there in the 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| or the 9th or whatever district and things start to escalate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| and we get to that fork in the road that we go in the right direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| that we say, okay, you know, I am a member of a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8011)|
| 2:13:36| There is a greater accountability than just my personal rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| or even my own constituency that I lean with rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8020)|
| 2:13:46| There's a greater Knox County point and purpose to this all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8026)|
| 2:13:50| and there's a process that we can go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8030)|
| 2:13:53| Again, every month we tell people, go through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8033)|
| 2:13:57| Sit and listen to the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| Sit and listen to the education calendar consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| Sit and listen to all the resolutions and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| Then we'll give you time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| But what are we saying when we say, because we've been elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| there's this buddy-buddy, I'm going to let you come in and take over a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8053)|
| 2:14:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| So I just implore you all to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8058)|
| 2:14:21| It's not personal, but let's do something and say something strong and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8061)|
| 2:14:32| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8072)|
| 2:14:34| Is everyone clear what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8074)|
| 2:14:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8077)|

| 2:14:42| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| This is on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8085)|

| 2:16:08| No, he said present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Let me take a two-third vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8169)|
| 2:16:10| Is it a simple majority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8170)|

| 2:16:50| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| I also want to say that I do not think this is a question about guns or violence or threats or accusations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| And at that point, I would like to hear the sentence again for censure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| May I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| May I, for the benefit of Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| The Knox County Commission censures Commissioner Greg Lambert for disruptive behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8233)|
| 2:17:19| on Ridge Slope and Hillside Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| Disruptive behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8241)|
| 2:17:24| I would submit to my fellow commissioners that that probably happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8244)|
| 2:17:28| I would think that if everyone could turn their lights off that we could vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8248)|
| 2:17:33| and that I would think Commissioner Lambert may have a badge that he can put on his shirt when we go home tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8253)|
| 2:17:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| I just want to reiterate what Mr. Pinkston said just a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| You know, I was not in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| And, you know, if it's in our district, we usually try to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8267)|
| 2:17:50| And it's hard for me to vote on something that I did not witness, two people saying different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8270)|
| 2:17:57| And it puts us in, I'm sort of like Brad, it puts me in a hard situation as to what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| and how to vote because I didn't witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8282)|
| 2:18:05| We, I mean, I sit beside him here for three years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| You can tell some of his body languages and his moods and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| So, where it may be threatening some people and others that may know that he's just a puppy dog, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| But it's just hard for me to vote on something that I personally did not witness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8301)|
| 2:18:30| You're like Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| I likewise am like Commissioner Smith and Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| I was not at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| And I like both these gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8318)|
| 2:18:40| Tony is my cohort in my third district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| I hate the situation where we can't get along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| And everybody, I think, knows that Mr. Lambert does have an opportunity sometime to open his mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| when he wishes he could keep it shut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| But I'm not going to go along with the censor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| If it's possible, maybe we'll censor both of them because both of them had witnesses there that both of them got a little loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8335)|
| 2:19:01| But at this point, I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8341)|
| 2:19:07| Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| I was hoping it wouldn't come down to this, but it's hard for me also to vote on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| Commissioner Smith and I were at our district meeting that same week that all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| And, boy, ours was nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| So, we must be very boring people out in the seventh district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8363)|
| 2:19:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8366)|
| 2:19:27| But, anyway, I like everyone that's involved, and I highly respect everyone, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| And I wasn't there, and it does sound like both sides really were very passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8372)|
| 2:19:37| and got very debatable on it and who's to say who's who, what, what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8377)|
| 2:19:44| I wasn't there, and I hear both sides were a little bit unruly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| So, who am I to censor someone or discipline someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8388)|
| 2:19:55| I discipline my children when they've done something right in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8395)|
| 2:20:00| And you also have to give and take with your children, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8400)|
| 2:20:04| So, anyway, you choose your battles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| But I wasn't there, and I feel it very hard to take one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8407)|
| 2:20:16| Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8416)|
| 2:20:19| I just want to say again, this is politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8419)|
| 2:20:22| It's political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8422)|
| 2:20:23| I have acknowledged that I was less than perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8423)|
| 2:20:29| I'm often less than perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8429)|
| 2:20:30| I'm a human being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| But does it rise to the level of censure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8433)|
| 2:20:36| And censure is a very serious thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| It's far more serious than we take it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| I guess it comes down to which side of the issue you're on, which side you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8446)|
| 2:20:53| I was less than perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| I believe that Mr. Norman was less than perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| But it does not rise to the level of censure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8459)|
| 2:21:06| But, I mean, I guess let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8466)|
| 2:21:11| Motion on the floor is to censor Commissioner Labbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| Mr. Chairman, there's a lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8474)|
| 2:21:16| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| The people who are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8480)|
| 2:21:22| Could you state your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8482)|
| 2:21:23| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| Sharon Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| The people on this commission who are saying you were not there, what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8486)|
| 2:21:33| it's not about passion or people getting upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8493)|
| 2:21:38| What this is about is when we have a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| and the task force that formed this meeting, you're not understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| This meeting was formed for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8508)|
| 2:21:54| This meeting was not formed for a commissioner to come to the meeting and say I'm taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8514)|
| 2:22:03| Now, some way I don't know what the problem is that you're not understanding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8523)|
| 2:22:09| The protocol of any meeting, the meetings that I have been to in other states in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8529)|
| 2:22:15| I had never experienced, like I said, such a mockery of an elected official at a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8535)|
| 2:22:22| If people get upset, they might express how they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8542)|
| 2:22:27| or they might say things in a tone that is above their normal tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8547)|
| 2:22:35| But this was not about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8555)|
| 2:22:37| This was about a meeting that Mr. Norman and the other gentleman, Hulk Christ, that was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8557)|
| 2:22:46| they were going to have to end this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8566)|
| 2:22:50| That we came in anticipation of being able to express ideas and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| This has nothing to do with Mr. Lambert, you know, losing his temper, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8576)|
| 2:23:03| and this has to do with him saying the meeting I'm taking over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| This was a planned meeting, a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| I don't think you understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| If you go in and interrupt any meeting in public government and say I'm taking over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8595)|
| 2:23:23| any of you that would be speaking, Michelle Carringer saying she's not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| Mr. Pinkston saying you're not there, I'm not taking sides here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| I'm just stating a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8612)|
| 2:23:34| This is not the way the public should behave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| You're representing us. It's shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| This was in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8622)|
| 2:23:44| This was ridiculous that we are represented by people on our commission who is taking over the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8624)|
| 2:23:54| We are the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| We're the ones you are serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8636)|
| 2:23:59| So treat us with respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8639)|
| 2:24:02| You seem to be concerned over censure for Mr. Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8642)|
| 2:24:07| We have no recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8647)|
| 2:24:10| No one is helping us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| That's the reason this task force was formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8652)|
| 2:24:15| And I thank these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| You know, it was not easy that Mr. Norman, Mr. Hulchrist, stood there and took the abuse that they took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8657)|
| 2:24:23| And I don't know Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| I don't know Mr. Hulchrist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| He did not even know I was going to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8668)|
| 2:24:32| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8672)|
| 2:24:34| I don't even think he knows me except for when I was at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| He did not know me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| So I'm just saying I'm embarrassed, and I want to thank Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8680)|
| 2:24:45| Really, you are expressing what we should be as Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8685)|
| 2:24:51| what he expressed as a community, as an example to public behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8691)|
| 2:24:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8699)|
| 2:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8707)|
| 2:25:09| I just want to say one last thing because I'm ready to vote, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8709)|
| 2:25:11| And just, you know, Tony, I like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| You know, you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| But, commissioners, if you will remember, when this committee was formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8716)|
| 2:25:19| Mr. Lambert asked to be on this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| and he was turned down that he could not be on this committee for Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| And I'm thinking, you know, there's some frustration right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| When he attends these meetings and stuff, he's got things that he's passionate about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| and he wants to speak about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8731)|
| 2:25:33| If maybe he had been on this committee and could have shared his thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| maybe some of those things could have been passed on, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8736)|
| 2:25:38| But I just wanted to remind us of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8738)|
| 2:25:42| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| I did ask to be on this committee, and I think that I never raised my voice at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8747)|
| 2:25:54| I did mistakenly use the words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8754)|
| 2:25:57| I guess I need to take over or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8757)|
| 2:26:02| I shouldn't have stood up and iterated that I wanted to co-chair the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| I asked for some professional courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| I said I'd like to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| I had been knee-deep in retention ponds that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| and something was mentioned about retention ponds and the previous night's storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8778)|
| 2:26:25| He throws his hands in my face and says, wait your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| Mr. Norman would not treat anybody else on this commission the way he did in that instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8790)|
| 2:26:38| He would not throw such a fit about someone asking to be on a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8798)|
| 2:26:45| for something that they're passionate about were it anybody but me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8805)|
| 2:26:51| There's a double standard when it comes to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| I understand I'm a little different than everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| My legislative style is a little different than everybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8816)|
| 2:27:00| and I'll admit sometimes I'm less than perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8820)|
| 2:27:07| This started from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8827)|
| 2:27:09| I've always been outspoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8829)|
| 2:27:12| But at this meeting, the one at Carnes, and I think that's what most of this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| I didn't raise my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| I pleaded with Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| I said, come on, work with me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| But he made it clear that he wanted me to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| and not speak until I was called on as if I was one of his students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8847)|
| 2:27:32| Finally, when I saw that the meeting was going to end, I sat down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| and I participated in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8857)|
| 2:27:40| Now, sure, you can find folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8860)|
| 2:27:42| Me and this gentleman have had quite a debate for quite some time over another issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8862)|
| 2:27:48| and I'm sure that this lady is on one side of this issue, this slope protection issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| and I'm on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| We are involved in politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| I am sure that you can find folks that don't politically agree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8879)|
| 2:28:06| that want to see me censured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| But at some point, each and every one of you sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| other folks are going to disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8897)|
| 2:28:20| Each and every one of you that's sitting here with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| citizens could be found to say things against you in an attempt to attack you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8903)|
| 2:28:31| We're involved in politics, and that's what's been going on here today is politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8911)|
| 2:28:40| I had my evidence, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| I didn't drag my folks down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| I actually said, I think it will suffice for you to let me take your statement on video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8924)|
| 2:28:50| Most of the folks that I had were working people that needed to be at their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8930)|
| 2:28:57| But I presented evidence that shows one side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| and they presented evidence that shows another side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8941)|
| 2:29:05| And again, I have never said that I was perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8945)|
| 2:29:09| I have never said that I was an angel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8949)|
| 2:29:12| What I have said is that this did not rise to the level of a censurable offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8952)|
| 2:29:19| But politics being as they are, I'm sure that this commission will do what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8959)|
| 2:29:26| I know just a couple of days after a young man tried to kill me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8966)|
| 2:29:30| this commission decided to make fun of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8970)|
| 2:29:34| So I'm sure this commission is going to do whatever it's going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8974)|
| 2:29:38| and I just think someday it will be you sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8978)|
| 2:29:41| and we're all politicians, and we all have political enemies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8981)|
| 2:29:45| and someday maybe they can stack the evidence to have you censured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8985)|
| 2:29:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8996)|
| 2:29:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| I was hoping we were able to get out of this without spending an hour, hour and a half, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9001)|
| 2:30:06| It's unfortunate we have to spend this kind of time on such a subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9006)|
| 2:30:12| but I do feel like it is important, and I think Mr. McKenzie said it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| We have an obligation to represent the folks of this county in a manner that befits the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9017)|
| 2:30:27| And if, whether it's Mr. Lambert, whether it's me, whether it's any one of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9027)|
| 2:30:34| that disregards that, then we're subject to the same rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| But we're going to have to put all this petty stuff behind us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9040)|
| 2:30:43| and move on with doing some business that we need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| We could have had a whole lot of issues in the time that we have spent arguing over this one thing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9046)|
| 2:30:53| So I'll call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| I don't see any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9056)|
| 2:30:58| The motion on the floor is to censor Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9058)|
| 2:31:05| So we need to have a roll call vote starting in the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9065)|
| 2:31:09| Commissioner McKenzie? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| Commissioner Strickland? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9071)|

| 2:31:20| Commissioner Abenharmon? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| Commissioner Saunders? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| Commissioner Schaus? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| Commissioner Hammond? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9092)|
| 2:31:34| Commissioner Lutho? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9094)|
| 2:31:38| Commissioner Briggs? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| Commissioner Anders? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| Commissioner Lambert? I think I'll pass on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| Commissioner Smith? Would you say no? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9114)|
| 2:32:01| I mean, I agree with everything that's been said today, but there's been two sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9121)|
| 2:32:05| There's two sides to everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| I think I'm going to abstain from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9131)|
| 2:32:18| Commissioner Armstrong? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| Commissioner Wright? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| Commissioner Brown? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| Commissioner Pinkston? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9148)|
| 2:32:32| Does the pass wish to vote? I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9152)|
| 2:32:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9157)|
| 2:32:40| Change your vote to yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9160)|
| 2:33:02| The motion passes 12 yes, 5 no, and 1 pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9182)|
| 2:33:09| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9189)|
| 2:33:12| Should I read the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9192)|
| 2:33:13| Mr. Harmon, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9193)|
| 2:33:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9194)|
| 2:33:15| This is the formal reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9195)|
| 2:33:16| Knox County Commission censures Commissioner Greg Lambert for disruptive behavior at a meeting of the task force on ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9196)|
| 2:33:26| slope, and hillside development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9206)|
| 2:33:35| Can we take a break, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9215)|
| 2:33:38| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| Yeah, before we take a break, I'd like to tell everyone again to please speak into your mics when you vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9219)|
| 2:33:50| and when you also have to speak because it's not picking up and the clerks have to type from the messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9230)|
| 2:34:00| We need a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9240)|
| 2:34:05| Five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9245)|
| 2:34:10| We're ready to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9250)|
| 2:34:20| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9260)|
| 2:34:36| Mr. Chairman, if you could, Roy Cruz has a quick public announcement he'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9276)|
| 2:34:40| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| Mr. Cruz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9281)|
| 2:34:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9283)|
| 2:34:45| I'd like to take the opportunity to invite each and every one of you and all the folks here in the room today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9285)|
| 2:34:52| We're having our fourth annual Happy Holler Palooza down in Happy Holler on August the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9292)|
| 2:35:00| and it will be sponsored by the North Knox Professional Business Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9300)|
| 2:35:05| And what's so unique about this street fair is we're going to shut down four blocks, from Baxter to Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9305)|
| 2:35:13| It was a huge success last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9313)|
| 2:35:15| We're going to have three stages this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| We're going to have two outside and one inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| We'll have five hours of free music, and it will go from gospel to blues to pickin' to country to 80s, 90s, and some rock and roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9320)|
| 2:35:32| We're also going to have freezo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9332)|
| 2:35:34| We'll be giving ice cream all day from 4 to 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9334)|
| 2:35:38| The Epilepsy Foundation will be furnishing helmets for all children on bicycles and skateboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9338)|
| 2:35:45| Last year we gave out around 250 helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| It's part of our mission for prevention of brain injury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| The only out-of-pocket cost to anyone will really be for people who want to purchase food from the purveyors of food down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9353)|
| 2:36:01| So I would encourage any and all of you to come down and really take a hard, long look at Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9361)|
| 2:36:08| I think you'll be pleasantly surprised if you haven't been down there recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| They've got a lot of new venues, a lot of new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9372)|
| 2:36:16| And I would just encourage you to come down, support the event, and thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| Hey, Roy, a question for you over here on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9385)|
| 2:36:27| You know, these commissioners have discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| If you need some, I'm sure they'd be glad to give you maybe 250 apiece if you ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9390)|
| 2:36:34| Well, anybody that would be so inclined to want to be generous in your discretionary funds, we would be deeply appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9394)|
| 2:36:43| I can tell you we've had some of the county commissioners step up, and they've been very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9403)|
| 2:36:48| We greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| That's how we're able to sit there and offer this free event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| And I will tell you, it starts at 4 to 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| So I would encourage you to please come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9417)|
| 2:36:59| If you care to give some money to us, please look me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9419)|
| 2:37:02| A lot of people have my phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9424)|
| 2:37:05| Roy always wants your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9425)|
| 2:37:07| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9427)|
| 2:37:12| I'd like to bring up Mike Owens, chief of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9432)|
| 2:37:16| Just a quick one, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9436)|
| 2:37:19| We were asked last month about possibly bringing the organizations we've given money to, to the commission to do reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9439)|
| 2:37:28| And then I had several commissioners ask to maybe work out a different way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9448)|
| 2:37:33| Just keep in mind we have 66 groups that we've given money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| In addition to that, the money that you give through your discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| So if you look today, we approved item 511.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9462)|
| 2:37:45| You approved 511.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| With any organization that we didn't go through our citizen review committee, we're setting up compliance contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9467)|
| 2:37:55| MOUs, where we have deliverables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9475)|
| 2:37:58| The other organizations, what we'd like to do is maybe ones that you would like to hear from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| bring them to a lunch before the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| Commissioner Hammond's bringing Dogwood next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| The following month we're going to have a luncheon with the Helen Ross McNabb folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| We're going to talk about everything they're doing at John Tarlington, including some new programs they're bringing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9492)|
| 2:38:18| And then if you'd like to, maybe have a special lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| and have Barbara Cook go over the whole compliance formulas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9501)|
| 2:38:26| She monitors each one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9506)|
| 2:38:28| So if that's an approach you'd like to take versus bringing the groups in on the commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9508)|
| 2:38:35| but if there's any particular groups you'd like to hear from, just let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9515)|
| 2:38:38| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| No, don't let him run away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9528)|
| 2:38:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9529)|
| 2:38:51| Mr. Arms, are these grant money that's coming out of, I guess, that the mayor has, his discretionary funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9531)|
| 2:39:01| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9541)|
| 2:39:02| No, I'm talking about all the groups who went before citizen panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9542)|
| 2:39:08| We have a compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| So these are the ones that went through the process and received money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9551)|
| 2:39:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9553)|
| 2:39:14| It was approved through the budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9556)|
| 2:39:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9557)|
| 2:39:18| Including all these MOUs were approved through the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9558)|
| 2:39:20| Then, of course, the money, the mayor's discretionary money and your blocks of discretionary money are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9560)|
| 2:39:27| it's up to you to decide where that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9567)|
| 2:39:29| Yeah, and there's a process that we have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| Yeah, and the one thing we do have to need to do on that is always fill out that form and get it with the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| so they'll know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9576)|
| 2:39:38| But I found, you know, a couple of commissioners told me they've contacted these groups and asked for receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| I don't think we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9582)|
| 2:39:44| What we just need to do is wherever we give money to make sure that organization has a record with the clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9584)|
| 2:39:50| on who and what that organization is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9590)|
| 2:39:52| It's a simple one-page form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9592)|
| 2:39:56| And that was spelled out in the last audit that these need to be on record with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9596)|
| 2:40:03| Commissioner Shelf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| Mike, is this the same scenario?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9606)|
| 2:40:08| We got a fairly extensive e-mail from Hugh Holt the other day wanting to document what groups got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9608)|
| 2:40:16| and what progress they've made toward their goal and the four or five things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| We're talking about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| That was from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9623)|
| 2:40:25| I mean, I only came in with $400, so I've got two groups or one group I think I gave money to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9625)|
| 2:40:31| And that was from Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9631)|
| 2:40:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| I'll find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9634)|
| 2:40:36| Nobody else got that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| Yes, that's what I was going to ask a question about also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| All of the discretionary funds that are administered by commissioners, what do we have to do now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9641)|
| 2:40:47| What are you looking for us to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| If you have discretionary funds, and this is called out in audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9649)|
| 2:40:54| anywhere you give discretionary funds, that organization needs to be documented with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9654)|
| 2:41:01| And it's a little one-page memo that says who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| Well, I guess my question that I was trying to get back to was we have a process that this commission approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9666)|
| 2:41:13| Is there something that the mayor's office is saying that we need to do in addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9673)|
| 2:41:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9677)|
| 2:41:18| Just make sure when you give money that that organization you're giving it to is registered with the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9678)|
| 2:41:25| That being Foster Annette, is that who you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| And that being the form that we took whenever we took the request for funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9690)|
| 2:41:37| I think it's the same one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| I think it's the same form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| That's supposed to be part of the process in our paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9701)|
| 2:41:45| We turn it in to our office, which then goes to the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9705)|
| 2:41:49| She takes care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9709)|
| 2:41:50| And then it goes, you know, down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9710)|
| 2:41:53| So that should be taken care of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9719)|
| 2:42:01| If they're already registered with the clerk's office, do we have to fill that piece of paperwork out again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| If it's already registered with the clerk's office as far as all the information, I don't do it a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9732)|
| 2:42:13| I write on it that it's already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9733)|
| 2:42:18| 919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9738)|
| 2:42:19| Another mic can help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| Mike Reeves, Knox County Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9742)|
| 2:42:24| To answer your question, Commissioner Shouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9744)|
| 2:42:27| that was just a recap of that quarterly report that I believe that you all had asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| that they give a quarterly report recap of the position of the grants and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9753)|
| 2:42:39| And that letter actually came out of Hugh's office from Barbara Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9759)|
| 2:42:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| That's all it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| Just giving you an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9768)|
| 2:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9770)|
| 2:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9772)|
| 2:42:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9773)|
| 2:42:54| I'll go to contact now if I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9774)|
| 2:42:55| So thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9775)|
| 2:42:57| 919 on page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9777)|
| 2:43:00| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9780)|
| 2:43:04| approving the reorganization of the office of pretrial and probation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| by transferring the personnel duties, responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| and funding of the pretrial section of said office from the Knox County Mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9790)|
| 2:43:15| to the Knox County Sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9795)|
| 2:43:18| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9798)|
| 2:43:19| Finance, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9799)|
| 2:43:21| 10-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9801)|
| 2:43:23| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9803)|

| 2:43:27| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9807)|
| 2:43:29| Eight-0, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9809)|
| 2:43:31| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9813)|
| 2:43:37| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9820)|
| 2:43:41| As you know, I spoke against this at the finance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| Most of it is on finance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| Right now our county, you know, we're hurting from monies and revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9827)|
| 2:43:52| Four of these people will go in under the sheriff's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9832)|
| 2:43:56| This pension plan is hemorrhaging, like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| We got a report here this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| It looks like for the year that it's been in effect we've lost 22.5% of the money that we invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9840)|
| 2:44:06| You know we put, I believe, $3.4 million in it to shore it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9846)|
| 2:44:12| Our county, we spent $69 million more last year than what we took in in revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9852)|
| 2:44:21| $69 million more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9861)|
| 2:44:23| And, of course, we appropriated $20 million more this year out of the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| I don't know what it's going to be next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| I think that here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9869)|
| 2:44:30| We're trying to hold down cars, cut costs, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9870)|
| 2:44:36| And I know I don't have the votes to keep these people in the civilian population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| like if they come over into this sheriff's department like it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9880)|
| 2:44:45| Now, they can't go out and arrest anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9885)|
| 2:44:47| The warrants have to be signed by the judge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| The judge has to send them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9889)|
| 2:44:50| And normally they send the officer on the beat to arrest these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| So I don't know why these people need to be with uniformed officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9892)|
| 2:44:56| But even here and there, what I'm trying to say is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9896)|
| 2:45:00| if we put the pretrial into the sheriff's office and leave the probation where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| they've always been together more or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| we're going to have to get a director for the probation department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9907)|
| 2:45:10| We're going to have to furnish a car and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| I've talked to the sheriff, and he said he'd be glad to take both and transfer the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9914)|
| 2:45:21| Now, to hold down costs for Knox County and to keep them putting another car on the ticket,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9921)|
| 2:45:28| I think it would be better, and I'd like to amend this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| to just put the whole thing over in the sheriff's department with a budget of a million dollars that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9931)|

| 2:45:40| by not having to have another director over the probation department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090727?start=9940)|
