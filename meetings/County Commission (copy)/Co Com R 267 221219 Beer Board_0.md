| 0:20:35| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| I believe before we get into discussion item seven, we will interject this narrative given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| to us by the Knox County Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| Forgive me because of my lateness to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| I have not had a chance to look at this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| Would you mind giving us a summary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| So a brief rundown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| One of our narcotics officers stopped in that market to simply purchase a vape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| The cashier said, oh, no, you don't want that one, you want this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| She handed him a vape from behind the register in the cabinet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| He called the Tennessee Dangerous Drug Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| They came to Knoxville, ran a light test on it, and the legal amount of THC in a vape pen is 0.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| This one tested at 71.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| So he went back, said he wanted another one, purchased another one, obtained a search warrant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| which was executed on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| Not only did they find 24 of these same Honey King vape pens with THC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| they found tyanitine pills, which is a Schedule II narcotic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| It became illegal July 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| The owner said he had bought those a long time ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| but we found invoices from November 16th where he ordered 15 bottles of 100 pills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| So they were arrested on those charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1342)|
| 0:22:31| So the sheriff's office stance is he's selling narcotics at his business and he has a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| He does have violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| I don't have them pulled up in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I can pull those up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| But we would ask the board to suspend their beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| until we can get them in front of this board to talk about their narcotic violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| Thank you for that summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Director Book, could you advise this board what legally we are permitted to do in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| Well, as much as I'd like to say that you can suspend it until you can come to the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| he's entitled to due process, and that means he's entitled to come before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| be questioned by this board, raise any defenses, bring an attorney in and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| same as he will be in the criminal procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| It's a due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| I hate that we can't just automatically suspend it until then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| but I see nothing in the law that allows us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| There's a 1953 opinion of the Tennessee Supreme Court that says even though it's a privilege to sell beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| once you have a license it becomes a vested property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| That being the case, he's entitled to due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| and as much as I would like to agree with the sheriff's office, I don't think we can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1435)|
| 0:24:02| but we can certainly send them a citation to appear before this board in January and deal with it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1442)|
| 0:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Maybe he'll see the light before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I'll trust you to work with our county clerk then to see that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| I'll make contact with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| Do we need to vote on sending somebody a citation or anything like that to show up in front of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| I think we need to do a formal thing, and I don't know how the sheriff's office wants to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| but a formal citation, whether it's hand-delivered or just like any other, a summons to any kind of case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| Does this board need to take an action to process that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| Yes, I would suggest it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| This board made a motion to issue a summons to this permit holder to appear before this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1499)|
| 0:25:08| and answer the questions that are set out in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| And this is a public record document, as I understand, right, Sheriff, and attach this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Motion by Ward, second by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| Our office will prepare that if you like and make it easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| And then I don't know whether the sheriff wants to deliver it or whether it's certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Sometimes that certified mail, if they don't sign for it, it becomes a nullity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Yeah, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| It's a month away, so we can get it to them without problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| I'll do that, and we'll get that to you so you can serve it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Any further discussion at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| Thank you, Sheriff, for bringing that to our attention very, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| The next item, seven, discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| This was brought to us, I believe, initially by Commissioner Lee, and I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1577)|
| 0:26:26| they are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| My light's not coming on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Is there anyone here from El Tequila?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1601)|
| 0:26:54| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| I believe we'll need to have the Sheriff's Department come forward and read their report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| I'll defer to Lieutenant Tom Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| He's been fielding the complaints for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Lieutenant Walker, if you could give your name and residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| My name is Tom Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1635)|

| 0:27:21| Basically, what I've gotten is complaints from our patrol officers about fights and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| that have happened at El Tequila Bar that they've had to respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| I pulled the 911 call sheet, and they've had 31 calls for service there since July 1st of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| and this sheet went through November 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Most of them are for disturbance and fight calls, two medical calls, a bunch of thefts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| The biggest issue we had was on November 2nd of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| Our entire night shift had to respond to a, they called it a riot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| There were so many people fighting in the parking lot that we had to pull our entire night shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1678)|
| 0:28:03| into the area to take care of the people that were fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| Multiple arrests were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| We had officers assaulted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I have a use of force report that I've submitted to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| While the officers were there dealing with it, they saw children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| obviously under the age of 15 is how they put it in a report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| to include kids in strollers being pushed out of the bar during the fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1702)|
| 0:28:28| After everything got calmed down and they actually got everybody out of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| they interviewed the bouncers, and they said that they have fights there every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| that they are open, and most of them are not reported to the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| So the reports and the calls for service that we have are just a fraction of what's gone on at El Tequila in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| Before, if I may, Commissioner Lee, Director Book, would you advise this board on any action that could be taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1725)|
| 0:28:57| I think the permittee or co-permittee has a right to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Would you like to respond to those charges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| If you would like to respond, I would like to see what the police say about all the fights in El Salvador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1747)|
| 0:29:14| I repeat, there were those fights outside, but not as they are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1754)|
| 0:29:20| The security that I'm telling you about is precisely because I wasn't doing my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| That's why I fired him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| That's why I fired him, but now we're going to organize much better, which I'm already fixing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| I already fixed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| That's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Mr. Castaneda would like to express the fact that he understands and very much is committed to step up the security of the establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1774)|
| 0:29:45| and prevent from a lot of these issues to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| He said he's got three people in the parking lot area, and he has four people inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1788)|
| 0:29:55| in which is an upgraded establishment, and what can happen, it cannot happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| One of the folks that he let go is the one who's been really saying a lot of stuff that's quite not true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1800)|
| 0:30:07| so he just wants to make sure that he understands and lets everybody know that he takes this very seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| and that he makes sure to step it up so that this will not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| Director Booth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| The beer ordinance provides that the permittee shall not permit disorderly and unruly behavior on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1822)|
| 0:30:33| or about the premises, and he shall maintain an orderly establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| It further goes, and this is at section 4-12, subsection O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| says the board may revoke or suspend any permit for sale of beer for consumption on premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1847)|
| 0:30:53| if in the operation management and control the permittee allows any minor to loiter, that's a bit vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| such place of business and the burden of ascertaining the age of the minor shall be upon the permittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| I point out right now that you've got a problem there because you go into a restaurant that's on premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1867)|
| 0:31:15| and kids go in all the time with their parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| It's more of a parental issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| This goes more toward delinquent, well, I don't want to say delinquent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| but children, teenage types that are hanging around hoping they could get some beer, that's the way I read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| It goes on at subsection P, the board shall revoke the permit of any permittee who operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| or allows his establishment to be operated in a disorderly manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| It shall be a prima facie evidence that a permittee's establishment is being operated in a disorderly manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| if disorderly conduct chronically occurs on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| If there's any breach of the peace or unusual disturbance on the premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| or if there is evidence that any violation of law has occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| that section would be the one that would be more applicable than a kid in a stroller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| because a kid in a stroller could be in any other place of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| Sir, if I could also make a point that this report happened at 1 o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| That's when the children were being pushed out in strollers, so I'm not seeing it being a restaurant to open that late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| Well, under our code, they could stay open on sale premises until 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| The state says midnight, but the state also allows the counties to change that up to 3 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| which this county did a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Bottom line is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| This is a due process issue with that proof you presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| If El Tequila, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| El Tequila is, as we talked about before, summoned before this board in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| This board has the authority upon hearing all the evidence to revoke the permit of any permittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| if this board finds that it's in violation of the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| I don't think this is a discussion item tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| I'm glad it's before the board and might suggest that we do the same thing with El Tequila| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1992)|
| 0:33:18| and summon them before this board for a hearing, a due process hearing in January, if that's what this board desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=1998)|
| 0:33:30| I'll make a motion for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| Commissioner Jay, if I may have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Sheriff's Office, was this a one-time, one-night occurrence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| or were there multiple occurrences over multiple time periods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| There's been 31 calls for service since January 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| Just since January, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| And then according to their bouncers, they have fights every night that are not reported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| because they just don't call the police when they're fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| I think it would be a good idea to also include that in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| I'll second the motion if somebody wants to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| Commissioner Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2050)|
| 0:34:16| Would you like to go ahead and make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Yes, I'll make the motion that we put that on the agenda for January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| Summons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| To do the summons as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| So we have a motion by Lee and Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| Do you still have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| You said there was 31 incidents since, at first I think you said July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| but now you're saying January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| If I said July, I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| It was January 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Do you have any idea how many of those occurred after midnight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2091)|
| 0:35:16| Only two happened before midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| The other two occurred after midnight or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| Did not Pigeon Forge just recently lower the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| they went from 3 a.m. to 1 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| that you had to close by 1 a.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| I'm not familiar with that one, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Commissioner, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| They did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2147)|
| 0:35:48| Mr. Castaneda, can you say a word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2150)|
| 0:35:51| Mr. Castaneda is saying that he dismissed a person that was helping with the security back in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| and he just wanted to know if you guys know who is actually calling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| because one of the threats that he gave Mr. Castaneda was that he'll make sure to shut you down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| and he'll make sure to make all the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| So he just wants to know if you all know who is making those calls or just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2171)|
| 0:36:19| That's a discussion that will need to happen between now and your appearance next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| between him and certainly inquire with the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| or he may want to get an attorney in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| That's his decision to make at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2193)|
| 0:36:37| As far as any further discussion, I hear our law director saying we've been advised to just wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| until the charge is formal and that you are summoned to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| So we have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| Is there any other business to come before this board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| Do they understand what's going on, that we're going to summon them to the next January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-beer-board?start=2224)|
