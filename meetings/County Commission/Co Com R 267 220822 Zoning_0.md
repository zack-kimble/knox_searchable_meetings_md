| 0:02:49| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Mr. Anderson. Oh, yes, sir. If you'll please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| And if you will state your name and address, please, for the clerk's record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=178)|
| 0:03:05| So my name is John Wofford. Stuart Anderson, not able to be here, so I'm in his absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=185)|
| 0:03:14| My address is 1712 Evening Shade Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=194)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Is there any opposition to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| Seeing none, I'll look to Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve the Sector Plan Amendment to NC Neighborhood Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| because it is consistent with the adjacent development by a vote of 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=211)|
| 0:03:36| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| Did you want to speak, Mr. Anderson, on behalf of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=218)|
| 0:03:42| You're not Mr. Anderson, my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Did you want to speak for Mr. Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Not necessarily, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| Okay. Well, I'll look to my fellow commissioners if there are any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| And, Madam Clerk, let the record reflect Commissioner Ward is present at the meeting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| Welcome, Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| He may not be able to take this. I'm sorry, Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| I can speak to this for just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| Oh, certainly. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| This is a rezoning for a use that was initially being sought after in the BP zone, Amy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=248)|
| 0:04:18| I can't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Anyway, that led to an appeal to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=260)|
| 0:04:27| These that are deferred, items 72 and 73, have been deferred so that this rezoning process could go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| The parties that were appealing the initial use, as I understand it, have dropped their opposition as long as it's rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| So this rezoning should take care of these appeals that have been deferred tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| Just to give you some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=287)|

| 0:04:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=293)|
| 0:04:56| So the chair will look to a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=296)|

| 0:05:10| Any further discussion or questions from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=310)|

| 0:05:38| I see the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| If you wouldn't mind, sir, just for the clerk's record, state your name and address one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=339)|

| 0:06:18| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| Just for clarification, Mr. Moyers, did you say it reflected 72 and 73?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=381)|
| 0:06:34| Initially, this is for an automotive repair shop, basically, a body shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=394)|
| 0:06:44| although they were calling it an automotive remanufacturing facility for Harpers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| And initially, I think the property was at zone BP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| Actually, I think your item number 66 might be the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| Have I got that wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| I haven't spoken with District Forester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| I believe that's his item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| I think that's the correct one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| So it is not connected to 72 and 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Oh, I thought it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=430)|

| 0:07:19| My bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=439)|

| 0:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=442)|

| 0:07:27| That's by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=449)|

| 0:30:26| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1827)|

| 0:30:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Mr. Kirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| How many units do you plan on putting here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| Units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| It just depends on what all we can fit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| We've hired an architect firm to start creating a master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| to organize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| But our goal is to do anywhere from duplexes to sixplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| and kind of do a cul-de-sac in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| but obviously adhere to all the buffer zones and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| Mr. Snowden, did you check TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| to see if that were required in the turn lane there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| We can work with TDOT on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| I think that section is currently striped for a center turn lane now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| so there may be some markings that would have to be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| The asphalt pavement is at least there to accommodate for the left turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| No, it would be a right-hand turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| Oh, you're talking about a de-sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| We could look and do a count and verify the need for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| Do you know what that count usually is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| You look at the vehicles turning right and the following vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1894)|
| 0:31:41| and there's just a chart that you count the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| and then if it's so much, it's over that threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| So I don't remember the exact amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| but those are the two primarily things you're looking at is number of right-turners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| and following vehicles to minimize the disruption to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| So if it was the maximum five-per-acre, it would be about 22, 23 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1920)|
| 0:32:09| two to three cars per unit that would be turning in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| Is that a low number in your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1933)|
| 0:32:20| Just from on the cuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| I wouldn't necessarily think a right-turn lane would be warranted due to the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| at this location, your distribution might be 50-50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| because Chapman Highway is pretty close to the East End,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| and Alcoa Highway obviously is the draw on the West End.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| So the time you split that traffic up, maybe going half and half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| it's potentially unlikely that a right-turn lane may not be warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| You're familiar with this curve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| Hopefully, if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| the entrance there would not be where the entrance is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| there at the guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| You might be able to pull it up on Google Earth or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1983)|
| 0:33:06| In your opinion, where would that entrance—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| do you think that entrance would be there where it is currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| or will it be—do you think it will have to be moved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| That's in that sharp curve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| There's that one public road that's on the west side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| where their property comes to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| So for their advantage and for separation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| I think we would want to get that intersection as far to the—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| I guess that would be to the east as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| to get it into that tangent section of roadway for improved lines of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| So I would think it would be beneficial from several factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| to move the intersection to the east or towards Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2023)|
| 0:33:48| That's where it is now, so it can't be moved any farther east than it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| The current entrance right away there through that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2033)|
| 0:34:01| I don't feel comfortable on this one going up to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| It's a triangular shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| There's—Mr. Curry, you know you've got a lot of conditions there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| And at Planning Commission, you wanted to remove all those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| Yes, and since then we've been working with an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| and we don't think there's going to be any issues at all with those conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| And I had to call Mr. Romas to stop you from clear-cut clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| which that was one of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| We only bush-hogged that property, so—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| We've only bush-hogged the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| We haven't cleared anything as far as trees or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| We just basically mowed—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| I don't feel—I really don't feel anything up to five for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| I don't even really feel anything above two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| So I'm just going to make a motion that we leave it to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2090)|
| 0:35:00| Motion by Commissioner Daley to approve this rezoning to PR at one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2100)|
| 0:35:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| Second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2109)|
| 0:35:11| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Ms. Brooks, what—I'm trying to pull up the map to see what's around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| There is a range of zoning in the general vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| There's RB, which allows up to 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| There's CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| There's AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| There's PR to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| And, of course, as you get closer to the Mountain Grove Drive, you get into city zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| Additionally, there's the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| There's a variety of designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Of course, this is in the LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| It's adjacent to General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| And just to the east there is medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| And then further to the north is MDRO, as well as some GC there along Governor John Sevier and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| So it's a little bit of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Is there sewer in that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Any further discussion from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| There's a proper motion before us by Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| to approve this rezoning with a density of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2196)|

| 0:36:44| A few noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2204)|

| 0:37:04| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2227)|

| 0:37:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Any of the passes wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| The vote is four ayes, two noes, and four passes, so that motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Yes, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| I think we, if I remember correctly, we have to take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| So we're kind of back to where we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| If I could just open up the floor, I don't know if there's a question for Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| Daley or our planning representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| I guess my, when I look at the map, I look at everything from houses that are one unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2274)|
| 0:38:01| an acre, and then right next door is general commercial, and then right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| is medium density, which is how many units an acre could be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2286)|
| 0:38:11| Up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Up to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| I mean, one seems like on the low end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Obviously, five may be on the high end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| I'm wondering if there's some compromise to be able to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| I don't know enough about what your plans are for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Could we pull up a map there so I can show you guys on the main screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| Is it just a map of something you can find online, or are you looking for the case file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| Just a tax map or something so I can kind of show you what the idea was there, but maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| that would give you guys a little bit better understanding of what we're going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| Are you looking for the file, something that's in the file now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Oh, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Just somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Do you guys have a tax map that you can pull up to show you what it actually looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| on a map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Yeah, I mean, it's in our file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| It shows we have a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| So it's a triangle right there, and what we're going to do, like Carson said, where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| right now, that entrance is on that railing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| I think the idea was to put that on the far end and make it more accessible, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| just do a cul-de-sac going down to the far back right side corner, and adhering to all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2355)|
| 0:39:24| the 50-foot buffers, adhering to all the setbacks and everything like that, and doing just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| straight cul-de-sac, and just having small multifamily units on both sides of that cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:35| Ms. Brooks, do you know right across the street what those size lots are, roughly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| I mean, is that half acre, an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Probably a range of half acre to an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| I'm just glancing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| I can measure them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| I mean, if you look at the aerial, it will give you a sense of how it's currently developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| which is different than what it's zoned and what the plan designations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| I can measure those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Yeah, because if you're looking at the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| If you'll scroll down on that, there's an actual aerial photo of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| Obviously, we're looking at some houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| I don't know which direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| I guess it would be southwest that obviously are bigger lots across the street, smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| lots, and then everything...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| There's another picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| But everything to its east, essentially, could be commercial at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| Where those houses are right there, because the property is so narrow in that corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2436)|
| 0:40:42| that would be basically the entrance, and you wouldn't be able to start building until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| you get back about halfway into that triangle, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Because, again, it's so narrow on that left side where it's adjacent to that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| nothing can be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Yeah, I'm thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| If I was looking at the same picture and it was the general commercial was built out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2459)|
| 0:41:05| then we would be considering something that's a buffer between a transition, sometimes land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| use, between general commercial and single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| And so it probably would actually warrant a higher density, but obviously that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| built out yet, so it's looking in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| I guess I would open it up to Commissioner Daley as the district representative to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| out if there's not an action by the body to take one unit an acre, if there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2488)|
| 0:41:35| between one and five that seems appropriate to be able to take some action tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2495)|
| 0:41:45| We need to take some action to what we would call to the east, that kind of open spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2505)|
| 0:41:54| That is CP, but that is Knox Chapman's pumping station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Knox Chapman, that's a utility station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| There's not going to be anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| The next piece of property up is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| That's GC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Yeah, it says CB over there or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| That's owned by Knox Chapman Utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| The next piece of property up is the woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| That's going to be about 240 some odd apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| There needs to be a buffer in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| This is rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| It is still rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| There needs to be a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I see these large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| You can see these lots across the Johnston Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| They're large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| They're not residential or rental lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| These are large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| This is one time that I agree that it needs to be state rule in that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| It's a triangular shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| It's on a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| It's Stock Creek watershed comes down through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| I don't know if it's going to be a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| That's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Engineering can talk about all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| I know you're piqued up because of that stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| but we're trying to clean that stream up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| We spent hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to clean up Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| I still think one's good, but like I said, no more than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| It's just not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| There's not much more to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| If you want to make a motion for two per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| I'll make a motion for two per acre and see if that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| If it pleases the body, I'll make a motion for two units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| and see what the body thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| A motion by Commissioner Jay with a second by Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| to approve this rezoning density of two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| Item 72 and 73 are deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| Before we read item 74 and need to entertain a motion on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2647)|
| 0:44:14| I'd like to move into public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| because we have had a number of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| who have requested to speak on item 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| It's not a zoning item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| We don't have a in favor of it or in opposition thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| It's for the commission to debate and vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| but we are going to allow a public forum segment of zoning meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| I'm just going to call the names I have on my list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| that have requested to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| If you're here, you'll come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| You'll be given up to five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| The first name I have on my list is David Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| Is Mr. Lee here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| Mr. Lee, if you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| you have five minutes to address the commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| My name is David Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I live at 4519 Owanna Drive, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| I'm the president of Town Hall East,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| a neighborhood association with about 100 paying members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| that's now entering its 52nd year of existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| Commissioners Lundy and Beeler are our representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| The study presented to you by the Knox County Planning Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| shows pretty clearly that very few appeals went to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2736)|
| 0:45:42| so the idea that the current process constitutes a lot of red tape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| does not hold water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| It's a great slogan, but there really is no tape to cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| Similarly, there are few housing units involved in the appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| and even fewer for which no compromise could be found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| Given the numbers, appeals to the BZA versus to the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| are not going to have any appreciable effect on housing costs and availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2770)|
| 0:46:17| Rather than red tape, what this measure will cut for sure and certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| is neighborhood and citizen input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| and for that reason we oppose the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Thank you, Mr. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Eric Johnson is the next speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2793)|
| 0:46:42| Good evening, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| If you'll state your name and county of residence, you have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| My name is Eric Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| I live at 438 Mayfield Avenue in the Vestal Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| I'm here representing the Vestal Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| I serve as president of the Vestal Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| We are opposed to requiring appeals of development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| or uses on review to be filed directly with the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| We ask that you direct those appeals to the local board of zoning appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| the way it has been done for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| Our neighborhood is in the city and borders on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| This proposal impacts our input for any development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| proposed on county parcels adjacent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| With development plans, the devil is in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2848)|
| 0:47:35| We know that sometimes it's not always possible to get that worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| at the planning commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Appeals to BZA provide that opportunity to further work out the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| Once again, I'm representing the Vestal Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| We would like you to ensure that those appeals continue to be sent to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2873)|
| 0:47:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Wes Breitenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2884)|
| 0:48:12| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2892)|
| 0:48:13| If you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| you have up to five minutes to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| Wes Breitenbach, Knox County, District 2, 726 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2897)|
| 0:48:25| You guys are here to represent us and our voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| and by going with this, you're going to take away our voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| You're going to make it more difficult for us to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| I saw a lot of things brought up on the agenda tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| and not a lot of opposition, and I see quite a bit of opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| So I'd really like you to consider opposing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2921)|
| 0:48:47| because we deserve better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| We deserve to have easy access to government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| and to have our voice heard easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| We've been doing this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| It's not broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| Don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| If there's something that you see a problem with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| I suggest going after that, but this is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Nobody's complaining about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| So, again, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Please let our voice be heard and don't stifle it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| because that's what this process will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| We're stepping backwards by taking this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you, Mr. Breitenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| Robert Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2961)|
| 0:49:31| Good evening, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| State your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| How's the volume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| I don't want to blow your ears out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Robert Thompson, Knox County, 37920, District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| You've heard a lot about legalities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| and Mr. Moyers and I have ran around before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| and I didn't want to dwell on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| but legalities did come up again earlier this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| so I wanted to speak briefly, and I did want you to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| I gave you a handout, Mr. Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| I'm sorry you didn't get the hard copy yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| but I emailed it this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| I did want you to see in the hard copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| how the county reacted in 1991,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| following the Browning-Ferris opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| and you see it there, whereas the county said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| the Court of Appeals for the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| has ruled that appeals from decisions from MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| must be heard before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| They changed the name of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| from Adjustments and Enforcements to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| So that's what the court said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| That's how the county has applied it in the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| Now that, of course, the Browning-Ferris case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| that was about uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3040)|
| 0:50:44| but the logic of it applies every bit, 100%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| the same to development plan appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| Both uses on review and development plan appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| those are both administrative processes in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| and that's a key distinction which the courts have noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| It goes to court review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| It depends on how the court will review it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| depending on if it's legislative or administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Now, I heard Mr. Sale speak earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| and he mentioned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| He said, well, Shelby County and Nashville don't do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| They don't have a BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| But again, those are legislative processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Those counties have chosen to go a legislative process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| which has been pointed out to you is a slower process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| than what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| We have an administrative process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| And in the last two and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| there have been over 100 development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| over 8,000 units that have been approved quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| not having to go through you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| You haven't had to touch those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| and only a handful of those have been appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| not even a drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| It's just a molecule in the bucket that gets appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| None of those appeals have turned down any dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| We have heard claims that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| the zoning ordinance distinguishes between uses on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| and development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| But again, they are both administrative processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| In fact, as has been pointed out a few weeks ago, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| in the plan commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| because development plan is a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| and it's also been pointed out that every other section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| in the zoning ordinance, including residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| very similar wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| So attempting to split hairs between planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| and planned residential, that really is splitting hairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| But regardless of what the zoning ordinance says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| regardless of the hairs that can be split there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| the Browning-Ferris opinion made it clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| this is a state law matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| This overrides whatever the zoning ordinance said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| That's what happened in Browning-Ferris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| The county commission tried to amend the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| to say we at county commission will be the appeal body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| And the court said, well, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| That's contrary to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| That's still the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| I know Mr. Morris has disagreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| but you have to recognize this is real.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| This is a real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| And I'm not a voice in the wilderness crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| I have discussed this with several other attorneys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| who agree in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| There was one that was willing to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| He does not have a dog in the fight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Mr. Cliff Rogers, 23-year federal court employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| That's in your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| He agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| So it's a state law matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3218)|
| 0:53:45| So Ms. Nolan this afternoon spoke and she mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| well, there's an advantage of predictability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| in going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| And there are two things that I would predict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| I think we can predict about going to court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| if this goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| One, you can predict that appeals will take much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I don't think anybody disputes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| So where is your increase in efficiency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| You can predict it will take longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| I think if it goes to court of appeals, it takes years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| The second thing you can predict,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3257)|

| 0:54:20| without having been through BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3260)|

| 0:54:24| did you not read the Browning-Ferris opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| We told you this 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| Thank you, Mr. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3274)|

| 0:54:48| Good evening, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| If you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| you have up to five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Thank you, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| for letting us have another public forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| There is a lot of concern about this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| I live at 3350 Deep Cove Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| I'm in Commissioner Ward's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| And I'm representing the HOAs of Mariners Point and Viewpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| which has 97 houses and over 300 residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| And we feel strongly about keeping the rights that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| for the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| I've lived in Knox County for 45 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| and for the last 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| we have had the right to appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| And it hasn't caused a lot of red tape and a lot of delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| It gives the citizens and the developer a month or two to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| and reach some kind of accommodation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| some kind of compromise to make the development less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| objectionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| And it's usually worked out in the 15,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3362)|
| 0:56:06| 16 times over the last 15 years that this appeal has been used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| this route has been used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| It has worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| So we're asking you to not take away a right that we've enjoyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3375)|
| 0:56:23| and have not abused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| but something that has contributed to more sensible development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| that hasn't raised the cost of housing and development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| hasn't dragged out the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| And so, again, we're simply asking you to keep this right in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| As we go forward and as this county continues to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| and attract more people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| let's do it in a way that is acceptable to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| Thank you, Mr. Wiseman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| Julie Fritz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3426)|
| 0:57:20| Good evening, Ms. Fritz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| You will state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| You have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| I wasn't sure my name got on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| I did it late, but thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| My name is Julie Fritz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| I live in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Ms. Terry Hill is our representative with District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| I know that we were a large crowd last month and we're here again in numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| and I don't want to break the issue of the court issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| with all of this zoning, the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| but I will say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| And as a citizen in our community and in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| if this were to go to court, the plaintiffs, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| would have an exponential cost, and once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| the developers and the builders have an exorbitant amount of financial gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3489)|
| 0:58:16| So this court case could go on forever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| and the plaintiff kind of being already disadvantaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3500)|
| 0:58:32| Many people that I've spoken to in and around the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| who I am friends with, find that they don't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| I know voter turnout was very low this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| And you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| Because of things just like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| They feel like their voices are not heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| There's no reason to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| They're wasting their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| And I hate that because men and women have given us the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| to be able to stand here today and to have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| And we, as citizens of this community and of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| do not want our voices to ever be silenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| And if this passes, that's exactly what is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| That is what we are going to see as an end result of you all voting yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| Last month, there was a gentleman that stood here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| and when he talked, I really took this to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| And he said, you all are our elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| We elect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| We are your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| You all represent our voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| And this last election, I really, really took that to heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3574)|
| 0:59:40| In fact, a lot of people that I know, that I spoke with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| they took that to heart as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| There was one race that I didn't vote straight down the electrical ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| I changed my vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| And a lot of it had to do with this right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| and the reason that we are having to be here, to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| to have our voices heard and to present our information to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3602)|
| 1:00:10| I really feel like this timing is very ironic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| It happened right before an election for some of our county officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| And now we're back once again after the election is now finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| So I'm a little bit, I'm not sure that I buy into that it just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| And I hate to be skeptical about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| but that is very eye-opening to a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| They're like, well, timing is just a little bit off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3636)|
| 1:00:43| I know that Glenn Jacobs commented the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| that we're in a housing shortage and a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| I, for one, and I am so sick of hearing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| Look at our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| We're not in a housing shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| Oh, my gosh, come to Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| We've got houses going up on every corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| We always hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| And when you take that opportunity of the people to voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| if they have a zoning issue or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| you take that voice away for them to present information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| And like a gentleman said, work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| You know, come to the table and have some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| And so anyway, when that happens, we have a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| You all can work with us, and we would greatly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| On November the 19th in 1863 was the Gettysburg Address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| President Lincoln spoke these famous words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| and this has been lost today in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3705)|

| 1:01:55| If you vote yes in changing this zoning appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| you have taken those words away from the people in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| and in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Do more than just hear us, listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| Have our voices heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Do not shut us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3737)|

| 1:02:21| There will be another election come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3741)|
| 1:02:23| and it wasn't completely a runaway this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| and I think people will go to the ballot box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| the ones that do vote, and they will have their say at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3750)|

| 1:02:39| Those are our signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3759)|

| 1:02:58| Hello, Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| If you'll state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| My name is Ronnie Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| Knox County, 4606 Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| Hallisville, Spring Hill community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| I've been president of that organization for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| I can tell you right now that I can only remember two times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| in 30 years we've actually been to BZA to fight something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| or appeal something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| And when we were first organized, we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| if you're a community, we had Easttown Mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| and we had the Home Depot being built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3816)|
| 1:03:40| and that was pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Since then, we've had Walmart, Sam's, Kohl's, Target, everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| all kinds of fast food, not a hiccup on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| So growth has not been a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Lowe's in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| So I just want you to understand that I was here last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| when this was voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| I didn't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| I stood in the back with a sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| and I watched 18 different people get up here and speak against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| that represent neighborhood associations from all across Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| I saw two people get up here and speak for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| and I can't understand those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| I don't understand that it seems to me that I know over experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| for all the years I've been around that when elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| go to pursue for an office, who's the first people they go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Neighborhood organizations and ask for support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| because they know that's who's going to put them in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| That's all we ask, that you listen to us, that you're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| like I say, that's the first people that you usually go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| because you know that's how to get votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| and get elected into an office to represent the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| and that's what we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| I know when we started, I think, appeal, I just off the head numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| it was like $50 to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| Now the cost is $200 on the county side for this, and I may be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| Ms. Brooks could probably tell me, but in the city, I believe, is it $500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| That's what I've, so that's, I mean, we can't really afford stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| like that to happen very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| so we're very picky about the way we appeal and do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| If the court, if you have to go to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| which is what's being suggested to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| there's no way we could afford to fight anything in court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| so we're just stuck out and no recourse at all in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| There's no way we can do anything about it, so I'm just trying to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| And then one other thing I want, this chart that you were just giving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| as the previous person said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| this is slowing down the building process in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| and having trouble getting enough houses built and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| Look at this chart. Where did it go from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| I mean, in 2010, there was 827,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| and 2019, I mean, the numbers, they're growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| I mean, it's like, I mean, off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| that's three to four times as much that's going on now in the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| than there was in 2010, so I don't see where the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| And I don't understand why doing away with BZA has anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| It's only helping one set of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| It's not helping the neighborhoods, and they're the ones that vote and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4021)|
| 1:07:06| Just want you to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| And if you look, if you've seen this chart on here, which is in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| it does tell on here that there's 2,500 more dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| were approved through the development plan process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4040)|
| 1:07:23| than builders actually pulled permits for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4043)|
| 1:07:26| Yes, there was a lag between units approved at planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| and then there were actually built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| but we have two years with extremely large gaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| 1,000 units more approved each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| than building permits approved in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| That don't sound right to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| There's something wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| I just can't figure out why that the BZA, like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| for a man that's been doing this for over 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| and only have two instances that we actually went and had to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| that can't be slowing things down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| If you looked at our community and where we're located and what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| including the new Amazon facility whenever it starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| we just ask you to support us in this movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| Thank you, Mr. Collins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4105)|
| 1:08:35| Evening, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| We'll state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| You have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| My name is Herb Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| I reside at 8501 North Rollins Ferry Pike, Strawberry Plains, 37871.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| Over the last few months, I'm sure that many of you have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| from your constituents concerning this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| and I hope that our community has made it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4137)|
| 1:09:01| that we want the right to appeal the development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| People want that right and has been stated many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4147)|
| 1:09:12| That's why we elect who we elect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| to have those folks represent us and listen to our wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4155)|
| 1:09:22| This matters to the community because we understand that oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| through the planning process and the application process of developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| there are things that may not be considered by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| and others who go through the approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| and it may be overlooked, unintentional or intentional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| or not even considered what the community might think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| So we want to have that opportunity to appeal anything that we feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| is not in harmony with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| or if it's detrimental to the lifestyle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| the character of whatever community is represented or in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| We want at least the right to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| The BZA proposal has been called away to cut red tape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| and to streamline the process and has been stated before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| that that appears not to be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4222)|
| 1:10:26| because of the small number of things that have become before the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4226)|
| 1:10:32| and also has been mentioned the expense for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| as well as the opponents to litigate this in courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| From a time frame standpoint, I can't help but think that the BZA process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| would be speedier than the way the courts are backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| The idea that it would be streamlined in lawsuits in courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4252)|
| 1:10:58| in our minds, doesn't hold a lot of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| We need to have a speedy appeal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| and if the Board of Zoning Appeals heard last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| that they had problems at times during the COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| and they get in a quorum and they wouldn't be able to consider certain appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4276)|
| 1:11:21| well, I know this body and the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| had the Zoom meetings and virtual meetings and all like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| and to my knowledge, I don't think they missed a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| So the BZA, if that's a problem, getting a quorum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| we need people on the BZA that can attend, or at least virtually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| The goal of this proposal is obvious, not to have more lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| The perceived goal by some in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| is to discourage citizens from appealing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| Every citizen who spoke against the proposal in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| at the public hearing understands this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| Every citizen you see in the audience tonight knows this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| And what justification for the proposal has been provided to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| No facts at all, just the various speculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| just buzzwords, streamlining, cutting red tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| Those phrases are well-meaning, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| but they're not necessarily what this proposal would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4346)|
| 1:12:36| Planning Commissioners were told that there's been a tremendous increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| in the appeals being filed, but the trend has been mentioned also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4359)|
| 1:12:44| is not that over the last 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| The supporters of the resolution have had months to convince you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| that there is an actual rationale for this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| During that time, the community has provided actual numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| and it's already been stated 8,000 housing units were approved since 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4378)|
| 1:13:05| with only 161 of those units being involved in appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4385)|
| 1:13:12| We have called to your attention the possible legal risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| of what this law, under the state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| no zoning ordinance amendment may be made effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| unless it is first submitted to the Regional Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| for approval, disapproval, or suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| Our Planning Commission has not considered the current amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| which is substantially different than what was considered to them in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| considered by them in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| In the absence of any compelling reason to pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| your constituents, not just the people that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| are left puzzled over how this is being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| in the face of the overwhelming opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| lack of justification, and legal risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| If you feel that this might be justified resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| then you can give the sponsors a postponement for another month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| and let them have more of a chance to convince you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| Otherwise, we ask that you amend this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| and codify the plan appeals go to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| I did a little math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Back in July of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| there was a statement made from our Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| that I believe the number was 40,000 new homes by 2050.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4468)|
| 1:14:36| I may not be exact on those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| If I did my math at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| it was around 1,724 homes per year during that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| We have many more permits issued in Knox County during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4487)|
| 1:14:54| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| This is the conclusion of our public forum for the zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4502)|
| 1:15:08| Thank you all so much for your participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| and for being willing to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Commissioners, I would like to take a brief recess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| before we take up debate on this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| since it is our last item of the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| We will stand in recess until 825.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| Commissioners, we're about to call the meeting back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4527)|
| 1:15:58| I call this zoning meeting back into order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Madam Clerk, if you would please read Item 74.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| It's Ordinance O-22-6-104,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| an ordinance amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| Article VI, entitled Administration, Enforcement, and Interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| by amending Subsection 6.40.01 and 6.50.07| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| and adding a new subsection 6.50.08| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4583)|
| 1:16:27| to provide for the development plan appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| to a court of competent jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130 adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| I have a motion to approve this ordinance by Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| with a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| I have just a quick question for the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| and then I have several things I'd just like to share with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| Our very first public speaker, well, not our very first public speaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| but Mr. Thompson, I believe, who's given us a copy of his email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| and sent it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| has argued that essentially the legality of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| based upon some state precedents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| So I want to just sort of start with that and ask Mr. Moyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| if he would try to briefly summarize the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| and then respond to that as the lawyer for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| In, I believe it was 1990, the BFI case was decided in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| The Court of Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| And that case was in the main about whether or not the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| could reserve to itself the right to hear use on review appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| And the Court of Appeals said no, it could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| In talking about that, the court sort of passed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| people can still have a route of appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| because they can go to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| And the court, in coming to that conclusion, relied sort of based on state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4690)|
| 1:18:15| and the Knox County Zoning Ordinance, Section 6.60.03,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| which they specifically cited in coming to that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| That has been taken to say that therefore the state law requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4704)|
| 1:18:29| that these appeals go to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| And I just, in my opinion, based on my best reading of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| We can allow them to go to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| That's what this commission has chosen to do for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| Although, as I've argued in the past, clearly it has for uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| It has not, by the plain reading of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4734)|
| 1:18:59| chosen to do that for development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| which are a different kind of animal than uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| And I know a number of people have stated in the public forum this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| that this ordinance would take away from the BZA use on review appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| It would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Use on review appeals would still go to the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| The only thing that would not under this ordinance would be development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| which, as I read the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| have never been properly before the Board of Zoning Appeals at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| based on the way the code is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| But to the extent that the argument is being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| that the state law requires that these go to the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| as I mentioned the last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| I found a more recent case than the BFI case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| called Rogers Group versus County of Franklin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| And in that case, the County of Franklin had adopted a zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| and it gave their Board of Zoning Appeals the right to hear appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4796)|
| 1:20:01| and I will read the language to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| there is an error in any order, requirement, permit, decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| implication, determination, or refusal made by the building commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| or other administrative official in carrying out the enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| of any provision of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Now, that's the same language that is used in the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| in referring to the authority of the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| that very language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| And so I want to stress, again, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| to hear the appeals of decisions made by the building commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| or other administrative official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| That's the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| In this case, in Rogers Group case, the question was directly asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| when the language says other administrative official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| does that include the planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| And the Court of Appeals said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| And they said no for reasons that have everything to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| with all the rules of statutory construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| When you are construing a statute, you do not stretch the meaning of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| You give them their ordinary, natural meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| You don't assume that a statute overlooked something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| You assume that every word was used with purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| But the Court of Appeals said, and what I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| is that if the intent of the legislature was to say that the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4876)|
| 1:21:23| Appeals had authority to hear appeals from the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| it would have said the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| The planning commission is mentioned multiple places in the same statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| and yet they never say the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| They say the building commissioner or other administrative official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| So I do not believe that that language is broad enough to implicate the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| The court in the Rogers Group case did not think so either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4908)|
| 1:21:53| An argument could be made, and certain people have made the argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4913)|
| 1:21:57| that we cannot do anything that's different than what we are specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| authorized to do by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| If that's the case, the argument could be made that the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| doesn't have any appellate authority over any decision of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4926)|
| 1:22:13| But this commission has chosen to give it that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| And I think, because I'm inclined to read our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| and its power as expansively as I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| I believe that we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| I was asked last month by somebody in the audience, maybe a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4947)|
| 1:22:33| could we instead give the BZA the authority to hear development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| and I said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| This commission can do with the Board of Zoning Appeals whatever it wishes to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| I believe, consistent with the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| So at that point, the legalities are taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| and it just becomes a matter of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| And that is your business, not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Thank you very much, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| Bear with me, commissioners, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| I have a significant number of notes I'm trying to walk through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| I went back this weekend and reviewed everything on this ordinance from day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4987)|
| 1:23:13| I went back to every note, every part and piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| I went back to every, even the sit-down I had with many of the planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| or a couple of the planning members here, what's before us, and tried to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| I don't know how we got started here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| I don't know what the justification was to begin this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| I'm not the sponsor of the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| But here we are regardless of how we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| We have to take some action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| So I did go back to the current law, and as outlined clearly by our lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| our law director, in the memo and the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| nowhere in our current ordinance or law does it say development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| should be appealable to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| It's just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| As it was noted in Mr. Sales' comments earlier on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5038)|
| 1:24:06| there is some question about sort of who has more authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| one appointed body overruling another appointed body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| but that goes down a rabbit hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| I then sort of backed up and said, okay, if it's not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| then what would happen right now, today, let's say this whole thing was scrapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| I made a motion to table it, and everybody said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| we don't want to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| Everybody go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| Not even going to start it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| Here's kind of what would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| If we don't take some action, the Engineering and Public Works Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| who is a subset of Knox County under the direction of the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| will follow their lawyer's advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| That's the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| The next time a development plan is appealed, let's say for sake of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| continuing conversation, Mr. Murphy, were to file an appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| then the Engineering and Public Works Department would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| there is nothing in the code that says a development plan is appealable to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5106)|
| 1:25:11| because their lawyer has said it's not in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Regardless if people have been doing it for 20 or 30 years, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| We verified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| So the Engineering and Public Works, who oversees the codes department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| wouldn't consider an appeal on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| They wouldn't file it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| They wouldn't add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| And Citizen X, in this case I've used Mr. Murphy, would then have to sue the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| courts to say, no, we should be able to hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5137)|
| 1:25:41| Is that accurate so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| That would be the case, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| Because the Engineering and Public Works is saying the lawyer says you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| hear him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5149)|
| 1:25:50| It's not in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| You would have to sue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5151)|
| 1:25:52| And then a chancellor would decide in court whether or not it could be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5152)|
| 1:25:57| or it couldn't be heard, and then we're sort of back to step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| If the law department's version of this is accurate, then the chancellor would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| probably look at it and say it's not in the code, and therefore you can't file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| a develop appeal and go back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| And you can appeal everything else that has been currently appealed to BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| but you can't appeal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| And you essentially, the planning advocates here, essentially get nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5178)|
| 1:26:24| I mean, there's no, it's less than is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| So I'm wondering, like, why would you want that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| I mean, that's where we stand as we currently sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| So then, let me continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| Then I asked Engineering and Public Works to send me an example, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| shared this with all of the commission, the development plans and uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| I mean, show me examples of these that are filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| And they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| They showed several different development plans, several different uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| I reviewed all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| I looked through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| I read through every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| And it was clear to me that development plans are technical in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| And so I went back to Engineering and Public Works, Mr. Snowden, and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| okay, help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| Who signs off on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| Who approves these, you know, after the planning commission process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| And, again, correct me if I'm wrong, but I was told that development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| they have to be sealed, approved, and signed off by a licensed engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| or architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| They have to be licensed credentials to look at because it's about water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| hydrology or about curb cut diameters or grade or slope, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5245)|
| 1:27:32| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| So then I said, okay, so clearly development plans are way different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Uses on review are sometimes variances or setbacks or other minor things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| are more subjective, not engineering things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| So I asked for an example of a development plan that was appealed to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5268)|
| 1:27:53| when it really shouldn't have been, like an actual case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| And then I found a case from BZA on October 23, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5277)|
| 1:28:04| This was actually a meeting that I watched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| It was about a subdivision in Blue Grass Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| Mr. Thompson, I'm sorry, where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Mr. Thompson was actually on BZA at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5291)|
| 1:28:15| And it was an appeal to BZA on a development plan that was all about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5295)|
| 1:28:20| streamlined determination or wet weather conveyances or blue line streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5300)|
| 1:28:25| The whole appeal was the citizens said, we think this is an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5305)|
| 1:28:29| blue line stream, which would include certain protections, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| And in the planning commission, they said, well, is it a blue line stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5313)|
| 1:28:40| or is it a wet weather conveyance or is it a, you know, essentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| is it a real live stream or is it where the water flows in a wash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| And in that process, the planning commission said, well, look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| you developer go and get a hydrologist to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| And that was part of the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| That was part of the normal planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| They argued the citizen on behalf of Mr. Klein was the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| I watched this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| It was an hour and 42 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| It argued that if a waterway was a stream or not and if buffering was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| Engineering and Public Works argued a hydrologist actually did a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| determination and looked at the water and looked at it from a technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5357)|
| 1:29:21| standpoint, not the citizen or VA, but actually took hydrology expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5361)|
| 1:29:26| and determined it was not a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| It was just a where the water flowed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| And so at first, the BZA denied it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| And then they went back and forth and back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| And the hydrologist and the engineering department said, wait a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| They went through the entire planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Citizens got a voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| The planning department said, go get an expert hydrologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| The developer got an expert hydrologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| It said it's above board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| We will make sure we shape it accordingly and do all the wet weather stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| And the citizen still appealed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| And when they got there, it was sort of everybody was really confused as to like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| why are we even in this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| They asked for a technical response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| A technician looked at it and they said, this is not the issue that you think it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| and it should be moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| But as it went through the BZA meeting, it was really interesting because people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| on the BZA started to bring in all kinds of other things, emotion, conjecture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| assumptions, irrelevant information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| They were making decisions based upon flooding in their neighbor's yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5431)|
| 1:30:35| or a friend across the county or something they'd seen before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| instead of actually dealing with the technical nature of that development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| And only after Mr. Thompson sort of realized this was an impasse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5443)|
| 1:30:48| asked the developer, if you'll sit down and just explain this to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| then we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| They appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| They finally flipped the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| It was approved and they went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| All this to say this was a technical issue and a citizen said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| well, I just think it's a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| And that wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| And so it was a huge amount of time wasted to sit down and go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| And it really reinforced to me that the BZA as a second appointed body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5472)|
| 1:31:18| after the planning commission is designed to consider requests for adjustments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| light modifications, sort of the nuance of it, not technical ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| do you follow the code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| And it was just an interesting process to watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| So I went through that and then I went back through our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| and I said, okay, well, how did we even get to today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| I went back and I said, this was brought to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| We all sat here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| And I don't know if it was unanimous or if it was really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| We all said, this needs a little bit more vetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| We sent it to the planning commission and said, interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| we need you to really dig deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| They vetted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| They unanimously approved different recommendations and sent it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5526)|
| 1:32:12| Those are 14 members or 15 members appointed by city and county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| So this wasn't just the county mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| This was both members looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| They affirmed in their writing that development plans are not appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| It does not exist in our code and we should codify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| So they sent it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5550)|
| 1:32:31| We did our homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| We didn't just make a rash decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| And so then it brought us to today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| I went back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5559)|
| 1:32:40| I conferred with Ms. Brooks and looked at the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5560)|
| 1:32:44| And development plans do get citizen input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| They do go before a citizen appointed body for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| That's called the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| Public has input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Public can be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| Public can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| And so the idea that all the rights are taken away just doesn't pass the smell test for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| I mean, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| The rights that are being protested are second or third attempts at something that can be done in the first ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5588)|
| 1:33:16| Every one of you can go to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| You can write them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| You can stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| You can go as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| You can go and say to this appointed body that is city and county combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| we think something different and they can make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| So, again, let's go back to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| If we do nothing today, you will have way less rights than you will have under this current ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5615)|
| 1:33:43| The engineering department won't hear any of these appeals anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| It will go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| Likely a judge will say it's not in your code and you'll go back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| So in what's before you, there is actually a process to get a second bite at the apple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| Whether you like the process or not, that's a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| So I go back to my earlier statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| I believe, I do believe there was a reason that our laws did not include development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| Those are technical reviews and should remains in the hands of licensed technical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| that are bonded, insured, licensed, and have the experience to determine the technical aspects of a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| That is far different from use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Now, I don't love section four of this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| I think it actually leaves the door open to appeal development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| We spend the first three quarters of this ordinance saying it's not part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| and then we leave this door open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| But that door does have some consequences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| It says if you're going to go about through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| then each side has different rights to do different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| I don't love that part, but I'm not willing to sort of throw up the baby with the bathwater on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5690)|
| 1:34:59| It's not great, but it's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| We can always amend it down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| We can always continue to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| I do think that these should be separated, and that's why we'll be supporting the ordinance tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5706)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you for the time and the patience to be able to kind of walk through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| Commissioner Jay, thank you for your words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| I agree with you, and thank you, Mr. Moyers, for all your legal advice through this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| I just wanted to clarify and point out on Planning Commission, doesn't the citizen have a vote at Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5733)|
| 1:35:42| If there's opposition, doesn't that count as a vote against the plan that comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5742)|
| 1:35:46| No, they have the opportunity to speak on any item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| I thought there was a voting aspect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| If somebody shows up to Commission, there's that extra vote or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| No, just the 15 members of the Planning Commission make the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Commissioner Skidmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| I'm glad you got to, Commissioner Jay, you got to see the video of the BZA inaction on the Davis case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5765)|
| 1:36:13| I think if you recall, that whole process was wrapped up in about 65 to 68 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5773)|
| 1:36:23| so that from the point that it went through Planning Commission and it went to the first BZA appeal and to the second BZA appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5783)|
| 1:36:33| it was all finished by October 23, 2020, and everybody went home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| The decision was made, just like you said, about the blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| So the BZA appeal was all done and over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| The property was bought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| All that occurred prior to October 23, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| We've just gotten now the first grading permit was issued in May of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| and the first grading inspection was done in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| So now they're off to the races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| But had Mr. Davis gone to court, could he have resolved that in 65 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5825)|
| 1:37:13| I doubt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| I just personally doubt you could run that through the courts the way that needed to be in 65 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5835)|
| 1:37:23| So I just wanted to just bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| The other thing is, after serving on commission for a few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5845)|
| 1:37:31| I've never seen us do an ordinance where we have a caption to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5851)|
| 1:37:38| I don't think there's any ordinance in Knox County that says a party can opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5858)|
| 1:37:45| And so I really don't understand how we got to that point where we're going to make an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| and then give a party the option to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| The other thing is, I think Tennessee code annotated is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| It's extremely clear in 13.7.105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| And you all have seen the copy, but since we have so many people in the audience here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| it says that a county legislative body may, from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| amend the number, shape, boundary, area, or any regulation of or within any district or districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5896)|
| 1:38:23| for any other provision of carrying out any zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| But any such amendment shall not be made or become effective unless the same be first submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5908)|
| 1:38:35| for approval, disapproval, or suggestions to the regional planning commission of the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5915)|
| 1:38:44| When this first ordinance was proposed three meetings ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| it was substantially changed to what we see today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| The law director has already given you an opinion that it has substantially changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| That's why we went back to a first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| So I'm not going to vote to violate state law by voting on an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| that hasn't gone back to planning commission for that body to issue a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| and have a discussion and then send that recommendation back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| So I think we've got basically two options here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5961)|
| 1:39:25| Either one, we send this back by state law, back to NOx planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| to review the new ordinance because it's been dramatically changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5970)|
| 1:39:36| or two, we defer this for, say, 60 days where we can, as commissioners, as the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| as MPC, as our legal department, we can sit down and have a study session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| on this ordinance before we take any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| But I'm not going to violate state law by voting for something today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| that tells us what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| We do know what happened to some commissioners a few years ago when they violated state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| and we saw what happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| Thank you, Commissioner Stenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Mr. Law Director, would you opine on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| We often send things to MPC for a look at sector plans and different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6024)|
| 1:40:32| and they make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Would you please opine on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| The law is, as Commissioner Schoonmaker has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| any change must be sent to the Planning Commission for its approval, disapproval, or comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6042)|
| 1:40:49| But the case law is also clear that the County Commission is not bound by the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6049)|
| 1:40:55| or the findings of the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| You have to have their comments, but you don't have to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| That's almost a direct quote from one of the cases that I've looked at recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| If that were the case, there would be no need for this legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| We just have to do everything that MPC says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| That would be correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| And this matter was taken to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| They made their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| It is now before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| I believe it is properly before this body, and it's not violating any law for this commission to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| I still have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| I would like to get our experts in these fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| I will start with our Director of Engineering, Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6090)|
| 1:41:35| I would like your opinion on this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| You know, I'm a licensed engineer, so I'm a little bit, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6101)|
| 1:41:49| I guess I'm a little preferential, but these plans, concept plans and development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6109)|
| 1:41:55| are submitted by design professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| My staff review it, and they're design professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| And we oftentimes tell them, hey, this isn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6121)|
| 1:42:05| This horizontal curve, this vertical curve, this drainage needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| And I think that's the appropriate venue in which to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| to design professionals that are trained in those conversations to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| So, I mean, I feel like that a licensed engineer should be making commentary on design plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6139)|
| 1:42:27| and not someone that's unlicensed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| I would concur with Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| I would add that I think from the planning perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| I think one of the most important things for the planning process is that there is a clear appeal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6158)|
| 1:42:47| So as long as that is clearly laid out, there's a path to appeal any decision made by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| or administrative decisions by planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| I think that's what's most important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| You know, Mr. Hanson-Sales spoke of political will earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| And I know this is tough to sit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| I've sat here for eight years and have made decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| and it's hard not to give in to the political pressures of the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6194)|
| 1:43:21| But I look back, and a lot of the time that I've spent here in these zoning meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| it didn't happen tonight, but it normally does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| But we run into things like growth in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| And I remember back to a time when the county proposed five lanes for Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| and those in power, those leaders at the time, gave in to the pressures and only went with three lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| Now we sit here 20 years later, and we wish we had those five lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| that the people would have done what needed to be done then to be able to grow into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| And I look at it the same way with our growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| Nearly every month we struggle with more and more of our rural land being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| It's being used because political will wasn't there to reconvene the growth committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| and set aside pieces that could be developed in denser chunks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| instead of going two to three units rapid throughout all the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| So in a lot of ways, our inability to move the needle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| to step out a little bit and make some changes, paralyzes us in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| Now this is not the silver bullet to cure our housing crisis in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6269)|
| 1:44:38| but nor is it the dagger in the heart of public input into our zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| There's a lot of input that goes into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| Sector plans, general plans, zoning meetings, commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| I just think sometimes you have to be willing to do things in order to get things moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6292)|
| 1:44:58| So I hope you all will support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Schoonmaker, back to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| Mr. Law Director, I'm not an attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| but when I read something that says when we submitted the first proposal to Knox Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| yes, they reviewed that and came back with a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| There still seems to be some question as far as if the planning commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| actually got to see the ordinance in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| But anyways, so now the same ordinance that they approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| is not the same as what we're looking at tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| and that's because it is a substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| which you've already said is a substantial change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| and the reason why we had to go back to a first reading on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| So that's just my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| Again, it's a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| State law says this, that it should go back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| So at this point, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer any action on this for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6357)|
| 1:46:04| so that we can sit down and what they call summer study in the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6364)|
| 1:46:12| but we would have a study to find out exactly what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| because if this needs to go back to Knox Planning for review of what we're looking at tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6376)|
| 1:46:22| then we need to follow the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| I have a motion by Commissioner Schoonmaker, a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| to postpone this item for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| A second by Commissioner Lundy. Commissioner Schmitt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| Mr. Law Director, substantial change or out of an abundance of caution was your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6407)|
| 1:46:55| The change that was made was the addition of the language in, I think, the fourth section of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| that provided for a route of appeal to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| In my opinion, that was substantial enough to justify taking it back to first reading under the commission's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| I do not think it is substantial enough to require it to be resubmitted to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| They've already looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| That change that was made, I do not believe, would affect their recommendation in the slightest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| So, no, I do not believe that it would need to go back to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| Is there any further discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| Motion is made by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Lundy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| to postpone action on this item for 60 days or until,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| I'm going to state this, Commissioner Schoonmaker, and you can concur or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| that would be to the October zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6468)|
| 1:47:52| That's the motion before us. All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Does this not have to be a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Oh, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| No, it can be a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| We can do one. I mean, well, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6487)|
| 1:48:13| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6493)|
| 1:48:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6498)|
| 1:48:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6500)|
| 1:48:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| Commissioner Biggs is out. Commissioner Lundy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| Commissioner Durrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| Does anyone wish to change their vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6517)|
| 1:49:07| The vote is three ayes and seven noes. Substitute motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| We're back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| Is there any further discussion? Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| Mr. Law Director, I need to ask a question for clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| We were talking about many different things during this Board of Zonings appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| and one of the issues that I think we just kind of skirted over a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6566)|
| 1:49:30| was the technical part of the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| or the technical part that we have to go through the engineers on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| Now, what are we addressing in here is having the technical part of the design plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6578)|
| 1:49:49| that of the development, going to the professionals to decide if it meets within the context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6589)|
| 1:49:57| of being properly engineered. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| That's correct, and that's what happens now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| It goes to the Planning Commission, Planning Commission staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| and various other actors, including Engineering and Public Works and others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| to determine whether or not the development plan meets with the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| of the Knox County Zoning Regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| And then it goes before the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| which is a body that's appointed by this body and the City Council for their vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| If we're talking about a subdivision plan, a concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| under the subdivision rules and regulations, those go straight to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| And the development portion of it is probably more technical, as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| than even the concept plan in terms of whether or not it meets those specific requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| So what this would do is have all of those appeals from, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| a subdivision that's being developed, go one place rather than shooting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6651)|
| 1:50:55| in two or three different directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Thank you. Mr. Snowden, let me ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| There's three different kinds of stamps you can have on this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| You can have an engineer, a surveyor, or an architect, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6666)|
| 1:51:11| I'd like Amy to clarify, but I think on a development plan it says an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6671)|
| 1:51:17| or an engineer, but I think a surveyor can do a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6677)|
| 1:51:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| So you have to have those professional engineers to have the process in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6686)|
| 1:51:32| And who reviews those processes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6692)|
| 1:51:38| My understanding is the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| I think the staff makes a recommendation to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| The Planning Commission looks to make sure that it meets all the requirements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6706)|
| 1:51:51| Thank you. Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| I think Mr. Bussler sort of addressed part of Commissioner Skidmaker's comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6717)|
| 1:52:05| was go back to that case I watched that you said it was resolved with 65 to 68 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6725)|
| 1:52:14| I think the point is it shouldn't have ever been appealable in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| It went through all the proper steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| During Planning Commission they said everything meets the rules and regs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| but there's some question about whether this is a stream or a washout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6748)|
| 1:52:34| So one of the conditions of we're going to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| but you've got to go get a hydrologist to determine that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| So things were moving along, and the Planning Commission, the appointed body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| said go hire an expert and just double check that this is not a stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| which would be a different way to buffer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| The developer did do that, produced the report, and said it's not a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| The hydrologist said it's not a stream, it's a washout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| And according to the grading plan, we have a way to address it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6783)|
| 1:53:07| we have a way to route the water, we have a retention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| we have storm water issues, and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| And so that should have sufficed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| But a citizen said, no, I believe it's still a stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| filed an appeal, and held up that process for 65 to 68 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6799)|
| 1:53:26| So I think that proves, that sort of exacerbates the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| It shouldn't even have been an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6811)|
| 1:53:33| It was a development plan that asked to have something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6813)|
| 1:53:37| The developer did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| A licensed engineer did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6818)|
| 1:53:39| It was a technical nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| Move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| But instead, in those 65 to 68 days, anything could have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6822)|
| 1:53:47| The property owner could have said, I don't want to sell anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| and that would have fallen apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| This is kind of the point, is the average, sort of the everyday citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| should be able to have a voice in many different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| But when we go through the process legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| and then the appointed board, the planning commission says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| go do this one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| I mean, we just did a whole meeting about beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| We issued a beer permit, and we said, upon condition of a CO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| of a health department check, we're going to go ahead and approve you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| And as long as you produce those, you get your beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| you start selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| We didn't give an opportunity to appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| I don't think you should sell beer at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| We gave them the, you know, here's the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| So I think it absolutely shows that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| why some things should be appealable and why some things shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6879)|
| 1:54:42| Mr. Thompson, did you want to respond to something about that particular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| Yes, since I was on the BZA on the case that Mr. Jay is referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6887)|
| 1:54:52| I would like to respond to that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| As far as the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6896)|
| 1:54:58| Speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| Speak up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| The BZA did not attempt to undertake any engineering determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| What happened at Planning Commission was Planning Commission imposed nine conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6909)|
| 1:55:16| on their approval, and this was at the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| The conditions were on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| One of those conditions was that the developer would obtain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| would provide a proper certification that the stream was not a bleed line stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| and that's a fairly standard – it's a fairly standard process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| and the developer, Mr. Davis, knew that process well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| He understands that he could not do any work until he had that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6939)|
| 1:55:44| The determination has to go through TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| It is not a private determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| The developer can hire a private engineer to look at the waterway and make their opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6950)|
| 1:55:56| but it has to be confirmed by TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| So when the appeal came to BZA, the appeal was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| well, we think it should be determined whether it's a bleed line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| They did not say we know it is a bleed line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| They said we want that determination to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6970)|
| 1:56:14| And Mr. Davis agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| The parties all agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| Let's go ahead and get the determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| It was that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| Mr. Davis was quite confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| He said, well, I've done enough of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| I know that's not a bleed line stream, but I know I have to go to TDEC before I can do any work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| So he agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| That was in the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| And BZA said, well, see if you can get that determination from TDEC by October, which he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=6996)|
| 1:56:43| And TDEC confirmed he was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7003)|
| 1:56:45| It's not a bleed line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7005)|
| 1:56:46| And that allowed him to go ahead with his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| But as Mr. Schoonmaker pointed out, he did not immediately jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| Several months went by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| The property, nothing happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| So first of all, Mr. Davis knows his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7016)|
| 1:57:02| He knew it was not a bleed line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| He was very confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| I don't think that in the period between September and October, I don't think he sat there thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| well, gosh, I better not do anything because I might get shot down in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7030)|
| 1:57:16| I think he knew his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7036)|
| 1:57:17| He was quite confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7037)|
| 1:57:18| He said he was confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7038)|
| 1:57:20| He said, I've been in this business 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| I've done more of these than anybody in Knox County except for EP&W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7041)|
| 1:57:27| So I don't think that held up his process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| He still has ‑‑ it was still eight months before he did anything, before he applied for a grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| before he got grading done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| And related to that, so BZA did not try to do the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| But with all due respect, BZA actually on the first vote turned it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7062)|
| 1:57:48| not because he had actually fulfilled the duties of asked, but because of an opinion of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7068)|
| 1:57:55| I watched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| The members of the BZA basically denied, I mean, was going to stop the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7076)|
| 1:58:03| because they felt their opinion was and they felt that flooding would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| Even though everyone on the engineering staff said it's not going to be more flooded than any other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| So it's a perfect example of how they voted based upon emotion, not based upon a technical requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7094)|
| 1:58:23| And then only because you said, come on, we've got to do something here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7103)|
| 1:58:27| did you say, well, can we sit down and kind of go over your TDEC plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7107)|
| 1:58:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7113)|
| 1:58:35| Well, I'm sorry, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7115)|
| 1:58:39| This is getting very technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| But since it's come up, the other ‑‑ the actual flaw at the planning commission was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7122)|
| 1:58:51| the subdivision rules require that before a concept plan can be submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| it must include a preliminary stormwater study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| And that preliminary study is supposed to be part of the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| which is submitted to planning commission, which is available to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| which the public has the opportunity to review and comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| That did not happen in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| That was a flaw in the process at the planning commission stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| They did not have the stormwater plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| Therefore, the citizens did not have anything to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| But they knew there was flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| They had photos of the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| So the resolution we had, which to me is the perfect resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7170)|
| 1:59:34| we could have said we uphold the appeal because of that flaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| But what we said was all we want is for citizens to have the opportunity to review a stormwater plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| which is what should have happened in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| BZA approved Mr. Davis' plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| If you will ‑‑ we said we'll approve you if you'll have that discussion with the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| If you'll show them the plan, let them comment on it like they could have if it had been a planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| Now, the lead plaintiff in that appeal was Mr. James Gentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7203)|
| 2:00:11| He was the one that signed the appeal to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| I spoke with him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| He had just gotten out of the hospital from COVID, but I asked him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| did Mr. Davis offer you that opportunity as he agreed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7220)|
| 2:00:24| And Mr. Gentry said, no, I never had that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| So I say that for what it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| The other thing you've raised, Mr. J, which we went through this last month, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| You're implying that development plan applications are highly technical engineering matters which require technical expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7237)|
| 2:00:46| I thought we had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| Planning commissioners do not have engineering degrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| Planning commissioners vote on development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7252)|
| 2:00:56| BZA, members of BZA are just equally situated to planning commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7256)|
| 2:01:02| They are citizens from various professions, various walks of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| They have the opportunity to consult EP&W.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| They have the opportunity to consult professional planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| BZA does call on EP&W in appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| I don't see how you can say BZA members are not qualified, whereas planning commissioners are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7277)|
| 2:01:23| That makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7284)|
| 2:01:32| Mr. Thompson, I am so sorry, but I have to limit the remainder of the debate to the commissioners tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| There's been ample opportunity for public forum, and this is not our protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7298)|
| 2:01:44| Commissioner Smith, the other floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| I call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| I have a call for the question by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| Madam Clerk, please call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7316)|
| 2:02:00| Is this the vote to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| This is the vote to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7327)|
| 2:02:09| Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7329)|

| 2:02:13| Commissioner BHELOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7333)|
| 2:02:15| Commissioner DAOEY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7335)|
| 2:02:16| Commissioner JAY.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| Commissioner Biggs is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7339)|
| 2:02:20| Commissioner Lunde.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7340)|
| 2:02:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7341)|
| 2:02:22| Commissioner DURRETT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7342)|
| 2:02:23| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| Mr. Smith, I sense the chairman does not wish to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7347)|
| 2:02:48| Is there anything that you would rather like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| I can make a substitute motion that we open the floor back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| There is things I'd like to add, that's why I told Mr. Thompson that there were some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| that I wanted to limit the debate to the commissioners, and as chair I'd normally wait until everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7383)|
| 2:03:08| else has had a chance to speak, and I really did want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| Okay, well I make a motion that we open it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7394)|
| 2:03:15| I do not want to cut you off, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7395)|
| 2:03:18| Thank you, Mr. Smith, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7398)|
| 2:03:25| We can do a voice vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| We have a motion to open the debate back up, and that is seconded by, who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7406)|
| 2:03:32| It was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7412)|
| 2:03:33| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| I believe Daly seconded it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| You seconded the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7422)|
| 2:03:43| Okay, Commissioner Daly is the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| All in favor of opening debate, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| Okay, debate is back open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| Is there anyone, any other commissioners who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7432)|
| 2:03:56| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| Just briefly, the idea of whether who is qualified or not qualified, certainly once we get outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7439)|
| 2:04:09| of the realm of the Mr. Snowdens of the world, the licensed folks that can in fact speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7449)|
| 2:04:18| intelligently to this more so than probably he's there, a planning commissioner, or anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7458)|
| 2:04:26| In the end, the result can still end up in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7466)|
| 2:04:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| Then, we've not accomplished really anything in that as a judge probably has no more expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7475)|
| 2:04:49| in engineering than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7489)|
| 2:04:52| I mean, I'm just stating, at some point in time, we have to stop and trust someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7492)|
| 2:04:57| If I could clarify that with the help of the law director, the judge would not be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7497)|
| 2:05:05| at the engineering decisions, he would be looking at the process and the function for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| its legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| In an appeal of this nature, what you're talking about is what's called a writ of certiorari.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| What the court looks at is to see whether or not there was material evidence to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| the action that the planning commission took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7522)|
| 2:05:24| So the judge doesn't reweigh the evidence, the judge doesn't determine whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| the hydrologist in this particular case was correct or incorrect, the judge just simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| looks at whether or not the planning commission had evidence before it from which it could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7533)|
| 2:05:38| have reasonably made the decision that it made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| So that's not a technical, it's more just a review of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| Thank you, Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7547)|
| 2:05:52| I do apologize for wearing my emotions a little bit too much on my face, I just wasn't expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| that to happen quite that fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| So I have heard from a lot of people on this, I've heard from a lot of you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7565)|
| 2:06:16| And I have listened, I have not just heard, I have listened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7576)|
| 2:06:20| And I've probably heard you in my sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7580)|
| 2:06:24| But I have wrestled all weekend with this reality, and that is that you're not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7584)|
| 2:06:32| to get what you want tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| And this is the reason, and I want to go off what Commissioner Jay said at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7594)|
| 2:06:39| Regardless of the differences in legal opinions, our attorney, who happens to be a former chancellor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7599)|
| 2:06:49| has taken the position that under the current ordinance, development plan appeals should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7609)|
| 2:06:57| not be going to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| Am I correct in that, Mr. Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| Therefore, if this ordinance amendment fails, everything is going to court in terms of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7622)|
| 2:07:13| plan appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| That would be the county's position through its attorney, is that all development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| appeals are going to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| I know you don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7641)|
| 2:07:23| If this ordinance passes, BZA is in the mix, but I know it's not in the mix the way you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7643)|
| 2:07:29| want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7649)|
| 2:07:31| My point is, regardless of what this commission does tonight, it's going to require further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7651)|
| 2:07:37| legislative action of a new commission in order for you to get what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7657)|
| 2:07:43| There's a new one going to be seated in 10 days, and I'll be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7663)|
| 2:07:49| So I thought about this as kind of a punt, pass, or kick situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7669)|
| 2:07:57| We can pass this, and everything is going to go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7677)|
| 2:08:03| Or we can kick it, kick it out, vote it down, excuse me, pass it, and it's BZA is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7683)|
| 2:08:10| mix, but it's not the way you want it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7690)|
| 2:08:12| We can kick it out, and everything goes to court, or we can punt it down the road for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7692)|
| 2:08:18| the next commission to decide on, and we've already voted not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| I say this because several of you have emailed me, Mr. Anders even said in his comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7704)|
| 2:08:30| that what you would like for us to do is amend this ordinance to codify that appeals do go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7710)|
| 2:08:36| to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| This commission can't do that, because that would have to go through two readings, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| this commission won't be hearing the next reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| That to me would not be good legislative policy, to vote on first reading one way and second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| reading another commission, another commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| So yeah, that's kind of where we stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| We have a new commission seated in ten days, and regardless of how this vote goes, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| sure you guys will be lobbying that commission for what you are seeking, because it probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| won't happen from either way this goes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| So that's what I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220822-zoning?start=7750)|
