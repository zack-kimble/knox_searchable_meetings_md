| 2:16:30| by closing it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| as far as property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8193)|
| 2:16:37| We have, whatever you do tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8197)|
| 2:16:39| we have a normal due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| that will have to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| that will cost us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| a little more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| if you act on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| There's a normal application procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8210)|
| 2:16:52| that we have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8212)|
| 2:16:53| We have to get waivers of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| that are adjacent to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| There is a constitutional right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| these people have to that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| So there's a lot of legal issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| we will have to address in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8224)|
| 2:17:06| It's not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8226)|
| 2:17:07| just an overnight thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| And I don't believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| any of the due process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| has really started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| I think it's probably here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| a little bit premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| But anyway, it's a good thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8237)|
| 2:17:19| to have this debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| and to let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8240)|
| 2:17:21| whether we need to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8241)|
| 2:17:22| or not start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| whatever the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| But yes, they do have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| there are some constitutional rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| at stake, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8248)|
| 2:17:36| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8256)|
| 2:17:37| Yeah, I'll defer to Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8257)|
| 2:17:48| There's one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8268)|
| 2:17:49| I wanted to clear up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8269)|
| 2:17:50| from last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| before Dwight can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| You did talk to Chief Harness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| of Rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| and he had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8277)|
| 2:17:58| he sees no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| entering and exiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| off Twin Creek at John Spear Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| and closure of the north section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| I did, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8285)|
| 2:18:06| I've got an email from Chief Harness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8286)|
| 2:18:08| in which he indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| that he didn't see any problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8289)|
| 2:18:10| with the route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8290)|
| 2:18:11| as far as emergency response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8291)|
| 2:18:13| And he was favorably disposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| to the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8296)|
| 2:18:17| because it, in his mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8297)|
| 2:18:18| reduced the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8298)|
| 2:18:19| of any kind of fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| that was associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8301)|
| 2:18:22| with the dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8302)|
| 2:18:24| I think you've been in contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8304)|
| 2:18:25| with the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| so I'm going to defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8306)|
| 2:18:28| Do we want to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| for 60 days or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| We're certainly comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| with a deferral for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8313)|
| 2:18:35| I know Mr. Chairman Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| had asked me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8316)|
| 2:18:37| if we would start the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8317)|
| 2:18:38| of getting an estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8318)|
| 2:18:39| for the cleanup of the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| And he had mentioned 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| and I had asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8323)|
| 2:18:44| if he would be so gracious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8324)|
| 2:18:46| to consider 60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8326)|
| 2:18:47| to give us a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8327)|
| 2:18:49| to obtain the pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| The law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8331)|
| 2:18:52| has volunteered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8332)|
| 2:18:53| to produce affidavits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| We have notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| the affected property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| by certified mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| And remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| these are folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| that are contiguous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| to the area of closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| It isn't the mere fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| of living on Twin Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| doesn't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| this particular standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| that Mr. Armstrong's referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| but it is those property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| that abut the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| They've all been notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| by certified mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8353)|
| 2:19:14| and have all indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| they are in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| But if we need to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| those affidavits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8357)|
| 2:19:18| from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| certainly we could do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| in the next 60 days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| So we don't have an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| with a 60-day deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| if that's the will of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8365)|
| 2:19:27| I have no issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8367)|
| 2:19:28| with the 60 days either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8368)|
| 2:19:29| That way we'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| a better estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| on maybe the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| that will take...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| It's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| an astronomical number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| for the estimate of the cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8379)|
| 2:19:40| So I would make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8380)|
| 2:19:42| to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8388)|
| 2:19:51| Would you clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8391)|
| 2:19:52| what the motion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8392)|
| 2:19:53| that we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8393)|
| 2:19:54| The motion is to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8394)|
| 2:19:56| for 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8396)|
| 2:19:57| the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8397)|
| 2:19:58| for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8398)|
| 2:20:01| Put us in the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8401)|
| 2:20:07| Seeing no further lights on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8411)|

| 2:20:14| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8414)|

| 2:20:26| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8426)|
| 2:20:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8428)|
| 2:20:29| With a proper motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=8429)|

| 2:33:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9238)|
| 2:33:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| I spoke with Jim Wright, Jr. today, also noticed that he's got the support of Roy Cruz, a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| of folks who have given a lot to this particular committee and have got a lot of respect within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9246)|
| 2:34:11| the law enforcement community, that they're advocates for law enforcement, yet they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| realize that a big part of this committee is being an objective person to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| that everybody's treated equally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9260)|
| 2:34:23| So frankly, if Mr. Schott has got the support of Jim Wright, Jr., he's going to have my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9263)|
| 2:34:28| support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9268)|
| 2:34:30| And Jim came on to that committee as an alternate, I think we voted him in as a permanent within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9270)|
| 2:34:35| the last year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9275)|
| 2:34:37| So I just want to let you know my thoughts on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9277)|
| 2:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9281)|
| 2:34:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| I worked with Bill Schott for more than 10 years at Carter High School, and he's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9283)|
| 2:34:48| outstanding man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9288)|
| 2:34:50| He was the shop teacher there, and his level of professionalism and experience with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9290)|
| 2:34:57| Sheriff Department as well as a former educator would be valuable for the alternate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9297)|
| 2:35:05| But I want to echo what Commissioner Brantley said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9305)|
| 2:35:09| I think we need to look at our policies and procedures about the number of people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9309)|
| 2:35:14| are on multiple boards versus extending applicants out so that we can have a larger pool of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9314)|
| 2:35:23| to draw from, because what we will end up with is a filter from a single individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9323)|
| 2:35:32| and not the greater scope of what the county represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9335)|
| 2:35:36| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9336)|
| 2:35:37| Yeah, I think the way that they advertise these available positions is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9337)|
| 2:35:40| needs to be tweaked into the modern world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9340)|
| 2:35:43| I believe they come out in the classified sections of the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9343)|
| 2:35:47| Which lends to our policies and procedures as commission that we need to take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9347)|
| 2:35:51| at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9351)|
| 2:35:53| Commissioner Neisner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9353)|
| 2:35:55| One follow-up on what Ms. Gill had mentioned on this is with the Sheriff's Merit Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9355)|
| 2:36:02| the way this works, like Ms. Ulster was an alternate member, and with the rotation, she's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9362)|
| 2:36:08| coming from being an alternate to being a member of the committee, whereas you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| at some of our other committees and boards that we appoint to, we don't always have alternates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9371)|
| 2:36:16| Which might be a way to try and build a bigger bench, so that's something we can look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9376)|
| 2:36:21| for the future, is it may make some sense for some of these committees to build in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9381)|
| 2:36:27| alternates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9387)|
| 2:36:28| Now granted, we still have in everything we do, shallow pools of folks to apply, so there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9388)|
| 2:36:33| a social media, I'm not sure what it'll do, but we do need to deepen the pool, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9393)|
| 2:36:39| Commissioner Brantley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| I would suggest, this is not a motion, but it's just something to think about, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| limit the number of committees that a person can serve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9405)|
| 2:36:49| We as commissioners are limited on the number of committees we can serve on, in a way, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9409)|
| 2:36:54| we're appointed to them, so it just makes sense to do that, and if you're at your limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9414)|
| 2:37:00| then we're going to find somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| I think if we can find a way to get the word out there and encourage people to volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9422)|
| 2:37:08| it may be a problem that can solve itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9431)|
| 2:37:13| So, are we considering Gina for three committees here, or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9433)|
| 2:37:19| Just two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| Two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| She's already a member of the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9446)|
| 2:37:27| But we'll do 28 first, and then we'll address 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9447)|
| 2:37:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| Can you make a motion to withdraw her name from the nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9452)|
| 2:37:36| Or is that all or none?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9456)|
| 2:37:39| I was just going to say, on number 29, why don't we just defer it for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| We don't have any representative from the Property Assessor's Office here where we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9463)|
| 2:37:47| find out what the alternate is, so we'll give the Property Assessor a chance to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9467)|
| 2:37:58| That would be just for 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9478)|
| 2:38:00| Stick to 28, one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9480)|
| 2:38:02| We're on 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9482)|
| 2:38:03| 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9483)|
| 2:38:04| Yeah, 29 is a paying committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9484)|
| 2:38:07| It's a paying appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9487)|
| 2:38:09| You get paid per day that you work on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9489)|
| 2:38:13| Commissioner Meister?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| I'll just say one point of reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| I think we already voted to appoint Gina as an alternate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9496)|
| 2:38:21| I can't remember for merit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| Maybe it was six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9503)|
| 2:38:24| I remember, yeah, maybe it was about six months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| That is a vote that we've already taken on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| I can't speak to the other one on 29, but I just do recall her coming up as a vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9510)|
| 2:38:35| 28, which we did vote to approve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9515)|
| 2:38:40| These are very different positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9520)|
| 2:38:45| Okay, we're back to 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| Do I have a motion to add Mr. Schott's name to the blank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9528)|
| 2:38:55| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9535)|
| 2:38:56| In a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9537)|
| 2:38:59| Okay, so the motion is before us to add Mr. Schott's name to the blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9539)|
| 2:39:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9544)|
| 2:39:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9545)|
| 2:39:06| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| Madam Clerk, next item please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9550)|
| 2:39:12| Do you need to vote on the resolution now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9552)|
| 2:39:14| I move that we approve the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9557)|
| 2:39:18| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9558)|
| 2:39:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9559)|
| 2:39:20| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9560)|
| 2:39:24| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9564)|
| 2:39:27| Resolution 113 is reappointing William Keeler and appointing James Beck and Gene Lawson as members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9567)|
| 2:39:34| and reappointing Jerome Solomon and Gina Oster as alternates on the Knox County Board of Equalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9574)|
| 2:39:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| Again, because we don't have someone here from the Property Assessor's Office to give us some more details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9589)|
| 2:39:54| why don't we just defer this for 30 days and find out what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9594)|
| 2:39:59| You know, I think we do all appreciate somebody volunteering their time to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9599)|
| 2:40:04| but Commissioner Brantley does make a very good point that one individual should not serve on every committee for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9604)|
| 2:40:14| So I guess I'll make a motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| The motion is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9621)|
| 2:40:23| We have a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9623)|
| 2:40:24| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9624)|
| 2:40:31| Since we do not have anyone here from the office to give us guidance, do they need members to the board now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9631)|
| 2:40:44| Should we split this into two and have the appointing of James Beck and Gene Lawson and defer the alternates for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9644)|
| 2:40:58| Do you see my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9658)|
| 2:41:02| Again, if we had somebody here, but I don't think the Board of Equalization meets until, what is it, June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| Do they have training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9667)|
| 2:41:10| Yeah, but that mandatory training is not until after July 1st of this year with the new bill that goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9670)|
| 2:41:17| And we haven't seen the resumes of those two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9677)|
| 2:41:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9680)|
| 2:41:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9681)|
| 2:41:22| So again, when we have something on the agenda by a department, we need to have somebody here to help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9682)|
| 2:41:28| And I just offer that as a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| I'm agreeable with the motion that's on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9690)|
| 2:41:35| In fairness to the department head, this was on consent for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| It was pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9699)|
| 2:41:43| Okay, so the motion is to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9703)|
| 2:41:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9707)|
| 2:41:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9708)|
| 2:41:49| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9709)|
| 2:41:50| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9710)|
| 2:41:51| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| Resolution 701 is approving a contract with GrassWorks Landscape and LLC for mowing services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9717)|
| 2:42:06| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9732)|
| 2:42:14| Anybody from Rec Area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9734)|
| 2:42:24| I think he explained this once, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9744)|
| 2:42:28| No, he wasn't here last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| Oh, there he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9750)|
| 2:42:31| Hey, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9751)|
| 2:42:32| This department head is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9752)|
| 2:42:33| Come out and lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| Doug Battelle, Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| And this was just moving to an alternative bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| We had some issues with one vendor, so we're moving to the next one that was on the bid list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9769)|
| 2:42:51| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9771)|
| 2:42:52| Question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9772)|
| 2:42:53| I've gone over those bid lists that were originally put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9773)|
| 2:42:58| and there was a point system that went through there about the number of how they were qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9778)|
| 2:43:05| Was this the second place vote that's getting it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9785)|
| 2:43:11| I believe it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9791)|
| 2:43:13| Purchasing is here, too, because they're obviously always involved in these processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9793)|
| 2:43:16| especially when an issue like this comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| They were probably third because we had two that we selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9799)|
| 2:43:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9802)|
| 2:43:23| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement, 1000 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| Commissioner, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9806)|
| 2:43:28| The first provider that we brought to you several months ago has not been performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9808)|
| 2:43:33| We terminated that contract, and this is the second low bidder in that category in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9813)|
| 2:43:38| We break these up by zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| So we're coming with the next second one for the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9821)|
| 2:43:45| Now, the one that had it before, weren't they in two different zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| The original winner of the contract, aren't they performing in two different zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9830)|
| 2:43:56| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9836)|
| 2:43:57| We terminated their entire contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| They had been getting calls that the parks were not being cut, looking good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9840)|
| 2:44:05| so we terminated that contract, and this is the second low bidder in those zones for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9845)|
| 2:44:11| Didn't we have some people that were in some of those other zones that had performed before this was let performing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9851)|
| 2:44:19| I mean, they were doing the job well, but you bid so you only had one to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| I think that was one of the things, wasn't it, where you gave more emphasis to the number of equipment that this one that won it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9864)|
| 2:44:34| What I'm trying to say is there was other bidders out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| and they had been performing this service for us before, but they didn't make the cut this last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9877)|
| 2:44:45| and were they not considered because they had done business with us before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| since this one that you awarded the contract didn't perform well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9889)|
| 2:44:55| The first time we came to you a month or two ago were the top bidders in their zones, the top point bidders in their zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9895)|
| 2:45:04| This is the company that we terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| The one that you have before you now is the second top in the zones that we brought to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9913)|
| 2:45:20| We have Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9920)|
| 2:45:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9922)|
| 2:45:23| Do we have additional safeguards in place if this contractor doesn't meet the obligations that we set forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9923)|
| 2:45:30| so we won't be back here again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9930)|
| 2:45:32| As we did with the contractor that we terminated, we brought them in and talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9932)|
| 2:45:37| We wanted to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| We wanted them to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| We wanted to keep that contract going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9939)|
| 2:45:41| We tried, gave them another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9941)|
| 2:45:43| They weren't performing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| If by chance another vendor was to meet the same fate, and we hope not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| then we would go to the next highest point getting vendor in those zones and ask them if they can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9950)|
| 2:45:59| The bad thing is this time of year people are booked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9959)|
| 2:46:02| They have all the grass they can cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| So we're hoping everything goes well and these perform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| And we will stay on top of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9968)|
| 2:46:12| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9972)|
| 2:46:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9974)|
| 2:46:15| For the record, this is the east zone, Forks of the River, Mascot, and East Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9975)|
| 2:46:20| and then also Carter Park in the north zone is where this contractor was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9980)|
| 2:46:25| So it's for the east and north zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| So the south and the west must be doing a pretty good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| That's the reason I asked the question, because it is the eastern portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| that I guess you just had long-term concerns and we're now addressing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=9996)|
| 2:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10004)|
| 2:46:45| We have a motion, a proper motion, and a second before us to approve the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10009)|

| 2:47:19| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10040)|
| 2:47:23| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| Seeing no lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10050)|
| 2:47:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10051)|
| 2:47:32| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10052)|
| 2:47:34| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10054)|
| 2:47:35| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10055)|
| 2:47:36| Item 50, presentation of the Knox County Parks and Recreation Annual Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10056)|
| 2:47:50| The report was handed out last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| so I've just got a couple quick bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| I know you're running late anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10073)|
| 2:47:54| so I won't take but a minute and answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10074)|
| 2:47:57| Just some highlights from the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10077)|
| 2:47:58| We work with over 50 partner organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| and that includes 33 sports and recreation nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10081)|
| 2:48:04| that operate in numerous community parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10084)|
| 2:48:07| I want to recognize the list there of the citizen members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10087)|
| 2:48:09| that serve on both our Park Advisory Board as well as the Three Ridges Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10089)|
| 2:48:13| And then just some key points on user information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10093)|
| 2:48:16| We're proud to have over 42,000 sports participants in a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10096)|
| 2:48:20| $10.2 million in tournament economic impact at county parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10100)|
| 2:48:24| primarily in our three big sports parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10104)|
| 2:48:26| and over 3,000 volunteers helping us every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10106)|
| 2:48:29| So we've got a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10109)|
| 2:48:30| And I also want to thank Mike Danila from our staff for compiling the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10110)|
| 2:48:34| and Dan Proctor from the Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10114)|

| 2:48:50| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10130)|
| 2:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10131)|
| 2:48:55| Don't you run away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| I just want to say I serve on the Parks and Rec Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| and I'm really impressed with all the people that own the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| and the way Doug handles all that, and the crew that works for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10145)|
| 2:49:11| It's an impressive group, and I appreciate everything you all do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10151)|
| 2:49:14| because you have your hands full with all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10154)|
| 2:49:18| The games you oversee all year long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10158)|
| 2:49:21| and then all the different things we're asking you to do as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10161)|
| 2:49:24| Plum Creek, the many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| Clayton Park looks fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10167)|
| 2:49:29| So I just didn't want you to walk away without us saying thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10169)|
| 2:49:32| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| I appreciate that and certainly pass it along to our staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10173)|
| 2:49:35| we're real proud of, and certainly our volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10175)|
| 2:49:37| Without the thousands of volunteers we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10177)|
| 2:49:39| we would literally not have a recreation program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10179)|
| 2:49:42| So hats off to all those Little League coaches, trail builders, you name it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10182)|
| 2:49:46| we've got it, and they come out and really help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10186)|
| 2:49:51| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10191)|
| 2:49:53| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10193)|
| 2:49:55| Item 51, discussion item regarding the Tennessee County Services Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10195)|
| 2:50:00| TCSA 2018 County Government Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| Can you guys go through this in about three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10209)|
| 2:50:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10210)|
| 2:50:12| Well, the annual County Government Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| that's a conference that's held in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| with the County Officials Association of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| and it represents all the elected and appointed court clerks, trustees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| county clerks, and registered deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10225)|
| 2:50:27| And it's a great opportunity for us to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10227)|
| 2:50:31| and actually be in the general session assembly there with our senators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10231)|
| 2:50:37| and our house people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10237)|
| 2:50:40| It was held back in Nashville, March the 12th and 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10240)|
| 2:50:44| and there were several of us that went down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10244)|
| 2:50:47| and some that came down for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10247)|
| 2:50:50| And it's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10250)|
| 2:50:52| Knox County Commission up here has really gotten involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10252)|
| 2:50:55| with what's happening in the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10255)|
| 2:50:57| along with our Dwight Van DeVate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| who is over the official highways of the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10260)|
| 2:51:05| which is a big honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10265)|
| 2:51:07| We have stayed up because all these counties look to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10267)|
| 2:51:12| as being one of the big counties and having their act together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10272)|
| 2:51:17| So we want to make sure that we represent Knox County well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| So I'm going to just leave it open for any of you that did attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| if there's something you want to add to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10287)|
| 2:51:30| Commissioner Gill, Schoonmaker, and did you come down too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| And Commissioner Bussler, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10294)|
| 2:51:38| and I believe Commissioner Anders came down for a day also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10298)|
| 2:51:41| So it's a great way to stay informed to find out what's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10301)|
| 2:51:45| And we're making a difference in what our legislators are taking to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10305)|
| 2:51:51| and making Knox County a better county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10311)|
| 2:51:54| as well as all the counties in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10314)|
| 2:51:57| So I'll open the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| Thank you, Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| I just want to say we echo the statements you've made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10322)|
| 2:52:05| and we're going to be hosting within the next year, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10325)|
| 2:52:10| So we look forward to making sure all of you will be assigned committee work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10330)|
| 2:52:16| to welcome our fellow commissioners and delegates from across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10336)|
| 2:52:22| And I simply want to say good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10342)|
| 2:52:27| I just want to say that it was a good opportunity for myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10347)|
| 2:52:30| to meet Representative Lamberth, who's in charge of the Judiciary Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10350)|
| 2:52:34| You all know my platform is litter, litter, litter, litter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10354)|
| 2:52:37| and hopefully we will get some good news here in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10357)|
| 2:52:42| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10362)|
| 2:52:43| And again, I think it's a great opportunity for us to interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10363)|
| 2:52:46| with some of our colleagues around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10366)|
| 2:52:49| And interesting just to hear how some of the smaller counties handle things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10369)|
| 2:52:54| One of our neighbors to the west, Roan County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| is actually going through a situation where they're going to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| the number of their high schools in Roan County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10380)|
| 2:53:03| which is very interesting on how they're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10383)|
| 2:53:06| And Washington County is trying to emulate what Knox County did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10386)|
| 2:53:11| by moving from about a 25 commissioner base down to 15 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10391)|
| 2:53:17| So it's kind of, you know, they specifically ask how is that working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10397)|
| 2:53:23| with 11 members handling all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10403)|
| 2:53:26| and of course the response was it's working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10406)|
| 2:53:30| But I think it's just a great opportunity to learn from some of our colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10410)|
| 2:53:37| I think one of the biggest things that I've learned down there is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10417)|
| 2:53:41| we even voted on a self-education program for new commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10421)|
| 2:53:45| that will be coming in, and that's where the TCSA will come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10425)|
| 2:53:49| And also we had some legislation that went down there that if we could handle that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10429)|
| 2:53:56| we'll be going in November, I guess, to review bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10436)|
| 2:53:58| It will be coming up for the next session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10438)|
| 2:54:01| We can bring some of the things that we're considering to go before the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10441)|
| 2:54:06| We could go down there and discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| and get some traction behind some of the things we want to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10448)|
| 2:54:12| So it does give us an end with the state governmental actions that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10452)|
| 2:54:18| So I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| Item 52, discussion item regarding budget meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10464)|
| 2:54:29| Okay, I've been working on this, and it's been a little difficult with everybody's schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10469)|
| 2:54:35| and I know that one of these days we're going to have two people that can't be at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10475)|
| 2:54:42| But what I have set up right now, the mayor is presenting his budget to us on May 7th at 9 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10482)|
| 2:54:49| here in the main assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10489)|
| 2:54:52| I am calling for a May 24th public hearing at 5 p.m. here in the main assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10492)|
| 2:55:01| and I know that Mr. Schoonmaker, Commissioner Schoonmaker, will not be able to attend that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10501)|
| 2:55:08| and Michelle, you will not, Commissioner Carringer will not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| But I can't find another date that I can fit that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10512)|
| 2:55:16| and still get to a workshop on the budget and a special call meeting for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10516)|
| 2:55:23| So looking at these dates and times, May 24th, 5 p.m., May 30th, 2 p.m., and June 12th at 3 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10523)|
| 2:55:33| is that okay with everybody's schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10533)|
| 2:55:36| June 12th, 3 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10536)|
| 2:55:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10537)|
| 2:55:38| June 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10538)|
| 2:55:39| June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10539)|
| 2:55:40| June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| I know, it's your anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| It's your anniversary, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10545)|
| 2:55:46| You all aren't married to each other, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10548)|
| 2:55:49| What was the last date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10549)|
| 2:55:50| June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10550)|
| 2:55:55| I think I'll be in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| I'll be in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| You'll be in town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10558)|
| 2:55:59| I'll be in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10559)|
| 2:56:00| Were you able to find out, Evelyn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10562)|
| 2:56:05| You were going to Harvard, weren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10565)|
| 2:56:10| Mr. Chair, would you go down your list one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10570)|
| 2:56:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10573)|
| 2:56:14| May 24th at 5 p.m. for a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10574)|
| 2:56:19| May 30th at 2 p.m. for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10579)|
| 2:56:23| June 12th at 3 p.m. for a special call meeting for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10583)|
| 2:56:35| And I think someone was going to be out of town until about the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10595)|
| 2:56:41| Was that you, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10601)|
| 2:56:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10603)|
| 2:56:45| No, that was Commissioner Daly was having knee surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10605)|
| 2:56:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| I'm going to go down to the P.D.I. to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10612)|
| 2:56:55| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10615)|
| 2:57:04| We don't know how long that meeting will last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10624)|
| 2:57:08| The voting meeting is the biggie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| Yeah, that's the biggie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10631)|
| 2:57:13| That's June 12th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10633)|
| 2:57:21| Commissioner Anders, will June 12th work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10641)|
| 2:57:26| He's asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10647)|
| 2:57:30| Evelyn, when do you think you'll be able to know by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10650)|
| 2:57:33| I know the trip already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10655)|
| 2:57:36| We'll discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10658)|
| 2:57:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| I mean, I don't know if you have to Skype me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| I don't think we can actually do that on a voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| We can't vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10667)|
| 2:57:48| Yeah, vote by Skype.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10668)|
| 2:57:50| You've got to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10670)|
| 2:57:52| You could do a workshop, but not an actual voting meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10672)|
| 2:57:57| Is that when it's going to be, June 12th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10677)|
| 2:57:59| Yeah, that's what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| What time, early in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10681)|
| 2:58:02| Nope, 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| Can we put it down there as a definite?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| Commissioner Skidmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| When we get through those, can I mention what the finance committee date for working with the school finance team?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10692)|
| 2:58:20| Did you actually find something that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10700)|
| 2:58:22| We'll know in about two seconds when we announce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10702)|
| 2:58:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| If you could, please, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| He's going to speak of the school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10710)|
| 2:58:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10712)|
| 2:58:34| If you all could, email Drew and let me know if those will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10714)|
| 2:58:40| and also give me the dates that will not work so that I can try to keep moving this around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10720)|
| 2:58:47| until I find something that gets as many of us at these meetings as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10727)|
| 2:58:51| I'm trying really hard, but a lot of you guys have schedules that are overlapping with days that don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10731)|
| 2:58:58| Commissioner Skidmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10740)|
| 2:59:01| The finance team is trying to work with Knox County Schools to get a date where their team can sit down with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10741)|
| 2:59:07| and go over their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| We'll know for sure in the morning, but right now it looks like can everybody attend May 3rd at 3 p.m.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10749)|
| 2:59:18| Say 3 to 5, roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| What day was that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10760)|
| 2:59:21| May 3rd, Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10761)|
| 2:59:28| We were trying to get it in before the mayor's presentation on the 7th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10768)|
| 2:59:34| May 3rd at 3 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10774)|
| 2:59:44| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10784)|
| 2:59:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10785)|
| 2:59:46| Commissioner Skidmaker, the purpose of the meeting that you're trying to schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10786)|
| 2:59:54| Yes, the finance committee was tasked with the responsibility of working with the school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10794)|
| 3:00:02| to be able to have a meeting where all commissioners could hear from the finance team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10802)|
| 3:00:07| and the administration of Knox County Schools regarding their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10807)|
| 3:00:11| Instead of having 11 separate meetings like they've done in the past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| there was an effort to go ahead and make one joint meeting to where it saves their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10816)|
| 3:00:23| and obviously everybody else have it at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10823)|
| 3:00:27| It is a information-only meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10827)|
| 3:00:32| There's no public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10832)|
| 3:00:34| It's not broadcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10834)|
| 3:00:36| It's just a meeting in the small assembly room with the finance team and some of the senior staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10836)|
| 3:00:43| Commissioner Skidmaker, I do know that the mayor has started to schedule his individual meetings with commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10843)|
| 3:00:48| and mine is on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| Mine's at 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| Oh, I know, but Evelyn, I think, is the only one affected at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10853)|
| 3:00:57| Did you say you're at 3 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| I'm at 3, and I'll just come down when we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10859)|
| 3:01:02| Okay, so everybody else is done by 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10862)|
| 3:01:04| Can we just have a show of hands who cannot make it if this date works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10864)|
| 3:01:09| May 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10869)|
| 3:01:10| We have one that can't make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| May 3rd at what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10872)|
| 3:01:13| 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10873)|
| 3:01:14| 3 o'clock. I'll just be running late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10874)|
| 3:01:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| We'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10879)|
| 3:01:20| We'll let you know once we have final notification in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10884)|
| 3:01:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10885)|
| 3:01:26| Commissioner Ryan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10886)|
| 3:01:27| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| In connection with that, I've attended the Board of Education's work session and then regular session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10889)|
| 3:01:37| and they're having difficulty with their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10897)|
| 3:01:41| The expectation is, though, that they will submit a budget to the mayor next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10901)|
| 3:01:53| That's the requirement of Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10913)|
| 3:01:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| Yeah, they have to have a budget submitted if they want their budget considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10921)|
| 3:02:06| So that's all I was trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| We can then hear what their budget is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10930)|
| 3:02:13| They just have to have a budget approved and submitted as required on the 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10933)|
| 3:02:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10939)|
| 3:02:20| Yeah, that's why we weren't going to meet before school board actually takes action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10940)|
| 3:02:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10947)|
| 3:02:28| Are there any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10954)|

| 3:02:41| but we're doing it a week later than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| It will be this Wednesday, Salmon Andes West, Aspen Square out there in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10963)|
| 3:02:47| So we encourage everybody in Farragut to come out and visit with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| All elected officials are welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10971)|
| 3:02:52| There will be no votes taken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| but we'll be glad to talk to all constituents about any problems or concerns that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10974)|
| 3:02:58| It's this Wednesday, 5 to 7 at Salmon Andes West in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=10978)|

| 3:03:32| I know the mayor is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| Is there a reason why you moved to the front row?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| Not that I have to be there, but finance you are going to have with the schools on the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11020)|
| 3:03:46| I probably will not be able to be at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| Perry will be here, and Bodie, we can make her come as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11028)|
| 3:03:52| Not that I have to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| If it's a school issue, that's perfectly fine, but I do have some conflicts on the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11033)|
| 3:04:00| The intent is a briefing from Knox County Schools Finance to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11040)|

| 3:07:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11255)|

| 3:07:37| I'll call you down in just a second, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11257)|
| 3:07:41| Could we get the report from the MPC staff, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11261)|
| 3:07:46| MPC recommended that County Commission approve the Sector Plan Amendment as well as amending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11266)|
| 3:07:54| the North City Sector Plan to LDR at a vote from 9-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11274)|

| 3:08:07| Yes, Randy Gennard, 5408 Fountain Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11287)|
| 3:08:14| We presented this property to the MPC and got a favorable vote on the 2.75 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11294)|
| 3:08:22| We had originally asked for 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| 2.75 is very acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11304)|
| 3:08:27| I've hired a professional surveyor to do a concept plan on it, which we have a concept plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11307)|
| 3:08:36| The MPC wanted to do a little bit more in-depth study on the piece of property because of some of its problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11316)|
| 3:08:46| with the railroad, flood plain, and slope protection, but we've addressed every bit of that with our concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11326)|
| 3:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11334)|
| 3:08:55| Would the opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11335)|

| 3:09:04| Try to limit your comments to five minutes, and if you can, have one or two speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11344)|
| 3:09:11| or if all three are going to speak on different subject matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11351)|

| 3:09:39| I am not very well spoken in crowds, so please excuse that, but I feel I must speak out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11379)|
| 3:09:44| My family and myself have lived on our current property for five generations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11384)|
| 3:09:48| So many happy, positive memories have been made here, not only for me, but for the other four generations as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11388)|
| 3:09:54| One of my dreams has been to build a home on my family's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11394)|
| 3:09:58| Rapidly, my dream and my family's use and enjoyment of our property is turning into a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| The same thing that damages our property and our neighbors also damages hundreds, if not thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11403)|
| 3:10:08| of other property and business owners in the city of Knoxville, Mountain City, and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11408)|
| 3:10:13| We have all noticed the increased flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| I happen to know where it is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| It's coming from developments above us in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11417)|
| 3:10:21| My family tells me the city of Knoxville realized the flooding problems here long before I was even born in the early 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11421)|

| 3:10:36| As everyone should know, development creates flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| Increasing the density for development increases larger volumes of runoff from their sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11439)|
| 3:10:43| increasing the amount of flooding to other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11443)|
| 3:10:47| What recently has stirred up the hornet's nest for my family and neighbors is the first property outside city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11447)|
| 3:10:54| It is located southeast of the railroad tracks at Beverly Road and the One Lane Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11454)|
| 3:10:59| My family and others around us call this a junk piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| a property that could not and should not be developed on for anything other than two or three homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11462)|
| 3:11:07| This property has been for sale for decades with no takers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| When the last real estate agent was putting up signs, my papa walked down and spoke with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11470)|
| 3:11:15| Mark Underwood from Southern Homes and Farms told him his recommendation for the highest value and purpose of this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11475)|
| 3:11:21| was to be divided into 15 to 20 acre tracks, which would be four or five homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| Nobody would object to that. It was a reasonable use for this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11486)|
| 3:11:30| Here recently, a county land speculator has taken an option out on this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11490)|
| 3:11:34| His first step was to go to MPC for a rezoning and sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11494)|
| 3:11:38| MPC's professional staff recommendation was to deny the rezoning sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11498)|
| 3:11:43| and place a maximum of 61 houses for the entire site of 88 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11503)|
| 3:11:47| The developer asked for a density of 2.75 per acre, which is 169 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11507)|
| 3:11:54| MPC commissioners approved his request, ignoring the professional staff's recommendation to limit development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11514)|
| 3:12:00| With the county ignoring the flooding problems, allowing county developers to violate Tennessee drainage law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| does my family, neighbors, or anyone have a future here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| The more I research, the more horrified I become.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11529)|
| 3:12:12| If the county allows such worthless property to be developed on at such densities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11532)|
| 3:12:17| it will absolutely destroy my family's property, the neighbors, and hundreds, if not thousands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11537)|
| 3:12:22| of other city property owners in the Mountain City and Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11542)|
| 3:12:27| Do you all realize there are thousands and thousands of acres in the county that is undeveloped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11547)|
| 3:12:32| If this problem is not solved now, it will continue to degrade, devalue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| and continue to increase the flooding to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11556)|
| 3:12:40| So can any of you all please help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11560)|
| 3:12:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11563)|

| 3:13:40| In 2000, a proposed condo development at Briarcliff and Tazewell Pike was not approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11620)|
| 3:13:45| and I call your attention to Dr. Smoot's report that I handed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11625)|
| 3:13:49| This report, and I have it highlighted on the second and third pages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11629)|
| 3:13:53| is by a well-known, respected environmental engineer and hydrologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11633)|
| 3:13:58| and he explained that, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| development or redevelopment in the Whites Creek area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11641)|
| 3:14:05| should limit increase in imperviousness to the greatest extent possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11645)|
| 3:14:12| Policies applied to a single development could set a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11652)|
| 3:14:17| and lead to cumulative significant detrimental changes in the watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11657)|
| 3:14:24| These effects would be extremely negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11664)|
| 3:14:27| and consist of increased property damaging flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11667)|
| 3:14:31| if higher density development than what is already present is allowed, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11671)|
| 3:14:37| Only three homes were allowed to be constructed on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11677)|
| 3:14:42| instead of 19 condos because that report was taken very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11682)|
| 3:14:49| County engineering has had a copy of this report for 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11689)|
| 3:14:54| so they're well aware that density along Whites Creek impacts downstream property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11694)|
| 3:15:02| The item before you now is asking for 169 homes on Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11702)|
| 3:15:08| If finished, it will cause flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| at a rate that hasn't been seen in Fountain City in decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11711)|
| 3:15:15| MPC professional staff said, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11715)|
| 3:15:19| and that's on your other paper there that I handed out and it's highlighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| steep slopes and floodway characteristics make this property unsuitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11723)|
| 3:15:30| for a density greater than one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11730)|
| 3:15:34| Planned residential at that density will allow reasonable development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11734)|
| 3:15:41| consistent with the sector plan and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| The extreme slopes and adjacent floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11745)|

| 3:15:56| outside the floodway, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11756)|
| 3:15:59| Sector plans provide a detailed analysis of land use and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11759)|
| 3:16:05| over a 15-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11765)|
| 3:16:08| MPC professional staff noted there had been no significant changes in conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11768)|
| 3:16:16| that would be a legal basis for an amendment to that sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11776)|
| 3:16:22| If you do vote to amend the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11782)|
| 3:16:26| a legal basis for requesting an amendment to that sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11786)|
| 3:16:31| must be clearly stated as required by law for the record of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11791)|
| 3:16:38| Because of the threat of extreme flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| and the fact that there is no legal basis for an amendment to the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11801)|
| 3:16:46| we're asking county commission to deny this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11806)|
| 3:16:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11810)|
| 3:16:51| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11811)|
| 3:16:54| Would the applicant like a rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11814)|
| 3:17:01| Yeah, I'd like my professional surveyor to speak too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11821)|
| 3:17:05| but I'd like to say that I own a business at 2109 Dutch Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| I'm very aware of the flooding as it comes up to our property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11830)|
| 3:17:14| and I certainly don't want to make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11834)|
| 3:17:26| Mr. Gennard contracted with me to look at the potential development of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11846)|
| 3:17:32| and he's going to pass out a very preliminary concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11852)|
| 3:17:37| I'm sorry, I didn't introduce myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11857)|
| 3:17:39| I'm Jim Foreman with Benchmark Associates, 10308 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11859)|
| 3:17:44| He's going to hand out a drawing that's going to represent this property developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11864)|
| 3:17:48| at the density he's requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11868)|
| 3:17:53| Consideration has been given to the existing floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| We're not impacting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| Consideration has been given to the steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11878)|
| 3:18:03| We're staying away from those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11883)|
| 3:18:05| I think it would be very instrumental for this board, this body, your commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11885)|
| 3:18:10| to consider the fact the current state of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11890)|
| 3:18:14| I have visited the property, walked the length of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11894)|
| 3:18:18| It has been logged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| There are all kinds of logging roads that are in disrepair, a lot of erosion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11900)|
| 3:18:28| sediment getting into the stream as a result of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| Development of this piece of property, quite possibly when done properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11911)|
| 3:18:36| and as I said, this plan is taken into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11916)|
| 3:18:42| good engineering practices for detention or retention, whichever comes to the forefront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11922)|
| 3:18:49| and staying out of these problem areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11929)|
| 3:18:53| just to show you that we're not asking for an aggressive density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11933)|
| 3:18:59| We're asking for a conservative density for a development such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11939)|
| 3:19:03| and I'll be happy to answer any questions you might have in those regards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11943)|
| 3:19:08| Benny, this concept drawing here shows a stubbed road at what looks like the far east end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11948)|
| 3:19:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| I did that solely because of my experience in working with MPC, a development of 150-plus units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11958)|
| 3:19:25| They're going to want an alternate way out if there can ever be afforded one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11965)|
| 3:19:29| and should that property ever develop, I'm not saying it would or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11969)|
| 3:19:32| MPC would ask that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| That's just planning according to what they would ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11975)|
| 3:19:38| Also, I don't see any detention or retention ponds on this drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11978)|
| 3:19:41| There's not any shown at this time, but there would be lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11981)|
| 3:19:44| What I was doing was generating lots that are what the current home builders are looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11984)|
| 3:19:52| roughly 55 foot wide at the front building line and 110 to 20 foot deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11992)|
| 3:19:58| Some of those lots would expire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| We've got in excess of the 169 shown on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12000)|
| 3:20:04| And this is highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12004)|
| 3:20:05| Any further development of the property in the watershed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| which would result in increases in either runoff or volume of runoff peak flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12007)|
| 3:20:12| would likely have a negative impact on downstream properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12012)|
| 3:20:17| MPC question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12017)|
| 3:20:20| The design of this would be designed to require no additional flow either in peak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12020)|
| 3:20:27| or total volume that is currently leaving the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12027)|
| 3:20:33| Potentially, yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12033)|
| 3:20:35| That would be a Knox County question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12035)|
| 3:20:36| I don't think that I could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12038)|
| 3:20:42| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| I'm kind of looking at this and looking at knowing the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12045)|
| 3:20:51| What is your drainage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12051)|
| 3:20:52| I mean, where would your drainage go that comes into culverts and basins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| and where would it go out of there, and can the capacity of the creek take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12055)|
| 3:21:00| Well, it will ultimately make its way to White's Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12060)|
| 3:21:03| There's no magical way not to let it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| But we would detain or retain the water for an excessive period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12065)|
| 3:21:10| to where the release is going to create a situation that it's released| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12070)|
| 3:21:15| after the flooding should have subsided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12075)|
| 3:21:19| Who owns the property to the east or the northeast of you that you're stubbed out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12079)|
| 3:21:24| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12084)|
| 3:21:27| That's the McMillan property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12089)|
| 3:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12094)|
| 3:21:35| And we would gladly cut that road short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| That's just less development cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| Like I said, that was just planning for what I would anticipate MPC requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12099)|
| 3:21:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12106)|
| 3:21:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12107)|
| 3:21:49| This is for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12109)|
| 3:21:51| Is the number of acreage on the application correct, the .5 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12111)|
| 3:22:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12120)|
| 3:22:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12121)|
| 3:22:02| And then looking at the ñ I have to look at both the rezoning and the sector plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12122)|
| 3:22:08| And at 2.75 acres, they would have the right, if the property allowed it, to build up to 243 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12128)|
| 3:22:17| Correct if you did 2.75 times 88.5 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12137)|
| 3:22:23| Floodplain don't count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12143)|
| 3:22:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12144)|
| 3:22:26| We would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12146)|
| 3:22:28| I'd like MPC to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12148)|
| 3:22:29| You're asking me to do math on the fly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| So I'm not 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12151)|
| 3:22:36| When you take a total track, even though there's some parts that you couldn't build on, you still take the total entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12156)|
| 3:22:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12163)|
| 3:22:44| So it would be 243 homes potential based on what the MPC is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12164)|
| 3:22:48| Potentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12168)|
| 3:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12169)|
| 3:22:50| Because it's interesting, Ms. Rowe and the other young lady mentioned 166 homes, I think, or 169 homes or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12170)|
| 3:23:00| But they potentially could do 243 homes on that property or dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12180)|
| 3:23:06| Potentially, but given the constraints of the site, I think that would be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12186)|
| 3:23:12| Is that why the staff recommended just one dwelling unit per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12192)|
| 3:23:20| Staff's recommendation was based on some concerns regarding the topography as well as water concerns, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12200)|
| 3:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12209)|
| 3:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12210)|
| 3:23:37| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12217)|
| 3:23:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12221)|
| 3:23:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12224)|
| 3:23:47| Well, this does bring a lot of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12227)|
| 3:23:52| First of all, I've lived all my life right in that area and probably going by there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12232)|
| 3:23:59| Never will forget buying the first home that my husband and I bought and moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12239)|
| 3:24:08| And the U-Haul could not go across the railroad tracks there because it was completely flooded out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12248)|
| 3:24:17| So, and that's not the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12257)|
| 3:24:21| I'm also very concerned that Mr. Gerard had emailed me six or seven weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12261)|
| 3:24:35| and told me that he was going to buy or had bought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12275)|
| 3:24:40| but I understand he is in the process of buying it if he gets everything rezoned and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12280)|
| 3:24:47| I do not know him, and so this has nothing to do with that except just the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12287)|
| 3:24:55| I told him I was very aware of this property because as long as I can remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12295)|
| 3:25:00| this property has been for sale for years, decades, decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12300)|
| 3:25:04| Not a decade, but decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| This was property that was known as one of the best sledding hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12307)|
| 3:25:12| besides going up to the top of Mountain Crest and sledding all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12312)|
| 3:25:19| So there is a lot of roughness in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12319)|
| 3:25:23| Concerned about the railroad track, the flooding, and also we have had issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12323)|
| 3:25:29| This is the same area, commissioners, that I mentioned about the big area that we had dumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12329)|
| 3:25:36| right below Tucker Steel and Steel Supply years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12336)|
| 3:25:39| which there is still some there as you cross the railroad tracks on the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12339)|
| 3:25:44| and this property we are talking about is right across on the left and goes straight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12344)|
| 3:25:49| really what we would say a mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12349)|
| 3:25:53| I have been dealing with a gentleman who lives in Fountain Gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12353)|
| 3:25:56| which is in the same subdivision that our developer lives in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12356)|
| 3:26:01| who has sinkholes in his backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12361)|
| 3:26:04| which Dwight Vandervee and the county have graciously been working with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12364)|
| 3:26:12| From the water coming down from Mountain Crest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12372)|
| 3:26:16| and I have got pictures on my phone right now that I can show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12376)|
| 3:26:20| because that is also a place that floods and used to be a little bridge, and it still floods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12380)|
| 3:26:26| And Dwight knows, way before I was even on county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12386)|
| 3:26:29| I would call him and say, Dwight, can you get some flashing lights out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12389)|
| 3:26:33| Because at night, it being in the county, it is completely pitch black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12393)|
| 3:26:37| And so when you get a really hard rain, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12397)|
| 3:26:42| You are coming up Tazewell Pike and it is flooded all the way across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| I am not talking about a little stream of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12406)|
| 3:26:48| I am talking flooded, which is now, now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12408)|
| 3:26:53| And just a few weeks ago, one of our bad rains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12413)|
| 3:26:56| and that is why I have got these updated pictures of Fountain Gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12416)|
| 3:26:59| So, and also, Harold Hills, I grew up, watched our friends be brought out in boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12419)|
| 3:27:06| I am absolutely for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| I ran on that as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12428)|
| 3:27:11| I believe in good development, and this is nothing against this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12431)|
| 3:27:17| This is, I feel, I was just by there the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12437)|
| 3:27:22| First of all, the plans, I told him I would be glad, would love to see the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12442)|
| 3:27:28| and he wanted to know if he could drop them off at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12448)|
| 3:27:31| And I said, yes, if I am not there, just leave them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12451)|
| 3:27:34| And I never heard anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12454)|
| 3:27:36| So I thought, well, nothing must be, you know, something must have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12456)|
| 3:27:41| until I saw this on our agenda and with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12461)|
| 3:27:47| And so all that to say is I am, I have known nothing but flooding in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12467)|
| 3:28:00| And we still have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12480)|
| 3:28:02| I am very concerned, and too, we still have a big pile up there at the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12482)|
| 3:28:08| And I would say that the neighbors across the street that have the cows and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12488)|
| 3:28:13| I mean, I've seen that area flood with their cows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12493)|
| 3:28:18| It's a beautiful area in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12498)|
| 3:28:21| However, I don't know, I really can't support right at this moment what is being proposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12501)|
| 3:28:32| because I'm familiar with all this, and we still have this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12512)|
| 3:28:39| Now, if we build 140-something houses or 200-something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12519)|
| 3:28:46| and there's a question, too, on here, it says there are 78 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12526)|
| 3:28:51| and on the MPC it says 88.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12531)|
| 3:28:56| So is there 78 or is there 88.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12536)|
| 3:28:59| Why is there a difference in acreage there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12539)|
| 3:29:03| Is there something not being included in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12543)|
| 3:29:06| I don't have what's in front of you, so I'm not 100% sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12546)|
| 3:29:09| I do want to clarify, I was mistaken earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12549)|
| 3:29:13| So the overall acres counted towards the density is 61.54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12553)|
| 3:29:20| It does take out the floodway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12560)|
| 3:29:22| That's not what staff included in their overall calculation for the planned residential density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12562)|
| 3:29:28| And that acreage is 18.85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| So I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| Well, that still doesn't get us to the 88.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12574)|
| 3:29:38| So if you take whatever you said, 60-something acres, and then add the 18 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12578)|
| 3:29:43| that brings us to 78 acres, but MPC's got 88.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| We pull our data off of KJS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| I'm not sure what the discrepancy is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| Glad to address that along with other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| For clarification, we're being 100% up front with you on all aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12593)|
| 3:29:58| I evaluated this property based on some surveys that I've done in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12598)|
| 3:30:03| Also, my knowledge with what the true right-of-way for the railroad is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12603)|
| 3:30:07| and if you utilize the KGIS information, it is more than we believe is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12607)|
| 3:30:13| And so 78 acres, I'm not ready to go on record as telling you that there's exactly 78,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12613)|
| 3:30:21| but that is a lot better estimation to what the actual acreage of the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12621)|
| 3:30:28| As far as flooding, we're not denying that this area has flooded in any shape, form, or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12628)|
| 3:30:34| I will tell you that with good development and good development practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12634)|
| 3:30:39| following what the engineering guidelines are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| you can actually diminish the flooding to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12642)|
| 3:30:45| and there is the potential to do that with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12645)|
| 3:30:48| You mentioned being used as a dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12648)|
| 3:30:51| There has been stuff dumped on this property in the last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12651)|
| 3:30:55| This is a community eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12655)|
| 3:30:57| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12657)|
| 3:30:58| And by developing the property with people, that portion would go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12658)|
| 3:31:03| I mean, I think, I would hope that we can see that we have an opportunity here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12663)|
| 3:31:09| to take a very bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| As I mentioned, this property has been recently logged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12671)|
| 3:31:15| There's those logging roads that are just eroding into Watts Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12675)|
| 3:31:22| I was up before MPC years ago on a piece of property above James,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12682)|
| 3:31:27| and he mentioned to me, James McMillan, who's the adjoiner upstream on this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12687)|
| 3:31:32| his biggest concern was he was a farmer, and he farmed grass for his cattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12692)|
| 3:31:37| and he couldn't have sediment in his areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12697)|
| 3:31:41| Well, all the farmland that is downstream from this right now is getting bombarded by settlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12701)|
| 3:31:46| Development of this property would most probably alleviate a good portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12706)|
| 3:31:51| Well, I am concerned that you're going to have that many homes in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12711)|
| 3:31:56| with that many cars coming in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12716)|
| 3:31:58| It's the only way getting in and out of this subdivision as it is planned now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12718)|
| 3:32:04| is right there at the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12724)|
| 3:32:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12726)|
| 3:32:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12727)|
| 3:32:08| That's the only frontage this property has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12728)|
| 3:32:11| Well, you know, right now you go up and down Beverly Road from Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12731)|
| 3:32:19| any time from 4 to 6 o'clock, and they're lined up from Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12739)|
| 3:32:23| all the way most of the time to steel supply, Tucker Steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12743)|
| 3:32:28| That's what it was when I was there when I was growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12748)|
| 3:32:31| so that's what that will always be to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12751)|
| 3:32:34| There are accidents, numerous accidents, every day right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12754)|
| 3:32:41| In fact, one night about a year ago, my husband and I were going out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12761)|
| 3:32:45| and there were two accidents right there within a half a mile of each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12765)|
| 3:32:50| from Briar Cliff pulling out and Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12770)|
| 3:32:54| Now, all of these homes, I mean, what are we going to put there for them to come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12774)|
| 3:33:01| Is there going to be a red light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| I can't speak to what will be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12783)|
| 3:33:05| but what I can speak to is any development in Knox County over 100 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12785)|
| 3:33:10| requires a traffic impact study and traffic control devices to alleviate problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12790)|
| 3:33:17| And so this zoned at this, it would classify for a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12797)|
| 3:33:24| This one is right on the curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12804)|
| 3:33:25| I don't know how many commissioners are familiar with where we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12805)|
| 3:33:29| but it's a very dangerous curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12809)|
| 3:33:32| We have sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12812)|
| 3:33:33| I've already secured and investigated that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12813)|
| 3:33:36| We have sight distance that meet the county guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12816)|
| 3:33:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12819)|
| 3:33:40| I guess mainly I wanted to see that everyone was aware of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12820)|
| 3:33:49| I was just by there the other day, and I did not see a rezoning sign, an MP sign or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12829)|
| 3:33:56| Did I miss that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12836)|
| 3:33:58| Was there one up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12838)|
| 3:34:00| Did anybody say that someone put one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12840)|
| 3:34:02| That was for the MPC meeting, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12842)|
| 3:34:04| They don't post it for our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12844)|
| 3:34:07| No, I'm talking about period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| Was there any MPC signs up there that anybody knew about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12849)|
| 3:34:20| For the rezoning meeting, there were signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12860)|
| 3:34:22| He has pictures of it in place if you need to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12862)|
| 3:34:27| Well, you know, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12867)|
| 3:34:30| I don't feel like this is my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12870)|
| 3:34:33| This is my constituents, and it's also, like I say, I mean, we have to have development in order to keep our taxes low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12873)|
| 3:34:46| This is the first I've seen of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12886)|
| 3:34:52| I was only notified that he was wanting to do a development, and he wanted to show me the plans, and I never got those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12892)|
| 3:34:59| And so just to be fair and to do what I feel like the people in District 2 elected me to do was to support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12899)|
| 3:35:11| and to do what I felt was best, and I don't feel that I have enough answers to make a good, clear decision on this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12911)|
| 3:35:23| That's no offense to our developer, who is also one of my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12923)|
| 3:35:30| This is for me to sleep tonight, and knowing all the issues that I know about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12930)|
| 3:35:38| because I was born and raised right around the corner from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12938)|
| 3:35:43| I cannot say that I can go forward with this tonight with a clear conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12943)|
| 3:35:50| without knowing more details of the plans and how the roads and how the traffic study and all that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12950)|
| 3:36:01| And also, I think our community is very, very always plugged in to what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12961)|
| 3:36:11| and so I know with all the apartments, the new apartments that went up on Tazel Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12971)|
| 3:36:17| there was meetings with that and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12977)|
| 3:36:21| And, you know, knowing how much I know about how much we still have a flood issue out there in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12981)|
| 3:36:31| I would have to maybe make a motion or something that we defer till we have a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12991)|
| 3:36:37| I don't know, but I can't vote for it tonight with a clear conscience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=12997)|
| 3:36:45| and I hope that, you know, I also know the people who own it, and this is nothing to gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13005)|
| 3:36:53| It's just hard for me to vote for something when I know how many issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13013)|
| 3:36:57| And I know this property. I've been on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13017)|
| 3:37:01| And even as a kid, I realized how slopey and all it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13021)|
| 3:37:07| or it wouldn't have been a great place to go sled and build a bonfire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13027)|
| 3:37:11| So, you know, I would love to meet, talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13031)|
| 3:37:16| I would love for everybody to get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13036)|
| 3:37:18| and I would love to see that developed in a good way for our community and for everybody around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13038)|
| 3:37:24| And I just don't have enough information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13044)|
| 3:37:27| I mean, that's all I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| I just don't have enough information to support going forward at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13049)|
| 3:37:35| I understand. I see other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13055)|
| 3:37:36| We'd be very interested to hear and respond to anybody's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13056)|
| 3:37:41| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13061)|
| 3:37:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13064)|
| 3:37:46| Amy, when was the sector plan updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13066)|
| 3:37:49| I guess it's the north city or north county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13069)|
| 3:37:55| If I remember correctly, fairly recently, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13075)|
| 3:37:59| Okay, recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13079)|
| 3:38:00| Recently, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13080)|
| 3:38:01| In terms, that's recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13081)|
| 3:38:04| Mr. Foreman or Mr. Gennard, you know, for me to vote to change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13084)|
| 3:38:09| there's got to be something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| What is it that you see that are in the five reasons that we have here for changing the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13091)|
| 3:38:17| What are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13097)|
| 3:38:21| You're probably a little bit out of my league as far as addressing sector planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13101)|
| 3:38:27| I would say that the sector plan for this was updated because the property was already zoned industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13107)|
| 3:38:34| It's been zoned industrial for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13114)|
| 3:38:38| As far as a need to consider a revision, it's obvious that this property has its constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13118)|
| 3:38:47| and that it's very difficult to develop industrially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13127)|
| 3:38:52| In its current state, I don't think there's anybody in the community that won't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13132)|
| 3:38:57| that this is a detriment to the community as it currently sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| I would be amazed if somebody could go out there and walk that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13141)|
| 3:39:05| and say this is good for anybody upstream, downstream, regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13145)|
| 3:39:11| It is a sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13151)|
| 3:39:15| I mean, leaving the property, it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| So the best thing that could happen for this property is some form of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13157)|
| 3:39:21| I think that's going to require some type of residential zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13161)|
| 3:39:25| which would require a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13165)|
| 3:39:28| It sounds like stormwater might need to go out there and see if there's any violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13168)|
| 3:39:36| You say there's erosion going into the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13176)|
| 3:39:41| Sector plan requirements for a general plan may include introduction of significant new roads or utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13181)|
| 3:39:47| obvious significant area in the mission of the plan, changes in government policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13187)|
| 3:39:53| such as decision to concentrate development in a certain area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13193)|
| 3:39:57| trends in development, population or traffic that warrants reconsideration of the original plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13197)|
| 3:40:04| or rezoning requirements from zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13204)|
| 3:40:09| I'm looking for one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13209)|
| 3:40:12| What has changed there so we can justify changing the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13212)|
| 3:40:18| I'm not sure I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13218)|
| 3:40:21| I don't know that I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| It's just MPC said it needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13223)|
| 3:40:26| MPC recommended that it be denied, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13226)|
| 3:40:31| Well, the staff, I'm sorry, the staff recommended denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13231)|
| 3:40:34| They recommended a different density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13234)|
| 3:40:37| They recommended one unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13237)|
| 3:40:40| Which you can do now as far as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13240)|
| 3:40:43| Well, it would still require a sector plan amendment, would it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13243)|
| 3:40:46| To PR in order to group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13248)|
| 3:40:49| To PR in order to group, to stay off the slopes and out of the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13249)|
| 3:40:54| Right, it would require a sector plan amendment for any type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13254)|
| 3:40:58| for the development that they're representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13258)|
| 3:41:02| The sector plan calls for agriculture, which would suit your one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13262)|
| 3:41:07| Right, that's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13267)|
| 3:41:11| But it's currently zoned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13271)|
| 3:41:13| Does that not come into play?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13273)|
| 3:41:15| Not on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13275)|
| 3:41:16| But the sector plan, what is the current?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13276)|
| 3:41:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13280)|
| 3:41:21| The sector plan currently calls for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13281)|
| 3:41:25| The current sector plan is what for the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13285)|
| 3:41:28| The current sector plan would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13288)|
| 3:41:34| Agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13294)|
| 3:41:35| It's agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13295)|
| 3:41:36| Ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13296)|
| 3:41:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13297)|
| 3:41:38| Yeah, the current plan designation is ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13298)|
| 3:41:41| Which is one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13301)|
| 3:41:47| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13309)|
| 3:41:52| MPC, could you all clarify a little bit more about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13312)|
| 3:41:55| we've got a slope and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| and I guess what they proposed or saying is going to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| Could you provide for us and for the folks who may be watching this meeting at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13321)|
| 3:42:05| just a little bit of insight on how this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| if this development goes through it actually would meet that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13327)|
| 3:42:10| I'll be honest with you, I drove the property yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13330)|
| 3:42:13| and I remember I walked away thinking this is about the biggest dog I've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13333)|
| 3:42:17| Between the railroad tracks and the farm and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13337)|
| 3:42:20| it struck me as a really awkward piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13340)|
| 3:42:22| It is something we've all acknowledged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| But could you just clarify a little bit about how they're going to meet this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13345)|
| 3:42:30| our slope and ridgetop protection plan on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13350)|
| 3:42:34| I cannot speak to how the applicant is going to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13354)|
| 3:42:37| I can tell you that we use it as a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13357)|
| 3:42:41| Yeah, it's a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| It's written in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13363)|
| 3:42:45| And it helps us when we're doing the initial analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13365)|
| 3:42:48| at looking at a rezoning application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13368)|
| 3:42:51| So we can assess, and I believe you have all this in your packet as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13371)|
| 3:42:55| but we look at the different percent of slope across the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13375)|
| 3:43:00| and we just indicate which part of that is within 0 to 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13380)|
| 3:43:06| 15 to 25 percent, 25 to 40 percent, anything over 40 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13386)|
| 3:43:11| And we make recommendations that we recommend that you stay off of those steeper slopes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| and try to concentrate your development in the flatter areas of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13395)|
| 3:43:19| And it appears as if that's what you're trying to do here, but it's still a lot of rain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13399)|
| 3:43:24| and stuff that's going to be coming down those hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13404)|
| 3:43:26| Yes, sir, we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13406)|
| 3:43:30| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13410)|
| 3:43:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13411)|
| 3:43:33| Were you present at the MPC hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13413)|
| 3:43:37| I was not personally at that particular hearing, but Mr. Gennard was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13417)|
| 3:43:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13422)|
| 3:43:44| Well, I guess my question is in looking at the minutes from the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13424)|
| 3:43:48| the MPC commissioner, who's a professional real estate developer, questioned at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13428)|
| 3:43:56| how can you build your entrance road at a 30 percent slope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13436)|
| 3:44:02| We can't, and we wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| It won't be at a 30 percent slope at the point that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13444)|
| 3:44:08| And I noticed he was one of the ones that voted against this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13448)|
| 3:44:14| which really surprised me because that is his livelihood is to do residential developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13454)|
| 3:44:20| at three-plus units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13460)|
| 3:44:24| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13464)|
| 3:44:29| At this point, given that I don't feel that we are necessarily prepared to address all your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13469)|
| 3:44:35| regarding the sector plan, I think it would be in our best interest to respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13475)|
| 3:44:41| a postponement of 30 days, give us a time to communicate with Ms. Carringer and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13481)|
| 3:44:50| and look at this again in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13490)|
| 3:44:57| Commissioner Bussel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13497)|
| 3:45:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13502)|
| 3:45:03| Looking at this right here, as the present zoning is, it says agricultural slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13503)|
| 3:45:08| stream protection, general residential and industrial, and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13508)|
| 3:45:13| Proposed is low-density residential with all those other protections on there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13513)|
| 3:45:18| going to PR, planned residential, and floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13518)|
| 3:45:25| I don't see how you're going to get that many units on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| Anyway, the only access that you're showing us here is on Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13527)|
| 3:45:32| No other place do you have access to this piece of property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13532)|
| 3:45:36| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13536)|
| 3:45:37| That's the only way that you have that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13537)|
| 3:45:40| What it appears to me is this has been overlooked or missed when they were doing sector plans and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13540)|
| 3:45:46| It's because you have all that conglomerate together when it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13546)|
| 3:45:53| This has been a problem, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13553)|
| 3:45:58| What would you say about if it was overlooked, was it an omission, or what would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13558)|
| 3:46:09| Commissioner, one of the requirements for amending the general plan is an obvious or significant error or omission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13569)|
| 3:46:19| In what it looks like to me, it's omission or it's been overlooked or just forgotten about because of the way it looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13579)|
| 3:46:27| Like I said, I don't see how you're going to do what you want to do on it, on the slope protection and all this other . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13587)|
| 3:46:33| I don't know if you could get 2.7, what you're asking for on there, once it's planned residential, to take care of all the other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13593)|
| 3:46:42| I do think you have a right to develop your land, but if you only have one entrance and exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13602)|
| 3:46:47| you can't deny giving you access to your property just because it comes out on Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13607)|
| 3:46:54| I understand that you cannot landlock a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13614)|
| 3:47:00| The floodway, when you do plan residential, the pieces of property that you're going to have close to that, I call it blue stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13620)|
| 3:47:09| I don't think there's constant water there, is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13629)|
| 3:47:14| Not on the . . . there's actually two little tributaries that go up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13634)|
| 3:47:20| Is it continual water in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13640)|
| 3:47:23| Watts Creek is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| Watts Creek, okay. So, you have one in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| So, when you do have a flooding situation, I don't know how you're going to get a building permit for those down there in that flooding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13647)|
| 3:47:35| So, I'm not sure how you're going to do all this, but in saying that, like I said, I believe it's an omission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13655)|
| 3:47:41| and it should be taken care of to where you have access to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13661)|
| 3:47:45| So, it's not my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| It's just my observation that you have to give the property owner his right to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13667)|
| 3:47:54| and if it gets zoned, whatever it gets zoned to, you have the PR, which is a very restrictive planning . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13674)|
| 3:48:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13682)|
| 3:48:04| . . . guideline, and like I said, the slopes in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13684)|
| 3:48:09| I don't know how you're going to get on some of those areas to build anything on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13689)|
| 3:48:16| So . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13696)|
| 3:48:17| All of that was taken into consideration in this plan that you see before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13697)|
| 3:48:21| I did consider the base flood elevations for Watts Creek and that flood plain through there, and we did . . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13701)|
| 3:48:28| Well, whatever we do, we need to take care of what is an omission for this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13708)|
| 3:48:34| and I'm just pointing those things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13714)|
| 3:48:36| Yes, sir, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13716)|
| 3:48:39| I'm going to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13719)|
| 3:48:40| Well, I'd like for Ms. Rowe, if she'd like to speak, and then I'll speak after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13720)|
| 3:48:44| I won't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13724)|
| 3:48:46| I just have two comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13726)|
| 3:48:48| One is the paper I handed you all about from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13728)|
| 3:48:53| If you'll look on that second page where it says deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13733)|
| 3:48:56| the third line down says the sector plan amendment is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13736)|
| 3:49:02| Secondly, regarding an omission, there was not an omission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13742)|
| 3:49:07| This particular piece of property is specifically mentioned in the North County sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13747)|
| 3:49:16| There was no omission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13756)|
| 3:49:17| They know it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| They know it's very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| There was no omission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13763)|
| 3:49:24| Excuse me, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13764)|
| 3:49:25| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13765)|
| 3:49:26| Where did you say that was, the second line down or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13766)|
| 3:49:30| Yes, on page two where it says staff recommendation, deny the request at LDR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13770)|
| 3:49:36| If you'll look on the third line of that, it starts reasonable residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13776)|
| 3:49:43| If you go down to the third line at the end of the sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13783)|
| 3:49:45| it says the sector plan amendment is not necessary if you keep the density at one dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13785)|
| 3:49:53| Is that on our copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13793)|
| 3:49:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13794)|
| 3:49:55| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13795)|
| 3:49:56| It's on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13796)|
| 3:49:57| It's on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| On this MPC thing that I handed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13799)|
| 3:50:02| Second plate, and it's highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13802)|
| 3:50:04| It should be highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13804)|
| 3:50:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13805)|
| 3:50:08| Did everybody find it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13808)|
| 3:50:24| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13824)|
| 3:50:34| If they left it at one DU, you'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13834)|
| 3:50:38| So what you're saying is they can go forward with one dwelling unit per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13838)|
| 3:50:45| and not have to do a sector plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13845)|
| 3:50:49| The MPC said that the land makes it unsuitable for a density of greater than one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13849)|
| 3:50:57| I thought the question earlier was that if it was left at one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13857)|
| 3:51:02| they still needed a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13862)|
| 3:51:04| They do not need a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13864)|
| 3:51:08| Does that make it clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13868)|
| 3:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13871)|
| 3:51:22| Well, I'm going back to what I said at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13882)|
| 3:51:28| that I'm going to make a motion that we defer this for at least 30 days until we can get together, set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13888)|
| 3:51:41| I'll be glad to do whatever to work with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13901)|
| 3:51:48| So that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13908)|
| 3:51:50| If I can get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13910)|
| 3:51:53| Would you mean to amend that motion to the May meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13913)|
| 3:51:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13918)|
| 3:51:59| I'm making a motion to defer to our May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13919)|
| 3:52:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13925)|
| 3:52:09| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| We have a motion before us to defer this to the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13931)|
| 3:52:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13936)|

| 3:52:26| We got the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13946)|
| 3:52:27| I assume it will get deferred as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13949)|
| 3:52:30| I'll do this all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13950)|
| 3:52:35| Let me go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13955)|
| 3:52:36| She needs to read it though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13956)|

| 3:52:43| The property description is the same as the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13963)|
| 3:52:56| Again, I would like to make a motion that we defer this item until our next meeting in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13976)|
| 3:53:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13985)|
| 3:53:06| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=13986)|

| 3:55:43| The MPC recommended that Knox County Commission approve PR Planned Residential zoning at a density of up to 3.5 dwelling units per acre at 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14143)|
| 3:55:55| Good evening, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14155)|
| 3:55:56| Mr. Payne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14156)|
| 3:55:57| Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| I originally requested the 5.0 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14159)|
| 3:56:04| Your name and address for the record, sir, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14164)|
| 3:56:06| Brian Pettit, 124 North Winston, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14166)|
| 3:56:11| I originally requested the 4 units an acre to go in concert with the adjoining four subdivisions easterly that were all zoned at 5 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14171)|
| 3:56:24| So that's what we applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14184)|
| 3:56:28| We would humbly appreciate your support on the 3.5 units an acre that the MPC has approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14188)|
| 3:56:38| And I'll defer to the opposition to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14198)|
| 3:56:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14205)|
| 3:56:46| Would the opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14206)|
| 3:56:49| If you would, ma'am, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14209)|
| 3:56:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14213)|
| 3:56:54| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14214)|
| 3:56:56| My name is Sue Menea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14216)|

| 3:57:04| I live at 7915 Micah Drive in Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14224)|
| 3:57:09| That's Hall's Crossroads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14229)|
| 3:57:13| I want to make it clear that we, as the opposition, are not opposed to the rezoning of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14233)|
| 3:57:23| We are opposed to the density and the problems it will create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14243)|
| 3:57:30| The drive road, for those of you who are not familiar, runs from Fort Sumter to Andersonville Pike, and this is approximately two miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14250)|
| 3:57:41| I live one-tenth of a mile from the entrance to the Berry Patch, and this property was formerly the Fruit and Berry Patch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14261)|
| 3:57:51| The marked speed limit for this road is 30 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14271)|
| 3:57:56| It was reported in May 2016 by the Knoxville News Sentinel, WBIR, and WATE that the intersection of McLeod, Hill Road, and Andersonville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14276)|
| 3:58:11| had the distinction of being one of the top ten most dangerous intersections in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14291)|
| 3:58:20| According to traffic studies, the most current information that I was able to obtain was dated 2012 to 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14300)|
| 3:58:30| There have been 22 crashes, no fatalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14310)|
| 3:58:35| Two of those crashes resulted in two of our citizens having life-sustaining, lingering effects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14315)|
| 3:58:47| Over the past few months, at the intersection of McLeod and Ventura and Micah, there have been three accidents that I personally saw that involved five automobiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14327)|
| 3:59:02| My neighbor was sitting in the traffic on McLeod, sitting in his lane, attempting to turn onto Micah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14342)|
| 3:59:11| He was hit head-on by a car that was traveling the opposite direction on McLeod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14351)|
| 3:59:19| In May 2017, the mayor gave you a five-year plan and a proposed budget that includes $100,000 for the study of this dangerous intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14359)|
| 3:59:32| The May 2018 budget will include $750,000 for improvements to this intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14372)|
| 3:59:41| Once the budget is approved, work will begin, most likely in the spring of 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14381)|
| 3:59:50| This will be a six- to nine-month endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14390)|
| 3:59:55| Properties for the improvements will most likely be taken from the surrounding neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14395)|
| 4:00:01| A temporary road may have to be installed to provide a way for traffic to move during the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14401)|
| 4:00:09| The current plans include a sidewalk from the elementary school past Hill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14409)|
| 4:00:16| The proposal was considered prior to this new subdivision of the Fruit and Berry Patch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14416)|
| 4:00:24| As I understand it, the Fruit and Berry Patch will have approximately 33 acres of buildable acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14424)|
| 4:00:34| The MCP recommended, this is the paid employees of the MPC, recommended three homes per acre at the March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14434)|
| 4:00:45| The volunteer MPC committee members overrode their recommendation and voted at the developer's request to approve 3.5 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14445)|
| 4:01:01| That would be approximately 115 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14461)|
| 4:01:05| According to statistics, each home would generate 10 trips a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14465)|
| 4:01:13| which would mean that there will be an additional 1,150 cars per day traveling on to McLeod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14473)|
| 4:01:22| McLeod cannot currently handle the traffic during rush hours, much less an additional 1,150 cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14482)|
| 4:01:32| I have three pictures here of Andersonville Pike at the height of the Halls Elementary School being let out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14492)|
| 4:01:43| plus McLeod Road at the intersection of old Andersonville Pike at 3.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14503)|
| 4:01:49| I'd be happy to pass this around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14509)|
| 4:01:58| With an additional 1,150 cars on McLeod, will this newly designed intersection that you're going to spend $750,000 to improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14518)|
| 4:02:14| will that improvement be out of date with an 1,150 additional cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14534)|
| 4:02:23| Something must be done with the McLeod Hill Road and Andersonville Pike intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14543)|
| 4:02:29| The work on this intersection, plus the new Fruit and Berry Patch development, will be a nightmare for all of us who live in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14549)|
| 4:02:38| We have three schools, elementary, middle, and high schools, that are located within two miles of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14558)|
| 4:02:48| A new turning lane was installed for entry to the elementary school, but the narrow bridge that sits just below the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14568)|
| 4:02:55| that is east of the school, was not touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14575)|
| 4:02:59| One of our neighbor's trucks has been hit three times going over this narrow bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14579)|
| 4:03:07| Morning and afternoon is still a nightmare, not only for the parents, but also for the regular traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14587)|
| 4:03:16| It is not unusual for traffic to be backed up from the school in one direction to Emory Road, this is the elementary school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14596)|
| 4:03:23| from one direction to Emory Road and from the other direction to Hill Road, even with these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14603)|
| 4:03:31| Emergency vehicles have a difficult time in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14611)|
| 4:03:35| In November 2013, rural metro engine number 230 turned over at 9 a.m. on a non-emergency assignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14615)|
| 4:03:47| resulting in power outages at all three halls' schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14627)|
| 4:03:53| What if it had been a true emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14633)|
| 4:03:57| There are two businesses that need to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14637)|
| 4:04:02| That's the Elmcroft Residential Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14642)|
| 4:04:06| They have residential assisted living and they also treat persons with memory losses or make a home for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14646)|
| 4:04:16| Hopefully, the hospice center will be reopened very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14656)|
| 4:04:22| Both of these facilities have frequent emergencies and they are across the street from the grade school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14662)|
| 4:04:29| Last night, we had an emergency at Elmcroft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14669)|
| 4:04:33| The sprinkler system went off and the alarm rang to several fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14673)|
| 4:04:43| We had five trucks emerge on Elmcroft, not knowing what they were responding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14683)|
| 4:04:52| If this had happened during the day, I don't know how they would have ever gotten through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14692)|
| 4:05:02| The developers of this property, they're going to come in, they're going to do their thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14702)|
| 4:05:08| and then they're going to back to their homes and they're going to leave the traffic problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14708)|
| 4:05:13| for the McLeod neighbors to contend with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14713)|
| 4:05:17| Development is good, but how much development provides a healthy, safe environment for our neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14717)|
| 4:05:26| Now is the time for this commission to set a better course for a brighter future for Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14726)|
| 4:05:35| You can be the first commission to take a stand for the trees, the green space, and general overcrowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14735)|
| 4:05:45| Will you take that step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14745)|
| 4:05:48| Will you be the commission that says it's time for us to look at the environmental concerns of Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14748)|
| 4:05:56| Will this be your legacy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14756)|
| 4:05:59| We sincerely ask that you consider these points when making your decision for the density of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14759)|
| 4:06:08| Now is the time to protect our environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14768)|
| 4:06:12| We ask that you approve planned residential zoning with not more than two and a half homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14772)|
| 4:06:23| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14783)|
| 4:06:27| Does the applicant have a rebuttal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14787)|
| 4:06:33| Only to say that I believe the intersection she's talking about is about a half a mile down the road from the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14793)|
| 4:06:40| so any new development will bring in what the study will show in the additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14800)|
| 4:06:47| We do understand that, but I'm not sure what I can do to help from that standpoint of that particular intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14807)|
| 4:06:56| I will say when we first started and we reached out to have this piece of property rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14816)|
| 4:07:03| there was a meeting gathered at the Halls Library that I got wind of, and I attended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14823)|
| 4:07:10| Mr. Commissioner Buschler also attended that meeting, and I was really glad that I went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14830)|
| 4:07:16| There was about 20, 25 folks there, and so I was able to at least comment on a lot of the rumors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14836)|
| 4:07:24| some of the things that was floating around that was going to be happening on the property that just wasn't so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14844)|
| 4:07:30| I was able to talk about a lot of the processes, a lot of the procedures, regulations, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14850)|
| 4:07:36| and I think it was good for a lot of the folks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14856)|
| 4:07:39| However, some of the folks have got the traffic concerns that I just simply don't have a good answer to them for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14859)|
| 4:07:50| I do understand that a development of this size will require the traffic study to be completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14870)|
| 4:07:56| and naturally we'll need to do what we can to negate anything from a safety nature entering and exiting that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14876)|
| 4:08:05| On an economic feasibility standpoint, the property that we do have that we're looking to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14885)|
| 4:08:13| we believe it to be 38 acres, and the reason I say that, our survey shows 44 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14893)|
| 4:08:20| That survey was done back in 1935.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14900)|
| 4:08:23| It literally refers to stumps and rocks as points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14903)|
| 4:08:28| but we do have a couple subdivisions that we're able to pull some good marks off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14908)|
| 4:08:32| and it's going to match up a whole lot closer with what the KGIS mapping is showing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14912)|
| 4:08:37| so I think we're looking at more of the 38 than 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14917)|
| 4:08:43| Also, a couple things to note, the rear part of this property, there's some topography back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14923)|
| 4:08:49| as well as a real large powerline easement and a large pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14929)|
| 4:08:54| so the subdivision to the rear of this property is going to have a large natural buffer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14934)|
| 4:09:01| I've been in several conversations with the Neighborhood Association president directly adjoining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14941)|
| 4:09:11| There's only one subdivision that directly adjoins this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14951)|
| 4:09:15| and he's in support of our project as well as our density that we're requiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14955)|
| 4:09:22| He's asked us to help out with some screening, which we are certainly willing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14962)|
| 4:09:28| but a very nice gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14968)|
| 4:09:30| That subdivision, by the way, its actual density is 3.6 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14970)|
| 4:09:37| The next one over is actually 4.9 units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14977)|
| 4:09:41| even though they're all zoned 5 units an acre, the four subdivisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14981)|
| 4:09:46| we feel like we need the 3.5 from an economic standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14986)|
| 4:09:52| We're going to have a lot left over land that we're going to leave natural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14992)|
| 4:09:57| So to absorb those costs, we need that type of density, and I would appreciate a vote of 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=14997)|
| 4:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15006)|
| 4:10:08| Commissioner Boston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15008)|
| 4:10:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15009)|
| 4:10:10| I was at that meeting, and I was trying to explain the situation out there about the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15010)|
| 4:10:18| and where all of those three roads came together, Andersonville, Pike, Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15018)|
| 4:10:24| But anyway, we've been looking to cure that problem for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15024)|
| 4:10:31| In fact, when I first got elected almost four years ago, when you have PR residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15031)|
| 4:10:37| and I'm going to explain this right up front so you will understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15037)|
| 4:10:40| there's a lot of things under PR that the developer has to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15040)|
| 4:10:44| First of all, the roads, he's got to make sure it's developed to where it does not put adverse effect on the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15044)|
| 4:10:53| There is a plan to correct that part of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15053)|
| 4:10:57| They'll also have to deal with where they go on to the major collector roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15057)|
| 4:11:02| how that traffic will flow on down over that small bridge, which needs to be redone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15062)|
| 4:11:08| That's some of the other things that will have to be addressed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15068)|
| 4:11:11| And also a lot of the other, in the topography on the back of that, you have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15071)|
| 4:11:16| is there a parallel line that goes through there also, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15076)|
| 4:11:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15079)|
| 4:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15080)|
| 4:11:21| And it's a major fall off that goes down at the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15081)|
| 4:11:25| So I'm not sure he can even get 3.5 on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15085)|
| 4:11:29| But with this number of units that goes on there, he'll have to, will you stub out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15089)|
| 4:11:34| I think under MPC you would require, what, two entrances to that piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15094)|
| 4:11:40| I'm not sure about that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15100)|
| 4:11:42| I'm going to ask the MP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15102)|
| 4:11:45| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15105)|
| 4:11:46| That's something that we would talk about when we got to that stage, looking at the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15106)|
| 4:11:50| So then you'd have to address the other issues too, but you'd have to have at least two entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15110)|
| 4:11:55| and where they come in and out they would have to have the site distance and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15115)|
| 4:11:59| So those issues will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15119)|
| 4:12:01| And that property will be developed out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15121)|
| 4:12:03| And as we talked to that night, Mr. Fox has a right to sell his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15123)|
| 4:12:11| And he has a right to get what he can out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15131)|
| 4:12:14| That's his right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15134)|
| 4:12:16| And so this is good neighbors to support his decision to sell that after that many years in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15136)|
| 4:12:22| So in saying that, I'm going to make a motion that we go with MPC recommendations of 3.5 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15142)|
| 4:12:28| and the zoning is PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15148)|
| 4:12:33| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15153)|
| 4:12:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15154)|
| 4:12:35| Commissioner Neisner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15155)|
| 4:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15158)|
| 4:12:41| To be clear, I like this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15161)|
| 4:12:44| The fact that you're putting in some new residences near a school, you're in a school zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15164)|
| 4:12:49| so you're going to have to have sidewalks in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15169)|
| 4:12:51| You're close to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15171)|
| 4:12:52| I'm curious, what is the price point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15172)|
| 4:12:55| Because we always need more affordable houses in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15175)|
| 4:12:58| What sort of price point are you looking to price these units at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15178)|
| 4:13:01| I will not be the home builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15181)|
| 4:13:03| I'm just the developer of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15183)|
| 4:13:05| You're building up to the curbs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15185)|
| 4:13:06| You're building the curbs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15186)|
| 4:13:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15187)|
| 4:13:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15188)|
| 4:13:09| What do you anticipate your lot cost, your lot sales point being?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15189)|
| 4:13:14| I'm not sure that I would like to give that information out at this point because I have not secured a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15194)|
| 4:13:22| I do have an active LOI, but, again, I do not have a full-bledged contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15202)|
| 4:13:27| so I don't mind to share that at that appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15207)|
| 4:13:31| Let me ask you this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| You're just doing the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| You do not have a developer or somebody that's going to be building all the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15215)|
| 4:13:43| I think that that was unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15223)|
| 4:13:45| And the person that they said was going to be building that unit out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15225)|
| 4:13:48| I talked to that person personally, and that group is not building in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15228)|
| 4:13:53| I just want to let you all know that out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15233)|
| 4:13:56| And to this date, I've yet to ever have a conversation with that person that was rumored to come in to build those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15236)|
| 4:14:02| Well, I had a great conversation, so, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15242)|
| 4:14:07| I'll call for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15247)|
| 4:14:09| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15249)|
| 4:14:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15250)|
| 4:14:12| I'm on page two because MPC staff recommendation says zoning at a density up to three acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15252)|
| 4:14:20| and we're looking at 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15260)|
| 4:14:23| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15263)|
| 4:14:24| Is that what the developer is asking there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15264)|
| 4:14:27| The MPC voted unanimously to approve 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15267)|
| 4:14:38| I applied for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15278)|
| 4:14:40| I'm on page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15280)|
| 4:14:41| I applied for five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| The staff recommended three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15283)|
| 4:14:47| After hearing the commissioners voted unanimously to approve 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15287)|
| 4:14:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| The commission said vote 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15297)|
| 4:15:09| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| So this is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15311)|
| 4:15:13| I'm looking at something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15313)|
| 4:15:15| Let me just scroll down again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15315)|
| 4:15:20| This says three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15320)|
| 4:15:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15326)|
| 4:15:28| Three units per acre was recommended by your paid MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15328)|
| 4:15:34| And the MPC commission passed 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15334)|
| 4:15:37| The volunteer committee voted to override your paid staff recommendation of three to suit the builder at 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15337)|
| 4:15:48| Yes, ma'am, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15348)|
| 4:15:49| I was trying to offer some clarification on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15349)|
| 4:15:52| I thought I missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15352)|
| 4:15:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15353)|
| 4:15:56| Anything else, Ms. McGill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15356)|
| 4:15:58| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15358)|
| 4:15:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| We have a motion before us to approve at 3.5 units per acre PR for MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15361)|
| 4:16:11| We have a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15373)|
| 4:16:18| Seeing none, we'll call for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15378)|
| 4:16:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15380)|
| 4:16:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15382)|

| 4:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15386)|
| 4:16:27| That is, would the noes please raise their hand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15387)|
| 4:16:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15391)|
| 4:16:32| Did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15392)|
| 4:16:33| So it's a 9-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15393)|
| 4:16:36| Commissioner Gill and Commissioner Stenberg are voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15396)|
| 4:16:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15399)|
| 4:16:42| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15402)|

| 4:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15408)|
| 4:16:49| Is there anything else that this body needs to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15409)|
| 4:16:55| Any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15415)|
| 4:16:59| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15419)|

| 4:17:08| I appreciate the current arrogance of the political environment we live in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15428)|
| 4:17:13| but don't approach me in a nonprofessional manner that doesn't present a professional decorum to this body again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180423?start=15433)|
