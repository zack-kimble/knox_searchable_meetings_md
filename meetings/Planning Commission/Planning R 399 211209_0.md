| 0:08:29| A 30-day postponement is a good thing to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| I would suggest to the City of Newark, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| Commissioner, if you could pull your microphone down, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I would not be in favor of a 30-day postponement because it is the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=522)|
| 0:08:50| And very little would get done between now and the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=530)|
| 0:08:57| I would suggest that it go on 60- or 90-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| Well, right now we have a request for a 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| But we don't have a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Well, we don't have a second on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Do we have a motion by Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| I guess at this point, do we have a second to Commissioner Roth's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| We do have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| So if that is approved, Commissioner, then it will be a 30-day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=564)|
| 0:09:29| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| And I think that we're doing the wrong thing by postponing for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| Commissioner Roth, are you here to amend your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| Well, the applicant is the one that requested the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| So I think if he amends his request, we probably could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| But I don't think I can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| I'm not comfortable amending it without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| So we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| We don't have to include that either in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| Well, right now we have a motion and a second to include items 19 and 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| Chair will recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| I would just ask Commissioner Graf if he would elaborate a little bit more as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| what could or couldn't get done in the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Well, that they could meet or get something worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| There's a lot of opposition to this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| If they could get part of that worked out, something worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| nothing worked out, obviously they haven't talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| What if they get it worked out in the 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| They could always come back 30 days from now and get another postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=641)|
| 0:10:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| But in the next 30 days, if you had something on the agenda that gives the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=653)|
| 0:11:05| neighborhood time to get organized, the sign wasn't posted when it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=665)|
| 0:11:14| supposed to have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| I wasn't going to bring that up, but it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| And they could have asked for the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| I just think that you're trying to put too much in a short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=689)|
| 0:11:39| that there would be any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Even if the applicant, he's the one that asked for it, but you're asking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=704)|
| 0:11:55| neighborhood to formulate some sort of a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| How do you do that when, well, I'll be out of town next week, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| other guy's out of town the following week, and then, you know, how do you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| together this time of year to talk about a rezoning issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| Well, I think if we come 30 days from now and they say everybody seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| satisfied, then there would be no need to further extend it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=743)|
| 0:12:27| We could kind of gauge it as we go, is what I'm suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| Commissioners, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=754)|

| 0:20:22| Sorry, we skipped item number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| It was just removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| It was removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| This is the one we're doing right now, 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| It was removed, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Zoning requested PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1236)|

| 0:20:55| because it is consistent with surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| and the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1259)|

| 0:21:15| Mr. Murphy, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| I'm here because the Knox County Planning Alliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| and the Hardin Valley Planning Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| we submitted a joint statement to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| about Hardin Valley in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| and this is the first item that's in the Hardin Valley area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1293)|
| 0:21:37| on your agenda today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| so I'd kind of like to give you some overall context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| which does apply to this item and all the other items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| that are in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| This month, the agenda, when we were looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| it really drove home what the cumulative impact is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| There are some very large rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| and subdivision requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| and then this follows several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| of a lot of development out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| If you look at the agenda that's in front of you today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| if you approve what is being requested by the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| you'd approve developers starting to move dirt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| on about 295 new houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| that once built would create nearly 3,000 new trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| on the valley roads in a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| and they'd add about 112 new students to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| that, as of today, are 610 students over capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| for the three Hardin Valley schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| That's already what's been granted through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| or vested in rights through rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| so that's simply just approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| what's already been done recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Then with rezonings, where they're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1352)|
| 0:22:34| for additional authority to build for land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| the estimates there from the applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| up to 506 additional units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| That's another 4,900 trips per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| and another 208 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| And when you look at rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| when you're in a rezoning action like this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| you're looking at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| You're looking at the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| and the land use chart in it and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| but you're also looking at the infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| the schools, the education, the community facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| and you're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| how is this area able to support the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| in land use under zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And that's why it's important to really take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| and have some deliberation and conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| So somebody, you know, the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| that are here today for rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| they're requesting a change in the property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| that will be vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| and it's the Planning Commission's job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| to evaluate that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| and ask how it will impact the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| And when we look at the Hardin Valley community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| you know, in terms of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| it's not looking really healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| You know, the schools, again, 610 students over capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| The elementary school has five portables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| two more have been ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| Class sizes are maxed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| The parents here can tell you better than I can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| but the schools, the administrators, the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| they're all very stressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| And if you've got some representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| from the school system here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| it'd be great to ask them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| how the schools are doing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| So there's that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| There's utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| West Knox Utility District, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| yes, they've got a new wastewater treatment plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| which is fantastic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| but they've also got a lot of capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| I've heard about, like, 5.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| just in, like, sewage lip stations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| including one, you know, that's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| to serve the existing schools in the Couchmill Road area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| You know, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| And West Knox has actually stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| that the infrastructure costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| that come along with the increased customers and growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| that's...those costs are exceeding their revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| So the growth, you know, there you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| You know, growth isn't actually paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| for itself in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| Parks and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| you can also take a look at how that's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| We're five years out from where the last sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| was approved, so you can kind of look at, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Where is everything, you know, that was in the five-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| You know, there was supposed to be some acquisition of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| for a Hardin Valley community center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| That hasn't happened yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| and there was one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| and that one has actually been demolished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| and the athletic field's taken away from it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| due to unsafe conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| So they're actually taking a step backwards out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| And then finally, in the land-use programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| which that's in your wheelhouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| there are some items in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| Six of them in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| you know, we did...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| One was finished, the rural preservation zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| although in the entire county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1524)|
| 0:25:26| there's not any land that's zoned rural preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| The other five items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| around land-use policies and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| haven't even started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| So there was something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| about conservation subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1536)|
| 0:25:38| and subdivision ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| That hasn't started yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Sidewalks, there was a change in the county ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| but that kind of has taken a step backwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| and there's less sidewalks being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| So that's the big use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| you know, the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| Land-use decisions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| that have happened since the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| they're still creating a lot of growth pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| where the infrastructure hasn't caught up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| So we're hoping you'll take a step back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| look at the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| starting with this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| I know it's only 3 1⁄2 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| and I know it's not going to impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| the greater Hardin Valley community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Will this rezoning be a benefit to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| Will it positively help initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| identified in the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| That's all for you to deliberate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| and I appreciate your time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| Thank you for your comments, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Your name and address, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| for the record, and you have up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Thank you, Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| Myself, Vineet Sharma, and I'm representing this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I'd like to thank Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| for bringing some facts and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| stats on the board, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| say this is the need of the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1604)|
| 0:26:46| The influx of people, talent, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| industries we are seeing coming into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| East Tennessee demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| new infrastructure, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| what we are trying to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| If we won't do it, somebody else is going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| So let's meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| the pace, provide some infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Farragut is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| already occupied. Now it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| time for the Hardin Valley to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| up with the good schools. When the people are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| to come up, school districts are going to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| We're going to have a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| emerging generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| location of this particular segment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| is at the edge of the Hardin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| Valley. That is perfect, and we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| not bringing 200, 300 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| It's just 15 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| If 15 families can find a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| school district at the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| near to the airport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1652)|
| 0:27:34| I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| again a community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Thank you, Mr. Sharma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1662)|

| 0:27:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| planned residential per staff recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| We have a motion by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| Ross, seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| PPR plan residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| technology overlay zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| up to three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| All in favor of the motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| I'm sorry, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| you know, I look at this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| being right next to Pellissippi on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| good road, adjoining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| six units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| sector plan all around is medium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| I think I would have supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| four units an acre on this as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| since this was pulled off and we get a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| to relook at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| The status of our housing inventory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| right now in Knoxville and the people we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| moving to town, we have got to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| more comfortable at four units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| just it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| Please hold your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| The Commissioner has a right to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Yeah, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| I think especially right here, we're right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| next to Pellissippi| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| on a highly traveled road, surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| with appropriate sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| we routinely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| in the city of Knoxville are at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| seven to ten units an acre on small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| infill tracks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| density is not anything to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| run away from. It allows us to be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| creative with what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=1766)|

| 0:35:04| that would be required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2104)|

| 0:35:22| for many, many moons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| In fact, it was just completed recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| although the contract has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2126)|

| 0:35:32| That was done just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| for safety purposes only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2134)|

| 0:35:54| reduced the number and severity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| of existing crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2156)|

| 0:36:02| from the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| that we have provided, going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| back at least to 2010| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2166)|

| 0:36:12| Chapman Highway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| is a busy highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| So we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| any new roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| That project was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| in place, in contemplation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| funding and then finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| completed just now before the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| sector plan amendment was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| for that area. Additionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| the area where the development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| looking to go is outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| the planned growth area. The planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| growth area, the closest it gets to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| is at the Valley Grove Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Valley Grove Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| is responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| any utility that has been extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| to that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Now those extensions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| actual wastewater lines have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| in existence since 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Again, ahead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| at least two sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| that have been adopted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| So for those reasons we strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| believe that there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| increase in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| new utilities available there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| or new roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| it was purely safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| for the Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| Additionally the area has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| substantially changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| It is a rural neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| rural in character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| The proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| conflicts with the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| neighborhood uses. We have rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| single family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| We have a historic home right across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| which happens to be owned by my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| We have a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| that is an excellent community member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| and then we have a rather large cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| So at that end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| there is a variable pie where it intersects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| in with Simpson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| to Chapman Highway. It's very rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| in characteristics and always has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| been. Spot zoning is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| not supported by the current sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| plan or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| amendment is going to open the gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| There is nothing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| obligate this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2286)|
| 0:38:08| if sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| is amended, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| the planned residential component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| of the zoning is granted here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2294)|

| 0:38:23| from planning's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| permits that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| see on the maps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| We have identified 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| residential single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2311)|

| 0:38:41| that we have seen on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| the, as I would call it, the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| hand of Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| has just simply not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| been there. It is decidedly rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| in characteristic and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| see the growth there. There has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| some growth on the right hand side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| of Chapman Highway, but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| those developments that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| coming online or have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2341)|

| 0:39:15| of those projects were approved prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| to the last sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| They are in the planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| growth area. The area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| chosen by this developer for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| we believe is the first phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| frankly is, it's rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| it's outside of the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| Although there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2375)|

| 0:39:43| one meet and greet meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2383)|

| 0:39:47| plans provided. They have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| provided any cost analysis for what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| it would cost to run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| these lines and to tie on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| existing services. Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2395)|

| 0:40:29| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| My name is Margie Grace and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| I am resident at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2433)|

| 0:40:39| from 8802. First I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| start with thanking you for hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| I live in a historical house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| right across the street from the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| It was built in 1930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| It has significant architecture and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| comes complete with a bronze plaque| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| out on the road of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| I assume the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| is very proud. It's a historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| site as well. It was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| stagecoach stop between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Knoxville and Sevierville from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| 1837 to 1903 when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| service ended. It's retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| stonework from that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| The reason why the livery stable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| was sited there and why the tavern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| was sited there and why the stop was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| was because there are springs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| that can be counted on year round| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| and these springs in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| seven or eight are on our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| which is three acres and zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2487)|

| 0:41:31| area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| That occurs all throughout the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| including that on 8802| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| and together that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| property is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| watershed of Hines Creek and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| together form the headwaters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| of Hines Creek that eventually leads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| to the broad French River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| It's important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| that I've been a landscape designer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| and a contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| and I've been a zoner for the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| 42 years. I know both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| sides of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| I've worked both sides of this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| that which befalls us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| the most important, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| entrusted in our hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| is to do smart development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| I believe in property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I believe in honoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| our contracts with our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| figures on such things as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| sector plans, a well reasoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| and well thought out and honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| plan that was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| by the community. I also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| believe that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| honor the zoning. Before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| found our dream house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| this peaceful rural lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| with water, woods, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| wildlife, we did the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| We all lie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| our lot lies in agriculture zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| our lot lies outside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| growth area and we are surrounded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| by parcels that are done the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| I got, we do not own that parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| across the street, but by God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| I expect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| which we have created together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| we will honor. So it came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| as quite a shock, you can imagine, when the bulldozers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| rode up and they started taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| down the woods. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| now graced with the 65 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| across the street that are part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| the original, well the original proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| for this developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| we are left with giant brush| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| piles, we are left with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| about 33,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| trees have been taken down. The turkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| the deer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| the wildlife are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| So, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| grave environmental concerns about what lies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| across the street. We have seen this destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| of habitat, we have seen a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| complete loss of the native plant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| community and the on-site ecology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| has been destroyed. The entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| biome is irreparably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| damaged. We have grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| over there greater than an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| it includes modification of the creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| although the developer says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| no. There are two TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| cases being, complaints being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| examined. One has been referred back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| to Knox County for the excessive grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| and one has been referred to the State| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| Forestry Department. Those are unresolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| at this point. We are going to have erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| on these soils that have been opened up of greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| than an acre and we'll have siltation in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| the waterways. Speaking of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| hydrology, I am not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2653)|

| 0:44:17| the field. We have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| streams there, blue water streams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| and two wet water conveyances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| as of October 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2663)|

| 0:44:37| your time has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| If you could wrap up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| your comments and then we'll see if the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| wants to allow extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Thank you. This bat cave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| is, per Gary McCracken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| likely the source of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2689)|

| 0:45:01| per federal rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| a study before any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| development is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| I would ask that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Are you concluding your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2711)|

| 0:45:15| Please hurry. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I would ask that an environmental impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2717)|
| 0:45:19| study be done before any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| is granted. And finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=2721)|

| 0:52:31| miles, two-thirds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| that, and I've gone through and measured it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| two-thirds of that does not have a center left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3155)|

| 0:52:45| concern is not so much the immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3165)|

| 0:52:59| My biggest concern is between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| here, those seven miles of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| roadway, two-thirds of which does not have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| center left turn lane. My concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| is public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| That's my comments. Thank you very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| The opposition has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3193)|

| 0:53:19| Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| So let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| address a couple things, and Mr. Childress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| is a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| well-known traffic engineer in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| a little confused. I think we're only asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| 270 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| plus or minus a couple, and he said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| 475, so I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| where that disconnect may come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| So anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| yeah, rule in character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| and I get part of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| when I start looking at what's around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| the development, and I see an industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| park, I see other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| commercial things, and we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| the terminus of Sevierville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| We're not in the middle of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| Sevierville Pike, and that terminus is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| at or near Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| We do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| availability of water and sewer. We do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| availability of a four-lane road, and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Mr. Childress mentioned, it does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| have a center turn lane. It has not had a center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| turn lane forever, and these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| are some of the improvements that are going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| and have been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| for some time. It's not a volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| thing. We're adding more volume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| potentially to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Chapman Highway, but we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| creating any geometric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| issues that make it less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| safe. One of the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| was mentioned was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| the destruction of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| current property. We've had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| streams analyzed by a professional firm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| and verified by the Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| of Environment and Conservation. I've got a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| to the office that didn't bring it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| but they verified the findings that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| It's not like we've gone out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| and tried to go rogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| He also mentioned that we've taken some fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| rows down, and that's exactly right. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| cleaned the property up. We actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| called TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| because Knox County, and if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| want to get up and speak to this, can. Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| County's been out to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Interestingly, they were out to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| after the rezoning sign came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3315)|
| 0:55:17| not before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| some of the clearing began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Knox County did not find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| that there were issues there. Neither did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| TDEC. My conversations with the TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| people, when I talked to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| said that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| have not been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| and everything is okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| they went by the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| and found no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| I appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3343)|
| 0:55:45| there's a historical site across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| but we're not going on to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| property. We're not building adjacent to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| And I would also submit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| historical sites in many, many locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| have existed and coexisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| with developments near them or beside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| them. I think if you go downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| you see several instances of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| where buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| large-density buildings have been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| right beside historical sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| this is going on and people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| are frustrated. I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| on a farm myself, and I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| five or six subdivisions around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| We have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| and it's amazing, though, with five or six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| subdivisions, how we still see deer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| turkey, foxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| coyotes, and all those kind of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| still there because they primarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| nest in the areas of the woods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| which we're not trying to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| with. Our goal is to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| to the upper side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| property and not get into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| That's one of the reasons I think that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| MPC has given us some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| of the recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| is we're trying to develop in the parts of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| that can be developed, not trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| develop in parts that, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| don't make sense to develop in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Again, getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| had an attorney to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| sector plan, growth plan, and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| I'm not sure, and again, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| something for legal to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| I'm not sure how valid that growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| is anymore. I mean, it's not been really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| adjudicated in quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| period of time. We have had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3444)|
| 0:57:26| changes. We've had changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| in the entire area that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| there, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I don't think that this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| quote, rural area. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| when I just look at the map, and I'll drive back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| in there, and I see industry, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| see churches, and I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| please, I didn't like doing what you all said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| I just don't see the rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| that is being shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| here. We're at the terminus of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| Sevierville Park at Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| There are parts of Sevierville Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| that you go down that don't have anything, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| see subdivision houses along one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| road. I see LBR here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| Again, it just doesn't appear to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| based on what I've seen in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| where you start at intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| and go more dense to less dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| So, that's up to me. And again, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| think most of everything else that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| wanted to say, what NBC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| put in their recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| for the density they recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| is well put, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| I'll stay there. Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| Chair, we'll open up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| commission comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3510)|
| 0:58:40| One of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| I think needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| stated to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| for me, a little more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| To me, for me, a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| clearly in a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| and I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| I'm not going to make a recommendation yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| because there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| fellow commissioners that want to make comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| so I'm going to make sure they have the time and ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| to do that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| respect their thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| What I do feel, though, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| once we get to a point where we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| to make a recommendation one way or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| the other, if we happen to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| one that echoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| I am going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| I am going to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| that we do less density than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| staff has recommended, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| I'm going to want to make it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| even though it's not going to be a defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| area, I'm going to make it more clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| put into the record that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| that zoning density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| would be subject to concentrating it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| on the more developable parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| of the property, as the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| I'm not going to want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| them with the ability to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| on the steep part of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| If we think that overall density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| on this acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| with the density that I can come up with later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| if I need to, I'm happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| But I want to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| shortening the area of where they can develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| One is similar to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| Commissioner Newton was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| because that's where a lot of our conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| focused on during the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| The recommendation of having one area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| only have one acre, and then we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| do we want to disturb that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| So I'm very interested in that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| But the other question I have is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| about the growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| and the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| There was a comment submitted by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| a community member that showed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| just really clearly, like, here's where the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| is, here's where the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| And this development isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| and this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| is not in the growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| So I question, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| this is for staff, just to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| better, since it is outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| of the growth area, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| the rationale is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| approving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Yes, this is Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| to reference the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| from 2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| and the description of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| extensions of low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| into the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Liz, could you speak up a little louder, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| Yes, sorry. I'd like to reference the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| plan that was adopted in 2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| that references extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| of low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| in the rural area subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| to several conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| The following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| policy shall apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| to the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| This is section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| Extensions of low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| development, densities of 1 to 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| dwelling units per acre into the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| shall be limited to the following conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| The property must be zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| planned residential, provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| of sanitary sewer and public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| water services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| connecting collector and arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| roads from the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| to the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| or the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| which meet the standards of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| And then D, a traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| impact analysis demonstrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| to the satisfaction of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| Planning Commission that the effect of the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| and similar developments in the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| analysis zone will not unreasonably impair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| traffic along the arterial roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| through the adjacent planned growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| So it's the intent of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| section to allow extensions of LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| into rural areas when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| urban services and adequate roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| become available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| And these areas should be reclassified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| as planned growth when the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| is periodically revised and amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| Thank you, Ms. Albridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Commissioner Adams, do you have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Yeah, if you would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3808)|
| 1:03:30| I'd like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| two questions of the applicant and then one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| back to Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| You mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| that you were going to stay off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| steeper area, is that right? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| So your plan is to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| although you might try to pick up a little density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| out of that acreage, but you're going to leave the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| mountainous wooded areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| the way they are and you're going to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| the flat areas, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| I mean...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| Hold your comments, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| Well, that's just a question that I'm asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| Evidently, I've got other people that need to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| But the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| I mean, it's not economical, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Commissioner Smith, it's not economical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| And there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| other issues that come with trying to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| on property that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| literally 40% slopes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| And there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| large gas line that runs back through there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| that can create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| some issues. So we just want to stay away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Okay, the second question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| You mentioned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| you had requested a density of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| Did you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| 274?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| We requested a density of 4 an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| but then staff came back with their analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| that came back to, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| it was 250...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| I'll have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| the numbers. It's 252 or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| like that. 257.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| That's all I have for you now. One for Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Liz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| First of all, Liz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| based on what you just read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| is a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| I wouldn't say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| it's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| If I heard you right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| you can...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| It says it's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| But you could approve up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| one to three with sewer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| adequate roads, and all that you listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| in the rural area. Did I hear you right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| That's my understanding that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| not be in violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| of the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| but it doesn't necessarily mean that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| have to make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| extensions. Okay, last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| What on this was your justification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| or the staff's justification for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| the sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| So we've noted in the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| recommendation, as is written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| here, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| access and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| improvements on a major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| arterial Chapman Highway near the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| and because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| slope analysis, or sorry, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| slope analysis showed a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| recommended density of almost up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| two dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| for the flatter portion of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| that would fall within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3976)|

| 1:06:20| residential for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| All right, that's all I have. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Commissioner Midas, did you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| No, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| with Commissioner Uten. I appreciate his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| comments. I, in just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| looking at this lower piece of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| I'm kind of questioning how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| do you have to have a grading permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| to start grading? It sounds like there's already been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| some grading taking place on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| And where exactly would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| you be developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| on that lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| it's a question for the applicant. Yeah, it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| northern, it's the northern parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| between Valgrove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| is on one, kind of comes right in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| right in there, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| the other piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| the one, because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| kind of looking at two pieces of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| property, right? The one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| the south piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Where would you be developing on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| Not at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| That's not our goal, no. Okay, and there hasn't been any grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| on that piece of property then? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| And there's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| some preliminary discussions, we not had those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| I mean, came too late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| that we would probably just dedicate that to something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| We're not sure if that's to a park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| a community park type thing, or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| it is. But again, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| economical to go in there and do too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| And you asked a question about grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| and again, I don't want to put the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| Knox County, but they have been up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| us two or three times and have determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| that what we were doing was not considered grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| We were clearing some finch rows out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| taking undergrowth brush and a lot of different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| like that out, cleaning the property up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| that had gotten overgrown in the front part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| You have two pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| here, 164 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| and one approximately 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| They ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| it all be zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| where, I'm jumping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| down to the zoning now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| So if it's planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| residential, the whole thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4116)|
| 1:08:38| the 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| one unit per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| acre can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| transferred to the 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| So we're not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Then we're talking about four and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| half units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| the only reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| in my mind, the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| reason that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| postponed last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| was so they could get four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| units to the acre, and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| do that, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| had to add the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| 95 acres. They picked up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| 95 more lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| instead of being, if they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| looking at 247,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| they could put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| 287| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| approximately on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| which figures out at about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| four and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| That,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| if you want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| being out of character with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| neighborhood, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| almost takes attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| housing to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| four and a half to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| And I'll let it go at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| recognizes Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| This definitely seems like a lot, and I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| with a lot of the comments that have been made so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| and still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| accumulating some thoughts, but I do have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| for the Opposition's Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| neighbors are hoping for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| other than just a complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| nothing happening, or is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| fewer units to the acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| Is there anything like that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| you've heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| Of course, the first and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| foremost wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| of the community surrounding this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| is nothing happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| My clients have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| attempted communication and had one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| on-site meeting, I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| with one or two of the members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| of the LLC, and they've also talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| with some of the people that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| out on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| We received an email telling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| us to quit communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| with them, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| that was it, and that's a kind way of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| putting it, directly from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| of the main members of the LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| who I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| point out is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| But they wanted to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| some of the things of screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| or things around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| industrial area, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I think that what we're not looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| here, importantly, is a topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| show you what people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| actually seeing in and around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| where they live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| I specifically wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| to know if there's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| But they met to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| about some of those issues after the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| trees and things came down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| so they would like to reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| out, they would like to have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| opportunity to sit down, but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| we received an email that said don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| contact us, so of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| we have to follow that, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Mr. Campbell will be happy to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Absolutely would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| I know my clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| would, and I know that the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| of the residents in the area would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| as well. Well, and I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| the idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| if there's a lot of opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| that that's a really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| to try to come up with something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| could be mutually acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| I will say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| to some of the other comments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| we've discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| said something about this not seeming like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| it was very agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| or rural and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| I have to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| I know that this highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| does have a lot of commercial on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| but I think this area, I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| if you zoom out on the map, it's just green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| So I agree with what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| Commissioner Graf said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| I do think that what we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| right now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| quite out of character for this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| and I also think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| lot to bite off at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| for this area. I think smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| steps of growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| may be more appropriate, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| that right now this is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| huge for the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| area. Thanks. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| Thanks, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| And I want to say that I do appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| people that came out today to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| about this case and talk about how it affects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| how they perceive it affects their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I would like to remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| that there is a zoning on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| now. There's agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| there's CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| there's CB, there's RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| And absolutely nothing that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| whatever we do today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| does not prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| this private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| owner from developing that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| There are certain things that can be built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| these zones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| probably be more deleterious than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| subdivision, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| my opinion. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| have a right to develop this property under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| these zones. There are certain things that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| be built out there without coming to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| without asking permission from any of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| from this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| I guess what I'm trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| is be careful what you ask for because there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| certain things now that can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| that would be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| undesirable, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| for your purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| And I'd also like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| to ask Commissioner Uten if he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| expand on why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| and what your thoughts are on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| reducing the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Commissioner Uten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Well, what I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| in addition to that is speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Commissioner Smith's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| comments about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| sector plan changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| And I guess I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| I might be overthinking this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| but I'm trying to be a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| defensive with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| what somebody ultimately could be doing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| this property. So if we left it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| I'd want to get it zoned planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| number one on the larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| track. I wouldn't want to limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| I wouldn't want to say, to Mr. Graff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| point, I still want to limit the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| but I don't want to leave that agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| where somebody could go up there and cut off one acre lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| and mess up that mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| or do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| I would want to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| put a planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| envelope over that whole thing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| it has to come back to us. We have a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| more teeth where we can tackle this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| big piece of property. So that's my first comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| Second comment in changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| that underlying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| sector plan is we get rid of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| the CB and the CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| and some of these other things. It cleans that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| So I'm leaning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| doing the sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| to the LDR as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| And I would be leaning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| not necessarily dividing the acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| up into ones or twos, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| think what I'd want to do, and we did this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| if Commissioner remembers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| some of the commissioners weren't on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| when we did this, but there was a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| over on Beverly Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| Very steep piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Had some floodway, had some railroad track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| issues, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| it probably needed to get developed at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| And we limited the number of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| units on that track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Specific number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| And I even recall the gentleman came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| and it seems to me like it was 102| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| units we approved and he came back and asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| 107 or something. And he had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| show us a plan. I think Mr. Graff was involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| in where that plan would be and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I thought that made sense based on the flatness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| of the part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| So I want to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| that path and if it's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| with the commission, I'd like to go ahead and make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| that we approve the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| per staff recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| LDR and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| We have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| and a second before we go to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| I just have a question about what Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| was saying and I want to make sure I'm reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| the map correctly. You were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| saying that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| not just agriculture, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| you said CA, CB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| and you mentioned another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| I see a little corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| of CA, but that's the only thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| I see other than agriculture. Where are you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| getting the other? I was reading from the present plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| designation. There's CB up where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| mouse is moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Yeah, CA and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| The CA is the pump station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4654)|
| 1:17:44| My point was to simply say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| there's certainly a lot of things that can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| and even if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| turn this down today, that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| not stop development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| There are certain things under the zone that's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| there that can be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| Commissioner Uten's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| statement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| Are you suggesting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| we limit the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| to the 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| although we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| giving the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| 95 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| one to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| but that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4714)|
| 1:18:36| all the development will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| on the 64 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| When I get to the point to make that motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| I think I'll explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Now I think we're on the sector plan, but yes, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| that's what I would be doing. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Commissioner Uten, if I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| be clear, you're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| be approved per staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| for both parcels, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| So that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| The residential on the 95 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| and the LDR on the 64 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| Correct. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| my purpose of that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| because of the changes in conditions, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| and even number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| one, trends in development, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| I just don't want any more property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| out there getting rezoned to industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| I just want to make sure. That's what I was going to ask, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| That's going to be LDR on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| flat piece, and then it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| you're still rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| residential and hillside protection on the 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| acres. Is that what your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| is? Correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| And that was my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Okay. We have a motion by Commissioner Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| seconded by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| to approve the sector plan per staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| recommendation. All in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| of the motion say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4791)|
| 1:19:53| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| And then I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| that we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| up to two and a half| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| on the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| I guess it would be one on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| other piece, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| would be a total of 255| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| units, and I want to specifically say 255| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| units, not just the acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| And I also want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| the rest of it is per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| meaning the parcel numbers and the acreages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| and such, but subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| to concentrating the density on the flatter portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| of the approved parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| as the applicant stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| So there's a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| Commissioner Uten, seconded by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| to approve PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| planned residential zoning up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| 2.5 dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| on the 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| approve the PR planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| on the 95 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| up to one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| So just for clarification purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| applicant would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| eligible up to 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| I think what I would want to do instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| of making that muddy is just say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| that the total property can only be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| developed at 255 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| total and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| that that would be subject to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| units being located on the flatter portions of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| property on the northern track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| So that includes maximum of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| 255 units on the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| You heard the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4895)|
| 1:21:39| I'm not following that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| because it sounded like what Commissioner Uten said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| was he wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| it's in discussion with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| right now. Please hold your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| That he wanted to limit the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| on the 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| which is the flat part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4915)|
| 1:21:57| to 2.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| but then there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| no, you're saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| What he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| proposing is that we calculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| density based on up to 2.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4929)|

| 1:22:13| which is the flat and then one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| unit per acre on the 95 which is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| hillside and the understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| is that all that topographically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| challenged wooded hillside area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| to be left undisturbed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| the total of this density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| be allowed to go forward on the flatter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| To say it another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| to say it another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| it is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| truly limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| the development to 2.5 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| on the flat portion. It is allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| If you think about it like the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| 2.5 times 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| and one unit an acre times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| the 95 that totals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| approximately 255 which Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| has limited the overall units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| to 255. Yeah so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Commissioner what I was trying to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| that's the way staff presented this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| They presented it as three per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| on the 64 acres and one per the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| on the 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| So all I was trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| was follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| but I wanted to further clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| that it just didn't give them the ability to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| and put 95 units on that big piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| I wanted the planned residential zone overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5003)|
| 1:23:25| on it so we could make sure they're not going to develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| because they've got to come back for a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| plan to shift that density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| as Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| That's four per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| That's four per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| It's more than the residential. Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Four per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Let us discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| this. That's exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| what I was wanting to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| is we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| approving four per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| on the 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| That's what it's going to build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| to. It may not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| how we're approving it but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| that's what it is. But if you look at it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| it's zero per acre on the 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| So you can't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| I mean it's a total of probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Because they're going to transfer it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| But why are they doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| Because they can't develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Because it's rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| You're preserving all the woods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| and all the hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Yeah and you're putting them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| at four per acre on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| developable part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| And last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| when that's what they asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| for staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| And they asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| for a postponement and came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| and submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| this so they could get four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| So they could raise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| So you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| recommendation on this was three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5093)|
| 1:24:55| and one. Chris cut it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| from three to two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| But last month when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| they had the 64 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| in there they were asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| for four. Staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Now with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| 95 additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5113)|
| 1:25:17| our motion is two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| But when you add in the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| lots it comes up it's still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5123)|
| 1:25:31| Commissioner Adams your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| It is. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5133)|
| 1:25:37| The proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| that staff has made and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| Commissioner Uten has modified slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| When you think about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| just in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| what we're looking at on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| In a total vacuum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| Wow this sounds like okay this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5153)|
| 1:25:55| making sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| But when you get out of that vacuum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| and you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| what Commissioner Graf is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| that there would be actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| four units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Even though you're saving this hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| what you've done is create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| this fairly sizable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| area that is now developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| at four per acre. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| next development that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| it's looked at what's in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| Oh look we've got four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| per acre here. We don't go back and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| that's why it's that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| We just look at it and say well there are four per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| acre. So we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| should probably let another one come in at four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| per acre. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| that's why I'm not going to be comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| I very much appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| the workings that staff has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| and that Commissioner Uten has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| structured but I'm just uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| with what that ultimately looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| for that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Thank you Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Chair recognizes Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you. I think everybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| if you look at the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| 64 acres times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| three plus the 95 is 287| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| homes. That's what staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| has recommended. What Chris has proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| is 32 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5227)|
| 1:27:09| less grand total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| than what even staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| if we go with the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| recommendation. So that's why I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| support what Chris has proposed which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| a maximum of 255| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| on the flat. We're not going to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| anything to be developed on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| 95 acres up top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5245)|

| 1:27:29| it has to come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| They can't just go up there and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| We have say in that so we can protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| the hillside. I think it's a win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| win to make sure that something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| doesn't happen up there that none of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| want that the community doesn't want on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| 95 acres. It keeps it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| pristine undisturbed but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| allow the developer to have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| property back that he could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| in that calculation but he's getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| less under Chris's proposal than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| staff was going to allow by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5275)|
| 1:27:57| 32 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| No because what it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| is they can't build on the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| 7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5283)|
| 1:28:11| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| Salsho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| I agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| with Commissioner Adams that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| it would be too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| dense in the 64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| I think we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| go with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5307)|
| 1:28:29| recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5309)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| I want to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| what Commissioner Smith had to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| as I'm sitting here listening to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| I agree with Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| He has given less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| density on the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| property and protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| the slopes and protecting the 95| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| acres from development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| At the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| with this change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| anything that's done out there has to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| back to this commission for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| I can tell you right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| they came back with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| any development on the 95 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| we're not going to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| And I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| the owner knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| That would be the sole purpose in the proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| that Chris has made in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| And the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| thing is I want to say again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5365)|
| 1:29:27| no matter what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| do there's things that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| be developed on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5371)|
| 1:29:33| right now that we have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| control over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| No control at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| They can go out there and they can build in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| CA. There's things that can be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| by right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| In agricultural they have a right to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| Theoretically they could go in there and cut that whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| hillside all to pieces and put one unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| per acre out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| And none of us want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| None of us want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| I just want to make those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5401)|
| 1:30:03| points. It could be a disaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| the way it's zoned right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| I have a question for Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| So under low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| what dwelling per unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| is usually acceptable during that range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| Well it would also go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5423)|
| 1:30:25| to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| And so the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5427)|
| 1:30:29| generally that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| could be permitted by the growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5433)|
| 1:30:35| is up to three dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| units an acre in the rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| Okay. And for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| the hillside protection plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| for this, just this piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| property, it recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| three and a half? Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| It recommended, because I was just looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Is it three and a half or did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| recommend four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| The hillside? The slope analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| Yeah, the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| If we look at page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| let's see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5469)|
| 1:31:13| five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| six actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Page six and seven are the two slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| analyses that are with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| hillside plan. So on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| 64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| acre area, the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| analysis yielded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| 2.83| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Staff recommended three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5495)|
| 1:31:37| On| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| the 95 acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| portion of the site with the significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| slope groups, the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| yielded 0.81| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| So to get three dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| units per acre on this piece, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| would have to be at 190| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5517)|
| 1:31:59| units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| which piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| are you talking about? Just the lower piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| that we're talking about. The 64 acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5527)|
| 1:32:13| The 64 acre area, if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5533)|
| 1:32:15| were up to 2.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| it would yield 160| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| Sorry, 160 total units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| Thank you. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| 95 acre area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| would yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| an additional 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| So the total would be 255.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| I guess another option you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| look at might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| planned residential over the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5561)|
| 1:32:43| thing at 1.6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| dwelling units an acre, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| the very steep sloped area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| And that would yield also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| 255 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| Commissioner Eddie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| Smith. And I just want to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| everyone, if you vote against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Chris's recommendation and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| vote with what staff recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| there's no protection for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| that 95 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5593)|
| 1:33:15| under the staff recommendation. They can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| build up there. So just understand if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| vote against what Chris has proposed, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| not protecting the 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| Is that necessarily the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Or wouldn't that just be a vote against that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Like if the motion were revised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| You would have to bring another motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5615)|

| 1:33:41| against that, just understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| anything we do after that, you've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5623)|

| 1:33:55| state your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5637)|

| 1:36:34| Proposed density, five dwelling units per acre. Staff recommendation, approve RA low density residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5794)|
| 1:36:43| because it is consistent with the sector plan designation of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5803)|
| 1:36:52| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5812)|

| 1:37:05| I just want to say I appreciate you didn't let me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| Well, you know, we would have, but somebody spent a little too extra long time talking, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5828)|
| 1:37:13| I guess you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| I don't have necessarily opposition. I am a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5841)|
| 1:37:22| I'm a homeowner on the street. I had a clarification I wanted to ask to see if I had an opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| Sir, if you could come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5847)|
| 1:37:28| Can you come up to the podium, please? Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| Eric Arnold. I live at 3954 Gordon Smith Road at the end of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| I'm not sure that I have an opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| I had a couple of questions I want a clarification, maybe from Mr. Campbell or the chair or the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5857)|
| 1:37:43| If this if this well, can I speak now or should I step back and be called upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| Mr. Campbell, do you want him to go ahead? Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| We went to high school together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| So question is, if we if if the committee does nothing to approve this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| I had a couple of concerns and I've talked to some other folks today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| And I just want to clarify that this property, if not approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| what would the density be if they were to put a RV park or a trailer home park in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| Does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| Miss Albertson is on this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| Do you want to speak? Respond to that, Liz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| The present zoning on the property is agricultural and it allows development of one house or one dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5904)|
| 1:38:32| A permanent dwelling. But what about a mobile home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| Or if he were to put an RV park with 20 slips in there, could that pass and go through without approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5914)|
| 1:38:40| The density for mobile homes, to my understanding, is viewed the same as a dwelling unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| What about an RV park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| So could you put I mean, I don't I don't I guess I'm not really quite sure what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5929)|
| 1:38:59| There's about one acre there. So you could put about one mobile home there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| Right. So but not a mobile home, but like an RV park where he could store and park RV facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| Could that be done under the current zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| Is that a loophole in the zoning that that could be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| I don't believe so. But I don't know if anybody here from Knox County Codes is available to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| Here's Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| Steve Elliott, 205 West Baxter, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| The only storage that's allowed in the Ag Zone is indoor storage so that they would have to come through for a use on review for indoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5970)|
| 1:39:37| So there would be no RVs allowed and RV parks aren't allowed in the Ag Zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| So I would just finish up and say that I would only be in opposition if this was not a low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5983)|
| 1:39:51| So my opinion is that our properties on the street are typically one home per acre or larger in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5991)|
| 1:39:58| And I would recommend that this be approved for residential but to be withheld to just to two units per the property, not five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=5998)|
| 1:40:07| Because I don't feel like that helps our neighborhood and our road already struggles with traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| And I don't know that we want to add five homes in that little area right there trying to pull out on Norse Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| You know, the staff's recommendations are a low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6020)|
| 1:40:24| Liz, that's how many homes could be put on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| It would be subject also to meeting all the other standards required by the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6030)|
| 1:40:37| But 10,000 square foot lots, if sewer is provided, are permitted under the RA Zone District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6037)|
| 1:40:46| So if it's slightly over an acre in size, then maybe potentially four to five could go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6046)|
| 1:40:56| But that might be challenging given, you know, the width of the lot as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| And excuse me, it says density proposed up to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| Do you see I'm proposing up to two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| Because I don't I can this be approved up to two is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6069)|
| 1:41:15| I would be fine with two homes at the end of our street for homeowners or even a rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| Because Jason builds nice properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| I mean, he's done a good job in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| They're in asset halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| But I just don't see five pieces of property or five units being put on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6084)|
| 1:41:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| That's just my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| So we're OK with staff recommendation to RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Our goal is three, maybe four, but probably more like three unit, three dwellings that would be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| They'll be single family homes is what we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| And we couldn't get up to five anyway without going to PR zoning because 10,000 times five is 50,000, which is more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| And with setbacks and all that, it would just be almost impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| So we're and I think when we get to five, we start getting into detention and some other things that we don't want to do for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6123)|
| 1:42:12| So we're just looking at our zoning, 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| We're right at the end of Gordon Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| And I know Eric's on the other end and we both drive this road a bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6138)|
| 1:42:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| Yeah, a lot of people do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| You got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| But I drive on the other end of Gordon Smith up through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| But it's it's something that we think staff RA helps us get to about that three units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6151)|
| 1:42:39| which looks very comfortable on this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| If you look at the existing structures that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| Chair recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| We approve our a low density residential zoning because it's consistent with the sector plan designation for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Motion is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Chair will recognize Commissioner Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| One comment on our zoning isn't aren't the streets deducted from the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6183)|
| 1:43:11| So he's right about it in PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6191)|
| 1:43:16| You take the whole area in our a you deduct the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| It may be an acre, but it's really less than an acre because you take the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| And I think also if we do an access easement, which we may do that, I think that acreage is also deducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6210)|
| 1:43:35| So same same kind of principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| So we have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve our a low density residential first dash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6219)|
| 1:43:47| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| Item 14 has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| Postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| On the item number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| This is a rezoning item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Applicant is safe harbor residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| And this will be shown for the record that commissioner will be recusing himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| File 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| I 21 R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| Location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| South side of Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| East of East Gallagher Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| Track size is 131.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6267)|
| 1:44:31| Present zoning is a agricultural zoning requested planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| Proposed density up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6277)|
| 1:44:41| Staff recommendation is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| P.R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Planned residential zoning up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6284)|
| 1:44:48| Because it is consistent with the northwest county sector plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6288)|
| 1:44:54| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Ben Mullen's 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| Mr. Mullen, I know you have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6300)|
| 1:45:02| Would you like to go first or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| I'll start off briefly and then reserve any time for rebuttal if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I appreciate staff's recommendation for two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| Because it's consistent with the sector plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6318)|
| 1:45:22| As set forth in the letter I sent you guys, the three units per acre is also consistent with the sector plan and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6322)|
| 1:45:30| And we'll talk about that a little bit more later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| But what I wanted to say is this property has been owned by the Brown family since the mid-1800s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| They've carefully considered who they wanted to sell this property to and what piece of the property they wanted to sell first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6338)|
| 1:45:46| This is only a portion, 131 acres, of a larger overall tract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| And there will be other opportunities for the balance of this tract in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| And maybe even at that point we'll have some updated sector plans and growth policy plans to kind of deal with some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6357)|
| 1:46:05| that we're going to talk about today that we struggle with for this kind of property, especially in the Hardin Valley area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| But today we're looking at the standards that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| And in looking at the comments in opposition, there's this overarching theme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| that somehow this development isn't in compliance with the growth policy plan or the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| And that just is plain not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| You know, during the agenda review there were some questions of whether we met the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| and the allowance of an extension of up to three dwelling units an acre within the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6393)|
| 1:46:39| And that came up a little bit in the Thunderhead Road development before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| because there's four factors that you have to meet before you can go to three dwelling units an acre in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6404)|
| 1:46:53| Which is what we're asking here. We're not asking for any sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| One isn't required here for three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| And the four factors are it has to be zone planned residential, which is what we're doing here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6420)|
| 1:47:06| There has to be provision of sanitary sewer and public water services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| which we have evidence from West Knox Utility District that it can provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6430)|
| 1:47:18| There has to be streets that meet the Knox County Engineering and Public Works standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| And there are improvements that we are working with the county to do to widen Couch Mill Road to meet those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6443)|
| 1:47:32| and to improve the intersection of Couch Mill and Steele to help deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| And also this is a parental responsibility zone. We'll have to do a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| County is asking us to, instead of putting along the frontage, to actually move that between the property and the intersection of Steele Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| which I think we would be willing to do that as well. We have to build the sidewalk anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| And then finally, there has to be a traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| which shows that it will not unreasonably impair traffic flow along the roads to the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| The planned growth area here is about 1,500. It's actually at the intersection of Steele Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6481)|
| 1:48:06| And our traffic impact analysis does conclude that with the improvements that we are prepared to make, we would meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6486)|
| 1:48:14| So all of the requirements of 3.5 in the growth policy plan are met here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| and that allows consideration of not just the two, which is normally limited for the rural area, but for the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| So that's what we're asking for here today. I know there's some other concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| There's a lot of growth in Hardin Valley, and I appreciate those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| And I've talked to Kim several times about this, and we've met about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| And I think there's more conversations that we can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| But for right now, I'd like to reserve the remaining bit of my time and listen to what Ms. Frazier and anybody else may have to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6522)|
| 1:48:49| and see if we can talk about that some more today. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| Ms. Frazier, we've got seven individuals who have signed to speak on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| Are you representing some of them or any of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| I'm representing some of them, but we would ask for the same consideration given to the earlier groups for an extended period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| if you all would consider that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| Is there any opposition to adding an additional five minutes to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6552)|
| 1:49:18| All right, so we'll give both parties a total of ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| And, again, be cognizant of others who are going to speak and don't use up 90 percent of the time, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| Ms. Frazier, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| Kim Frazier, 11835 Couch Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Thank you, planning staff and this opportunity to address you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6576)|
| 1:49:41| I also want to thank Ben Mullins and David Harbin for their willingness to come to the table and have some really thoughtful dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| I appreciate the task that's put before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| I know this is difficult. It's difficult for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| Commission, I have many questions and points that I would like for you to consider today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| How does this development add value to this community beyond housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| Aren't the intentions of the sector plan to identify the best use of land in a geographic area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| Isn't a better land use decision to uphold the ag zoning until our community's infrastructure and services reach a healthy level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6607)|
| 1:50:15| Why are rezonings and sector plan amendments the new norm rather than the exception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| Does this request move us forward as a community or does it make existing problems worse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6622)|
| 1:50:28| I've been attending land use meetings for almost seven years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| I continue to show up because I believe that we can improve our processes and approaches to making decisions that impact our citizens' daily lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6632)|
| 1:50:40| And I also believe that we have an administration, county department leaders, and staff members who also agree that it is important to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6640)|
| 1:50:47| is what we are doing and how we are doing it working for our citizens, our county, its growth, and its economy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6647)|
| 1:50:56| The Hardin Valley community is not sure that this decision to rezone this property to PR at two or three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| helps us approach land use that is working for our residents, the business owners, or our educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6663)|
| 1:51:11| I believe the county has made an incredible commitment under Mayor Jacobs' leadership to do something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| and bring everyone to the table to create a comprehensive land use, transportation, and park plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6676)|
| 1:51:21| that will look only, not look only where we want to go, but how we want to get there and the processes that are needed to get us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6681)|
| 1:51:31| But it's going to take time and it's going to take tremendous effort from all stakeholders, including our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6691)|
| 1:51:40| And so with that, on behalf of the Hardin Valley community and so many other communities countywide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6700)|
| 1:51:46| I have an ask that I would like for you to consider so that we all, all of us, citizens, planning commission, county commission, planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6706)|
| 1:51:53| we can be unified in our approach to land use during the creation and implementation of this new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6713)|
| 1:52:02| My ask for you to decide here today is to adhere to the land use plans and recommended zonings identified in the 12 sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6722)|
| 1:52:09| The sector plans have a lot of great concepts and initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| The biggest challenge has been making those ideals realities and implementing the identified projects and development patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6732)|
| 1:52:20| Until the comp plan is complete, it only makes sense for decision makers to lean into the sector plans for guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| We are here today to respectfully ask this body to preserve the collective acknowledgement of planning professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6747)|
| 1:52:34| county officials, county departments, school system, business leaders, and community leaders and citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| to the designation of this property as rural residential and use the recommended zoning in the 2016 Northwest Sector Plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6760)|
| 1:52:49| the county's most recent plan, which are the standards that are in place that Mr. Mullins referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6769)|
| 1:52:56| In the Northwest Sector Plan, under rural residential land use classification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| the recommended zoning in the current county's rural area are open space, estate, planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| at densities of one dwelling unit if dwellings are clustered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6784)|
| 1:53:10| I'm not going to go into a lot of detail there because I expect you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| Other zonings to consider include ag or PR up to three if dwellings are clustered in one portion of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6795)|
| 1:53:24| We have to admit this looks a little strange, but the recognition of one acre allowing consideration of up to three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| so we respectfully ask you to uphold the sector plan recommending one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| But if you choose to deliberate the other zonings with greater than allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6814)|
| 1:53:42| I ask you what you should consider to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6822)|

| 1:55:13| In fact, our community has no place to gather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| The community center was condemned, demolished, and the athletic fields used by our youth sports were closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=6917)|

| 1:57:10| So the forthcoming comp plan will take all of this into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| along with all the needs and the visions of every sector plan, and every study, and every plan that the county has ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7034)|
| 1:57:21| So I'm asking you to look at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| Our county's leadership has recognized that the decades of decisions made regarding land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| have had adverse effects on our communities, and our roadways, and our schools, and our economy, and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7049)|
| 1:57:35| So please ask yourself today, how can your service on this commission begin the reshaping of our county's approach to growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7055)|
| 1:57:42| and more sustainable and more responsible land use decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7062)|
| 1:57:46| Now, today matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| Today matters more than you can imagine, and it begins with the following recommendations of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| I again ask you, you have an incredible opportunity to begin reshaping how we invest in our people and our places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7075)|
| 1:58:02| and prepare for the changes that will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| And it starts with this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| How we grow matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| What I'm asking you is not unreasonable, it's just uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| Please lean in to discomfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| Penny Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7100)|
| 1:58:31| Before we proceed, we've got Norm Anderson, is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7111)|
| 1:58:38| Martha Arnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| Mark Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| And Rodney Griffin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7125)|
| 1:58:47| Are all of you wanting to speak as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7127)|
| 1:58:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7134)|
| 1:59:00| Just so that we can avoid what happened a little while ago, can I make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7140)|
| 1:59:04| that we give each speaker one minute on the clock so that they know when their time is up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7144)|
| 1:59:09| You know that, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7149)|
| 1:59:14| Yeah, one minute's pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| Well, that'd be five minutes for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| And this is why we bring it up, because there are a lot of people in the room that take off time from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7160)|
| 1:59:25| And when we try to limit the amount of time that people speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| they can get in and out of here a lot quicker and get back to their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| And that's why we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| We don't do it to hold you all from speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| But we do request that you be consistent and understand that others want to speak as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| So if you use up nine minutes of a ten-minute talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| then it gets a little difficult for those who want to speak to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| And then we look like we don't care because we're limiting them the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-211209?start=7193)|
