| 0:04:23| That's what she told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| I looked on the camera and can't deny it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=264)|

| 0:05:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| Sorry, a presumption on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=316)|

| 0:05:45| Mr. Best, you saw the procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| I will be calling Chief May to bring the allegations before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| after which you will have an opportunity to affirm or deny and give your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| On March 15, 2018, purchased one can Bud Light beer at the Speedway on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=360)|

| 0:06:17| Mr. Best, do you affirm or deny the allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Anything you would like to testify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I just want to let you know what we do for training to prevent these type of incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| We go through our computer-based training, which is interactive with our new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| And they also do not get on the register for three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| They observe the register operations and do other duties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| I do have the printout here if anybody would like to see that training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| We also have an internal compliance program where every store is shopped monthly for alcohol compliance and also tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=402)|
| 0:06:51| They receive a green card or a red card, whether they pass or fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| And we also have on February 12 that we did pass a Tennessee Department of Agriculture for tobacco and vapor products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=416)|
| 0:07:05| So we do take it serious as far as being a corporate citizen and making sure we obey by the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| And unfortunately, when the gentleman asked for the ID, the policy is to scan in the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=432)|
| 0:07:20| but he pushed in the birth date and it was apparently wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| Sir, what we do on first offense is offer a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=450)|
| 0:07:41| You know, it seems a little harsh at times, but we've had experience that the $500 didn't really matter to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| And it seems to be that the $1,000 doesn't matter to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| because there's 14 people here in prom season the last two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| So I want to make a motion that we offer them the option for a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Sir, which do you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| Pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| Mr. Best, you have seven days to pay the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=499)|

| 0:09:26| Actually, we have a zero tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| If anything goes like that and somebody violates anything, so we always let the cashier go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=574)|

| 0:09:44| As we normally do, I suggest a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Can I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Before us, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Would you make that a motion, not a suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=602)|

| 0:10:14| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Sir, which would you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=615)|

| 0:11:09| I'll call Chief May at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=669)|
| 0:11:18| On March 14, 2018, purchased 25-ounce Bud Light can, Food City, 7350 Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=678)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Mr. Higginbotham, do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| This is your opportunity to tell the board anything on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| We take it very serious, and we met with the associate that done the underage felt sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| He was terminated immediately as part of our zero tolerance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| I have a packet put together here to talk about some of our training programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| The first thing we do is we meet with each and every associate during new hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| and once a year to review the Knott's County Beer Law Acknowledgement Form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| We review state law regarding the sale of regulated items with a form of an employment of understanding with each associate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| We enroll the associates into the tips and wine certification classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| We run those course classes schedules each month and enroll them in the immediate future of the next 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| We perform in-house monthly stings using people 21 to 23 years of age to attempt to purchase alcohol and or tobacco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| Failure to comply with that properly entering the correct ID will result in immediate termination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| Food City has also added a secondary function to our registers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| making sure that the cashier confirms and has to enter their birth date twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| and that way they can't use the reason that they misread it, and we train those appropriately each and every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| And then at the end, the store manager reviews all paperwork after the HRC does their part of the orientation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| We met with each individual associate in our entire store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Immediately thereafter, they failed sting on March 14th, revisited the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| and we do that weekly to make sure everybody is a part of the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| and everybody understands the severity of the issue that we did fail the sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=774)|

| 0:13:17| It sometimes bothers me that these things happen, but you will have a fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| and I make a motion that we have a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| I have a proper motion. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=811)|

| 0:14:35| Affirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| This is your opportunity to tell this board anything you wish for them to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=876)|

| 0:15:22| but I wanted you all to see what we try to do with our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| We train about 400 employees a year out of the 220, roughly, positions that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=925)|
| 0:15:31| This is a new store that's been open right at a year today, two or three days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| It's right at a year of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| We fail to steam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| We have our employees, Sandy Kirkpatrick is our trainer back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Sandy, stand up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| She is our trainer and has been for 21 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| And all of our employees go through corporate training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| The Tennessee ID, which is an online training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| as well as our National Association of Convenience Stores tobacco and alcohol management training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| the day they're hired before they ever set foot in the store to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| The next thing is our tobacco and alcohol policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| and those are gone through with the employees at the time of hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and then they're also reiterated monthly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| and you can see the signatures on the pages for Easy Stop number 30 there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| Like our other compatriots in the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| we have a mystery shop survey that's done by a third-party firm outside our corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| monthly to check for beer and cigarette stings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| If that employee fails to steam, then they're brought back for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| If they fail our mystery shops the second time, they're terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Due to the requirements of our beer permit, the employee that was fined at Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| was terminated immediately upon receipt of her citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| because our rules say that nobody with a crime of moral turpitude in 10 years can work for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| and so we take that seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| That's what we try to do to prevent sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| The cashier looked at the ID and ignored the age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1031)|
| 0:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1038)|

| 0:17:29| and I appreciate what you and all the other vendors have tried to do to prevent that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| but there's human error, but it's a serious human error, and we have to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| I'll make a motion that it's a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1061)|

| 0:18:25| and it's pretty much a battle with your employees to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| the way you train them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1109)|

| 0:18:41| But we all, we don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1121)|

| 0:21:03| Chief May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1263)|
| 0:21:09| On March 15, 2018, I sent an underage person into 1116 Harvey Road and purchased a can of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1269)|
| 0:21:22| Ms. Reagan, do you affirm or deny the allegations presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| Affirm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Affirm, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| This is an opportunity for you all to present any facts you would like for this body to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| I would like you to know that we do do online training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| I just wanted you to know we do do the online training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Everybody gets trained once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| I think this was just a mistake by a young boy that just turned 21 himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1303)|
| 0:21:51| I'd like to add we also have a person on staff who actually couldn't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| She planned on it, who deals with nothing but alcohol compliance and ensuring that our company does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| I believe this is the first time in three years that this location has, you know, ever had an issue related to alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1322)|
| 0:22:10| So, you know, we would just ask that you be lenient, if possible, in regards to the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| I guess what's troubling for me, Ms. Reagan and Mr. Berg, is that your store location is completely surrounded by residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1342)|
| 0:22:31| This is not on a commercial corridor like Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| So the people that are, you know, accessing your store are just the local neighbors within a mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| And so what bothers me is as many kids that live in Montgomery Cove and Mallard Bay and those subdivisions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| we don't want this to be an issue where they think, okay, we can run down to the neighborhood store and get beer, even though we're only 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1371)|
| 0:23:01| So I'll make a motion for a $1,000 fine or a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Sir, which would you all choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| You have seven days to pay the clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you guys for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=1408)|

| 0:34:23| Mr. Hajjani, do you affirm or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Yeah, I totally agree on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Basically, it was a newest employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| We got it, and she was by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| We have the system to punch their IDs, check their IDs and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| At the first offense, we had it like two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| I think it was one and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| After that, we put that system, and we were doing best on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| But soon, what happened, there was a new employee working for us, and probably she just didn't check the ID, and she sold the beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| It's totally agreeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| It's a mistake from us, and I'll try my best to check all the IDs before we sell any beer to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| I totally agree we made a mistake on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2102)|

| 0:38:51| We now come to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| I have three people signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| First is Janice Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Ms. Clark, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2340)|
| 0:39:11| Ma'am, if you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Janice Clark, and I live on Pedigo Road, 9316 Pedigo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| I'm here regarding the naming of the bridge on Pedigo Road in Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| There was several problems that we felt like transpired during the naming of this bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| One was that nobody bothered to get the consents of the residents on Pedigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| The other one was that no one bothered to check the history of the bridge or the road on Pedigo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2380)|
| 0:39:47| And the other one was that Mary Lou Horner did not really serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| And I'm really kindly doubtful that she even was ever on our road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| I wanted to briefly tell you a little bit about our road, but I wanted to tell you about the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| and the community and the family that has lived on that road since 1822.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| My husband's family, his grandfather's name was Elijah Oscar Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2409)|
| 0:40:14| He was born in 1889 in the home place and lived there with his family there on Pedigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| And together they raised two sons, Eldred Owen Clark and Herman Lester Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| Elijah Oscar was known as E.O. Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| He was a school teacher and later became the principal of the old Green Hill Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| which is currently Copper Ridge on Brushy Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| He also taught in the Halls Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| And during his lifetime, he served as a justice of the peace, a constable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| He was a song leader for Pleasant Hill Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| He was an educator and a community leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| His son, Eldred Owen Clark, also known as E.O., married the love of his life, Martha Janeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| in the family home place in a double ceremony with his brother, Herman, and his bride, Willadeen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| which happens to be Sandra Clark's parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Eldred was a dairy farmer, sold milk to Avondale's in Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| then located where the Rural King is currently located, servicing Pedigo and the entire Knox County area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2477)|
| 0:41:25| His dairy was located there on the farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| And at their deaths, he and his wife were the longest-running Knox County school bus contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| They started their school buses in the early 1940s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| The original bridge on Pedigo Road was first built in the early part of 1919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| And until the bridge was built, the Pedigo community traveled the creek bed to get to the local post office in Gristmill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2505)|
| 0:41:53| The grandfather, E.O. Clark, petitioned at that time to have the first bridge built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2513)|
| 0:41:59| and actually gave the land to Knox County to put the bridge on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| There was no money exchanged hands. It was a gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| He gave it to him because it would help his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| That bridge was a wooden constructed bridge, and it fell in the fall of 1966 under the weight of a concrete truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| At that time, Eldred Owen Clark gave the county enough of his land to move that bridge over about 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2537)|
| 0:42:26| and to part of his road in front of his house so it would be a straighter passageway, easier access for his community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2546)|
| 0:42:34| And again, no money exchanged hands. He gave them the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2554)|
| 0:42:41| Today, Eldred's son, my husband, Estel Oscar Clark, also known as E.O., owns the old home place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2561)|
| 0:42:51| along with about 57 acres there on Pedigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| We own the property that's on either side of that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| So if you came to the dedication and you were standing there, you went from Fairhaven Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| and you pulled in that little graveled area there next to the bridge, you were standing on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| And as you looked out on both sides, you saw the cow pastures and the old home place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| That's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| So technically, I guess you were trespassing, I guess you might say, if you were on our property at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2596)|
| 0:43:25| Eldred, along with his brother Herman, proudly served their country in World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2605)|
| 0:43:31| Both served as deacons in their family home church at Pleasant Hill Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| They have a very long history of love of community, love of family, love of their heavenly father, faithful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| dedicated service to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| Mary Lou was all about beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| I work at Commercial Bank, and I remember many years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| when she wanted to plant about three dozen dogwood trees down the middle of Maynardville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| She loved flowers and blooming stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| And the county has saw fit to honor her by putting her name on a plaque in the middle of a cow pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| And I'm just going to tell you, that bridge is anything but beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| My husband and I have paid out of our pocket to purchase bolters to put along the creek bed to keep the bank from eroding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2653)|
| 0:44:23| When people get down under our bridge and they spray paint under the bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| and the local church wants to have a baptizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| my husband's the one that gets down under the bridge and cleans it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Because when we call Knox County and ask them if they can come and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| they tell us, no, it's private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| So we take care of that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| We're not asking for Mary Lou to be dishonored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| We're not asking for anything to be taken away from her at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| She was a wonderful woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| She did great things for her community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| We're just asking that she be honored in the community that she loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| and the community that she served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| And in so doing that, give the bridge the name that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| Name it after the family that actually gave the property in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| the family that's loved that farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Had Mary Lou's family, if that had been her family's property, I would have understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| If that's where she had grown up in the country with cows and horses, I would have understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| But to name a bridge in the middle of a cow pasture after a woman who was all about beautification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| just does not make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| And my suggestion to Mr. Bussler was to name it what it deserves to be, the Pettigo Road Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| But after talking with my neighbors, and I do have a petition here from the neighbors up and down Pettigo Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| and after talking with them, most of them commented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| we thought it was already called the Clark Bridge, that's what we've always known it as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| because most of the older ones knew my husband's family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| So after speaking with them, and upon their recommendation as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| I'd like to suggest that it be changed to the E.O. Clark Memorial Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| That way there will be three generations of Clarks who have actually worked and lived and loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2767)|
| 0:46:13| and done community service on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| And then give Mary Lou an honor out where it's beautiful and where it's going to be recognizable for her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| because that's what she, I've got a feeling she would probably be spinning in her grave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| if she thought that she was being honored in a cow pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| But that's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| But thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| When this came up and I started looking at it and started to find out how we could honor Mary Lou Horner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2802)|
| 0:46:52| without dishonoring her, taking her name down there, I got a lot of history on Mary Lou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| And one of the things she loved to do, especially in one of her areas that she covered as a commissioner, was Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| And she would plant a tree there with a plaque on it to honor someone who passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| And she was always about beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| We were talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| We discussed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Maybe in some way down the road we take a look at these honors before we bestow it on a bridge or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| about the individual and what they meant to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| So if we could do something around either the Fountain City Park or another area where we put up a plaque that stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2853)|
| 0:47:43| what Mary Lou was to Knox County would be much better than what she suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| And I'm not downgrading the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2871)|
| 0:47:53| It's a beautiful area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2873)|
| 0:47:55| But she said a little sign up in the middle of a cow pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| So we need to really take a look and see if there's different things that we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| especially to show what Mary Lou meant to the county like Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| I think at the time when they reorganized this, we had four areas that she cared for was Holston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| Shannondale, Fountain City, and Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| And not all the way Halls went all the way to the county line because District 8 came around that county line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2898)|
| 0:48:26| So I'm not suggesting or making a motion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| We need to look for a place to honor Mary Lou for what she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| And it was beautification, like Janice suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| So maybe we can take a look and discuss this at another time, what we can do for this honor for that lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Yes, I just wanted to reemphasize what Commissioner Boesler has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| As one that grew up with having Mary Lou Horner in her life from as early as I can remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2934)|
| 0:49:02| 7th District was Fountain City, which is where Mary Lou lived when she was elected the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2942)|
| 0:49:10| And I see Sandra out in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I'm sure you can back me up on this, but she lived on Thrawl when she was first elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| which is right by Fountain City ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2958)|
| 0:49:21| She loved Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| She raised Bobby in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And then later on she moved out into Halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| And I believe that was probably after Bobby had gotten married and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| So anyway, Mary Lou, and she also was a very faithful member of Central Baptist of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2975)|
| 0:49:44| So I don't know how the county made the decision, but the decision was already made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2984)|
| 0:49:52| I didn't have any input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| And at the time I kind of thought, hmm, that's kind of strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| Way out there, and I was at the dedication and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| And I just kind of, and this I hope no one takes this, the county, whoever made the decision, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3006)|
| 0:50:18| I don't know how the decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| But I have to say that that isn't, everybody that knew Mary Lou, our little redheaded fireball woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3021)|
| 0:50:32| was not bored and would never ever, I don't think, want to spend the day in the middle of a field by herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3032)|
| 0:50:45| She was a colorful person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| And so no offense to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| I mean, I think it's beautiful out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| I some days would love to be out there in the middle of that field by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| But I was concerned about not having anything really in more of the Fountain City area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3058)|
| 0:51:06| And as the years have gone on, the different redistricting of the districts, the drawing of that, it larger, it built out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3066)|
| 0:51:14| So I don't know what we do, but I do understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| And I hope no one is offended by any of this because none of us would ever do anything to ever take away from Mary Lou Horner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3081)|
| 0:51:29| She has helped make Knox County and has made a way for women to aspire to be as strong as she was on all that she did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3089)|
| 0:51:40| So further going, if we get a group or we have a discussion about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| I want everybody to know that I do want to be a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| and want to make sure that Mary Lou Horner's name and all of her hard work gets noticed by everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Ms. Clark, I think you're a great example of communities always know what's best for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| And I really appreciate everything your family has done for that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| and hear about your husband taking care of that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| As many people in this room back in the 70s and 80s, I think I talked to Mary Lou at least once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| And so I feel like I knew her very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| And she would not be upset by this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| She would be honored to have the honor wherever it may end up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| And I think that's just what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Make sure that we put it where her and her family would be honored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| and where the neighbors and the community there feels what's best for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| And I'm sure that we all can get together to make this work out right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| so that everybody is honored and also duly noted for everything they've done for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| And I hope we will get together and figure this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| Thank you. Very well said, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| Chelsea Beavis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3196)|
| 0:53:28| Chelsea Beavis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| Sue Hurling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| Is Sue Hurling here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3216)|
| 0:53:47| Okay. Madam Clerk, move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee, honoring Travis McKinney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| and from the occasion of his receipt of the Keller Williams Realty International Rookie of the Year Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| This is Resolution 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Would Travis McKinney please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| I would request that his family join with us at the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| and that we also be afforded the opportunity of former County Commissioner Jack Huddleston to join with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3261)|
| 0:54:29| I move that this resolution be approved and it be read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| With a proper motion and a second before us, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| And the motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Madam Clerk, will you please read the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| He did take that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| Whereas local entrepreneur and real estate agent Travis McKinney was recently named the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| Keller Williams Realty International Rookie of the Year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| which award is given to the agent with the most production in their first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| and whereas Travis McKinney had over $12 million in sales his first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| an accomplishment only a few agents maintain and attain after years of experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| whereas Travis McKinney has spent the last eight years as a real estate investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| and his company T&T Real Estate Investments has rejuvenated over 100 homes in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| thereby increasing home values all across neighborhoods in East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| and whereas Travis McKinney is also a state-certified appraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| and has been licensed for eight years, completing hundreds of appraisals for lenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| and whereas our community is fortunate that Travis McKinney decided to put his talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| and expertise to use by helping others buy, sell, and invest in real estate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3344)|
| 0:55:48| and whereas the Knox County Commission wishes to recognize Travis McKinney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| for his significant achievement with Keller Williams Realty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| now therefore be it resolved by the commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| The Knox County Commission hereby honors and congratulates Travis McKinney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| upon the occasion of his receipt of the Keller Williams Realty International Rookie of the Year Award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| and be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to Travis McKinney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| and be further resolved that this resolution take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3385)|
| 0:56:35| I've got the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| There's two things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| That's Keller Williams Realty International Rookie of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3400)|
| 0:56:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| That's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| And then probably pretty important to him is the sales, $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| This is an extreme accomplishment, and I congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| Well, I think that's, Dave, you just said it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| This is really, this is something that somebody from Knoxville, Tennessee, that did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| It was an international award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| This is not a state award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| It's not a local award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| I know when he flew to California, right, to accept the award, that it was a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| and we really should be pleased that he lives here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3447)|
| 0:57:36| Travis, I was just, when I was out in your neck of the woods, I was noticing all the signs up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3456)|
| 0:57:41| and I was concerned you were running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| But I have a proclamation very similar in nature, and I'll just give that to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| and thank you so much for what you do, and this is for you, not for your grandfather-in-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3469)|
| 0:58:01| I want to thank all of you all for this award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| It's just an honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| I love this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| I'll do anything I can to help out here, and my company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3486)|
| 0:58:10| we have rejuvenated houses all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| We love making each neighborhood better every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3492)|
| 0:58:14| and I love helping our clients find homes to raise their families in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| Just thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Thank you very much, Joyce and Jackie, and my family here, Emily and Adam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| I couldn't do it without them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3513)|

| 1:00:52| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| I have no items to be withdrawn this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Items to be deferred are item number one, number 72.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3661)|
| 1:01:09| Both those items are to June along with 3-A18SP and 3-D18RZ to be deferred to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3669)|
| 1:01:38| Did you say 84 and 85?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| I wanted to state something for the record on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| Go back and watch the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| I was not the one that called for the deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| They requested a deferment and I was the one that did a secondary motion that we defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| So just for the record, I wanted everybody to know that it was not Commissioner Carringer that asked to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| They actually asked for the deferment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| And you can go back and check the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| So I just wanted to put that on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| I did go back and watch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| The developer surveyor did ask for that and we moved on in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3737)|
| 1:02:24| And I would suggest, and this is one of the reasons why I want us to have rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| that if we make a deferral on behalf of the developer or the applicant, that we state that in our motion at the request and for in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3748)|
| 1:02:40| Can we have a motion and a second before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3762)|
| 1:02:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Can I have the following items not to be on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| Item 3, 4, 5, 62, 63, 70, and 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3775)|
| 1:03:04| Are there any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3784)|
| 1:03:17| Seeing no lights, do I have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Do you want to ask about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| I marked it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3811)|
| 1:03:40| Is it under procurement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| Keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| The property on Market Street where they're donating it to the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3826)|
| 1:03:53| Do you want to clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| It's right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| 61.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| No, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| No, they moved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3840)|
| 1:04:08| Let me get a motion on the deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| Back to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Did you guys figure out which item you wanted to pull off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| Okay, just a minute, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| I have 3, 4, 5, 62, 63, 70, and 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3869)|
| 1:04:34| How about 54?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Number 54?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| It's 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| I mean, the white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| It's 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| I think that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3883)|
| 1:04:53| Add 54 to that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| Okay, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3910)|
| 1:05:21| This is Drive Some Roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Number 3 is consideration of the closure of a portion of Twin Oak Lane as per the concept plan approved by MPC in May 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3923)|
| 1:05:32| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Mr. Chairman, I would move to defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Shooting from the hip at the work session, I may have said that if a property owner has both sides of the road leading toward a dead end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3946)|
| 1:05:57| which they control all of that, then the road might properly be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| But hearing an ownership issue of the road we're trying to close at the dump in south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3964)|
| 1:06:11| or the ownership of where the Clark Bridge may be and how it was given to Knox County or whether it was given to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3971)|
| 1:06:20| there may be a question in my mind about who owns the real estate that the asphalt is on as relates to Twin Oak Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3980)|
| 1:06:31| That precipitates my motion to defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| We have a Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| And that is along with the line of conversation that Commissioner Wright brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| Because we were supposed to do a notification to people by certified letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| and I just want to make sure as we move to close any roads that we follow up with a certified letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4009)|
| 1:06:55| And I'm not even sure if we have even looked at the property in south Knoxville or this property with appropriate notification with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4015)|
| 1:07:08| Okay, seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| Since Engineering and Public Works is here, do we want to just ascertain whether those notices have been sent or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4031)|
| 1:07:18| and still allow the deferral if they want to address it at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4038)|
| 1:07:24| And that's what's going to come in on because I've heard from people in the south Knoxville area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| that have not received their certified letter on the closure out there by the dump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| Jim Snowden, Knox County Engineering 205, West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| Yeah, it is our policy to always send certified letters and receive the return receipts back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| and try to make every effort to contact individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| In this particular case on Twin Oak, those were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| Edwards Place Development is one of the landowners, and Mr. Hibben is all the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| So those contacts have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| We have a motion, a proper motion and a second before us to defer until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4087)|

| 1:08:20| and 8518 Raindrop Road, approximately 1,500 linear feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4105)|

| 1:08:36| Number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| Do we have the same issue with this one, or are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| Have the notices been sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| I'll make a motion to approve this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| Once again, Engineering Public Works, all the paperwork is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| And I remember last month we did have the landowner and an adjoining property owner here who were all in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4141)|
| 1:09:10| With a proper motion and a second before us, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=4150)|

| 1:34:13| On page 16, item number 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| approving a procreation in the amount of $25,000 for the Hotel Motel Tax Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| to be paid to Visit Knoxville for the Big Ears Festival pursuant to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| defined services contract between Visit Knoxville and the Big Ears Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| attached as Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| This is resolution 907.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5679)|
| 1:34:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I mean Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Thank you all for the feedback that we got at the work session on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| We went back and have added a defined service contract for this appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| that I'm asking for you all to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| I also want you all to realize that, yes, I did stick my neck out on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5696)|
| 1:35:00| and the reason why I did it was, frankly, when I did my research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5700)|
| 1:35:04| it was the hotels that said that this was driving room nights for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| and it struck me as, frankly, a good use of these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5708)|
| 1:35:12| I've got the operations director from the festival here if you have any additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| I didn't want to beat a dead horse by bringing in another hotelier since we had two speak last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| All I ask is for your consideration and a vote on it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| I just simply want to speak to the educational component that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| And I think Big Ears represents an opportunity for engagement, collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5734)|
| 1:35:41| and the capacity to expand information and musical awareness for children in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5741)|
| 1:35:51| And above all, it provides an opportunity for the city of Knoxville to showcase how significant we are on a musical stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5751)|
| 1:36:03| And it certainly is an economic engine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| I, too, am very glad we had the discussion last week because I would have voted no tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5770)|
| 1:36:16| But the change, I've looked over the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| It's been vetted by the Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| That's the way it should have been done in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5783)|
| 1:36:25| It shouldn't have been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| I believe that if it stayed the way it was when it opened up a Pandora's box to approve a lot of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| people come and ask the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| I like the idea that it be vetted through Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| Visit Knoxville can ask for audits, how the money is being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| So with this change, I am okay with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Raising the question at the work session and looking at tonight's agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5812)|
| 1:37:01| there are, when you consider the entire budget of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| some things that are of no significance in a way except for the person that's bringing it before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5827)|
| 1:37:14| For example, the grant funds for Knox County schools this month is just $8,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5834)|
| 1:37:23| That's all of the grant funds that is being handled by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| Or item 28, we're looking at a $1,000 donation to the Sheriff's Department as it relates to the K-9 program, $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5848)|
| 1:37:41| And then as we look at our constituent funds, what we have the right or ability to disperse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5861)|
| 1:37:48| people have to fill out a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| They have to say specifically what they're going to do with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| Therein lie the two points that I was trying to raise last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| One was in response to where's the money going to go, and it was said into the general fund of big ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5881)|
| 1:38:09| I can't say I'm going to give constituent money to Gibbs High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5889)|
| 1:38:17| I've got to say Gibbs Middle School, and I'm going to buy sheet music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| So I realize that we've got to a better point than we were then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5903)|
| 1:38:28| I would just like to make sure that ongoing these items are brought up during the appropriate time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5908)|
| 1:38:36| when the administration is receiving paperwork to process these contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5916)|
| 1:38:43| and that they're not in the future show up in the middle of the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| without the opportunity to say where the money is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| We apparently at the beginning of a budget allocate all the dollars that we think we're going to flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| and then to somewhere in the middle of the year say, oh, well, it's just $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| But as the budget goes, who are we going to take $25,000 away from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| So I'm satisfied with the answers as long as we realize we need to have these contracts submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5948)|
| 1:39:18| at the proper period interval of the contract of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Yeah, I'm glad we had the work session because I did have an opportunity to review some of our defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5967)|
| 1:39:36| What I'm concerned about is the testimony that we received last Monday was that the city of Knoxville gave them $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| The visit in Knoxville gave them $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| And then now we want to take in another $25,000 out of their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| out of the hotel-motel tax to donate it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| The other thing that concerns me as a member of the Finance Committee is we've undertaken another $50,000 obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| under the hotel-motel tax fund called the Competitive Airfare Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| which how many of you are familiar with what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| Can I see two people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| Three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Okay, three out of the 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| And currently the hotel-motel tax fund is flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| I mean, we're going to be lucky if we meet the $8 million threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| And we've got a new $50,000 commitment, and now we want to add another $25,000 commitment on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6029)|
| 1:40:38| So based on that, I just don't see how the math is going to work out, and I can't support obligating us for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6038)|
| 1:40:49| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| The $50,000 isn't new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| It's been there for two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| That's not a new appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| That's been in the hotel-motel fund two, maybe three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| Well, then how come now it's just now coming up on documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| It's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| Okay, but where has it actually been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Hotel-motel fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| It's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| It's the big categories that just showed up this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| And it's been there two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| Okay, but how do you have it listed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Under what entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| It gets paid to Innovation Valley, and it's for the competitive airfare partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| That's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| But it's not out of the hotel-motel fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Yeah, it's been that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| But Innovation Valley is not out of the hotel-motel fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| That's the entity that uses the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| It's for that partnership, but they are the vehicle that drives that partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| It's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| That's nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| It's a six-year-old program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6104)|
| 1:41:45| Is it six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| I knew it was two or three, I thought, but it's been there for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| Okay, but it's just now showing up on some documents as a separate item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| It's always been in that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| It's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| And, Chris, this is a one-time designation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| It's not a reoccurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| No, it's not recurring, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| But it would be paid out of the hotel-motel tax fund?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| Which we are going to be, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| I don't know if we'll be flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I think we may be above flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| But I think early we see how we close out the next two or three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| or some festivals that they have that could drive up that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| But what I wanted to speak to was the competitive airfare partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| That's been there since it was announced, you said six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| I think maybe four to six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Five or six years ago, so it's been a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| I've just now found it show up on some of our county documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| So it's not actually been a line item listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| It may have been grouped in with something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Those documents are there for, I mean, our records are there to view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| You approve the budget every year, and it's there to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| Well, they're aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| But if only three out of 11 knew what I was talking about, obviously they didn't spot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| And that's why I didn't either, so just until this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| But thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| Well, I sit on the Visit Knoxville Board, and I'm kind of well aware of what this process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| And, you know, Big Ears, if we spent $150,000 on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6197)|
| 1:43:22| we couldn't have bought the advertising it brought us for the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| This was talked about in the Wall Street Journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| It was talked about in Rolling Stone Magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| There were people here that have come back here off of that weekend, and we know that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6210)|
| 1:43:37| And so part of that $60,000 from Visit Knoxville, some of that was ancillary services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6217)|
| 1:43:43| with hosting the media fam or the familiarization tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6223)|
| 1:43:48| I mean, I don't like the way that we got the process cleaned up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| and I think that I don't think it's a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| I think it's one of the best festivals that's going around in the east, southeast of the country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6235)|
| 1:44:03| It's been compared to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| And so I get the process was not as clean as we'd like it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| but this is a good expenditure of money through Visit Knoxville as long as it flows that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| But the question of the investment is truly there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| and hotel-motel tax is slightly, it's not flat, it's slightly up compared to last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6259)|
| 1:44:26| and also compared to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6266)|
| 1:44:28| So I think we're going to be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| I wouldn't have, as long as it goes through the correct process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| But the investment that we've made in this festival, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| we've made significant investment in Dogwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| We've made significant investment in Quincentennial and other things and Rossini.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6278)|
| 1:44:45| But this one truly brings people from all over the world to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| and we couldn't have bought that advertising if it was $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| So I think it's a great investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| I would like, is anybody from Visit Knoxville here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| I guess Commissioner Andrews might be able to answer this question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| How are they audited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| I mean, are there audits done by Visit Knoxville for this much expenditure that's out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| Do they just write a check for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| No, generally those processes are done as they plan an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| and go through these items, and Visit Knoxville knows, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| if they ask, they say, we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| they'll ask for an expenditure just like the county handles the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| It's not just a cut the check and go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| There is a process to all that, and all those things have to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| And they can actually go back, hindsight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| and look at what was spent on what in the festival if we sponsor that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| On that money, we can demand receipts for our money and rears for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| So Visit Knoxville is very much a part of the process for this event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| and Kim is very comfortable that this money was used for the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6351)|
| 1:45:56| and will be used for the right thing in educational and free programming to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| So we do have checks and balances there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| I'm so sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| I just want to make an observation for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| The public doesn't know what our budget process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| and I think that is one of the opportunities as a commission we have to present that process to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6375)|
| 1:46:24| because they have absolutely no idea what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| And if that process was public, I think they would have been in the parameters that are needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6388)|
| 1:46:35| and we need to do a better job of outlaying what that process is, how to engage that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| because this budget then will then have a reflection to see what the needs are of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6402)|
| 1:46:49| because at this point we have no idea what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6409)|
| 1:46:53| I would like to point out, Commissioner Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| this is the first year in many years that we are having a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| and a public work session on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6419)|
| 1:47:04| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| I also wanted to follow up on what Commissioner Daly had mentioned about audits and follow-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| This is all going to be going into a 501c3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| 501c3s are required to file a 990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| A 990 is the nonprofit equivalent of a tax return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| What makes a 990 different than, say, a tax return that you or I might do is that it's a public document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| And once we get through this, when they file that, that will be a public document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| and I think I'm sure as part of that audit process we will audit the heck out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| to make sure that everything is as says that will attract all the major expenses that they allocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| as well as the revenues that they bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| We also will show who serves on their board, any other kind of relevant information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| It's all public information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| I would like to make one more comment then based on what the public knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| The BEC knows how to request funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6489)|
| 1:48:12| James White Ford is sitting here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| They know how to request funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| and I think that the majority of the senior commissioners knew we were a little out of process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| and that's what I was trying to bring to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Yes, I do like the way that we went through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| and brought it back around to where it follows the way we're supposed to be doing business better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| I do appreciate Mr. Nyston, Commissioner Nyston, for bringing this need to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| and I appreciate the way everybody handled this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| I would also like to remind everybody, well, really I don't like doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6527)|
| 1:48:52| but part of our motel tax could have been it being not as high as we were hoping it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| It could have something to do with we had a four and seven football team last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| That has everything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| Okay, we have a motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6547)|

| 1:49:17| Okay, that's ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| The motion carries ten to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6562)|

| 1:50:04| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6604)|
| 1:50:06| We have a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| I just don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| I just would just like a brief overview of what really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| what does custody prevention and intervention services mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| Is there anyone here from juvenile court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6623)|

| 1:50:47| This is a grant we've had for over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| We partnership with the Department of Children's Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| and was recommended by the juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| As far as clinical aspects and overall, probably the worst guy you could ask to bring up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| I'm here for the financial side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| Any questions you may have, I'll be more than happy to get you in the proper connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| to get you all the information you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| It's actually part of the probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| They're kind of keeping kids out of custody, juvenile custody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| into keeping them with their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| It's a support mechanism through psychological clinical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| Are there any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| We have a proper motion and a second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6693)|
| 1:51:34| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| Thank you, Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6696)|
| 1:51:44| We need to go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6704)|
| 1:51:55| We're at second public forum and I want to see if Chelsea or Sue showed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6715)|
| 1:52:09| Okay, we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| Item number 73 is discussion item regarding the renaming of the Petticoat Road Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6734)|
| 1:52:22| We did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| The discussion we had earlier tells you a little bit about the history of the communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| and how things are named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6750)|
| 1:52:32| The thing that I would like to see here is that from this point on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| I think Commissioner Carringer and I are going to be looking at a place to honor Mary Lou Horner a little bit better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6756)|
| 1:52:43| but we really need to look in the history and the background of the community in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6763)|
| 1:52:47| where we do these honorariums for bridge naming, road namings or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6767)|
| 1:52:55| If you have any questions about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| because we did have a little bit of a problem in the area about the community involvement in these namings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6777)|
| 1:53:04| and I don't know how we would handle that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| but maybe have a process that we look into these items like that before we get in a situation where we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6786)|
| 1:53:17| in the situation we are in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| Anyone wish to add to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| Discussion of rules and procedures for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| For deferrals or rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| We have no rule and procedure for what happened last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6817)|
| 1:53:42| I would like to get the Rules Committee to meet and set forth procedures for the process of a developer asking for a deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6822)|
| 1:53:52| and by that I mean a timeline that it has to be in by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| Are we going to require them if they want an automatic deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| First of all, are we going to grant them an automatic deferral like BZA and MPC does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6840)|
| 1:54:05| If so, does it have to be in before the agenda is released so that it's listed on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6845)|
| 1:54:11| I would just like for the Rules Committee to get together and try to find some way to get this into written rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| so that future chairmen have something to follow besides the precedent and the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6858)|
| 1:54:26| and procedures unwritten that have been followed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6866)|
| 1:54:31| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| I have been spoken with the law department, and you can go to the BZA, and I've got a copy of them at the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6874)|
| 1:54:41| I will be calling a Rules Committee meeting, and actually, I've got a long list just for you all to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6881)|
| 1:54:49| We need to think about time and date of reorganization, not this, are you available here, are you available there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| Legislative committee, do we need a legislative committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| Do we need a consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6899)|
| 1:55:01| I'll just skip that one for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| All resolutions must be vetted by the law department so that we know that a resolution is coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6904)|
| 1:55:12| Our good resolution has been vetted by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| And, of course, rezoning the bylaws and then sitting here thinking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| we went through a long consent calendar and we held a lot of people here for an hour, 45 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| Is there any rules that we can put the consent calendar at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| Do the general business and read the consent calendar after general business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| There are some things that we'll have a Rules Committee meeting here pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| I'll get with the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| Ms. Jill, she's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| I'll get with Jill, and we'll call a Rules Committee on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6943)|
| 1:55:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| Commissioner Carringer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Yeah, just to restate for those that may not have been here or anybody that's tuned in on TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6951)|
| 1:55:57| with what happened with the big development in District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6957)|
| 1:56:06| when this came before us to talk about should we give them another 30 days and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| it was put on that I hadn't really done it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| but I was taking the suggestion that the surveyor who was representing the person who wanted to develop it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| I was taking his suggestion that he wanted to defer it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| therefore making a motion that we defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| And then for them to get the opportunity to defer it for another 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| so now they've had 60 days, and my district and the community of people had already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=6996)|
| 1:56:43| I mean, they're together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| They are on this, and for us to have to wait another 30 days and cancel out things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7006)|
| 1:56:53| and people cancel their plans was not fair to my constituents in District 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7013)|
| 1:57:01| And then it was all because everybody thought it was me that had done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7021)|
| 1:57:08| So I just wanted to clarify that, and we made a big mistake by doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7028)|
| 1:57:15| because there again, we're talking about a rezoning and a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7035)|
| 1:57:21| and as I said, 60 days to change anybody's decision on that should have been made to not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7041)|
| 1:57:30| So I represent my district, and I stand true to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7050)|
| 1:57:36| and I am disappointed that they're having to wait another 30 days on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| So I'm glad that we're clarifying that, and since we didn't have any rules written down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| saying that we had to give that developer another 30 days regardless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7066)|
| 1:57:52| however anybody wanted to take it, should not have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7072)|
| 1:58:01| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| Commissioner Nostrand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| If this is the last thing for this meeting, I just wanted to recognize Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7089)|

| 1:58:23| It was the first one of those that I've been to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| I know that many other folks in our body have gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| Commissioner Schoonmaker, Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Wright, Commissioner Gill were all there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7108)|
| 1:58:32| and we give Dwight a lot of thanks in these meetings, and I said Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7112)|
| 1:58:40| No, it's her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7120)|
| 1:58:41| Yeah, but, Dwight, you're a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7124)|
| 1:58:45| And you are having, while I'd heard it was neat to see you in your element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| and to see how much you're respected by folks who do this all over the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| So, you know, I just thought about that, and I just wanted to call you out and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7135)|
| 1:59:02| We're grateful for your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| But, Doug, you're very well respected by so many other folks around this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| We're lucky to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Thank you, Commissioner Nostrand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| A lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| A big deal, I think, is definitely not one of them, but I appreciate the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| And I just, for those of you that attend, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| I know you take time away from jobs and family and home and schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| and it means a lot to Tennessee County Services for you to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| This is the third largest and most populous county in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| So it's good for us to be represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| It's good for all of you to be there and give voice to your constituent statewide interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| and it means a lot to, I think, both your constituents here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7179)|
| 1:59:42| I think it's time and effort well spent, and I think it means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| I certainly know it means a lot to the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| I've enjoyed my tenure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7188)|
| 1:59:50| I've got another four or five months serving with TCSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| I really enjoy it, and I hope I equip myself in a way that makes this body proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7194)|
| 1:59:59| We're going to find you a bridge, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7199)|
| 2:00:03| Just not name anything after me, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| He'll build his own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7208)|
| 2:00:13| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| I also wanted to say thank you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7215)|
| 2:00:17| I was not able to make this last one, but I will say I'm always proud of what Dwight does to represent us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7217)|
| 2:00:27| which also, this probably isn't the time, but I will throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| So now that Commissioner Nystrom has had the opportunity to see what we do with TCSA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| and the meetings and how important it is, since we don't have a lobbyist in Nashville like our school board has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7238)|
| 2:00:47| to represent us and keep us up on what's happening with our state legislators and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7247)|
| 2:00:54| I do feel it's very important that we're involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| That being said, we're going to have a couple of new commissioners coming on, and now that Mr. Nystrom has it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7259)|
| 2:01:06| I don't know how our budget is going to be able to allow us all to be able to have the opportunity to go to these conferences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7266)|
| 2:01:14| and learn, so that might be something we might need to discuss tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7281)|
| 2:01:22| The rest of you can let me know about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| but that is a concern of who's allowed to be able to go and learn and to find out what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7284)|
| 2:01:34| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7294)|
| 2:01:36| That is why we're going to have a Rules Committee meeting on a legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7296)|
| 2:01:41| Knox County, Dwight knows this, John and I and Charlie, we've all been telling that Knox County is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| They look towards Knox County, and I believe Commissioner Nystrom, Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7308)|
| 2:01:53| seen that this past event, that Knox County is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7313)|
| 2:01:58| We need to be represented there, and not only with Dwight and the great work that he's done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| but, you know, the executive committee, it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| John's on the bylaws committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7328)|
| 2:02:09| Charlie Bussler's been moved to transportation, and we're a big deal in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| And they look towards Knox County, and I believe that, you know, we need to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| We'll look at this legislative committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| Do we need a number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| Do we need how it's going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| But we are the TCSA, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| NC County Service Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| We are a big lobbying group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| We had some big wins two years ago with the highway tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| We've had some big wins this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| We don't need to hire lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| We need to make sure that we are the lobbyists for our group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7363)|
| 2:02:48| And we do get things done in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| And people, Anderson County, Blount County, Rhone County, all of them are looking at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7371)|
| 2:02:58| They really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| Well, I wasn't going to say anything until the comment about the lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| I'll tell you, we lost big this year down in Nashville when our bill got killed in regards to the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7387)|
| 2:03:14| That set us back another year of not being able to do what we planned to do in this county as far as the way we grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7394)|
| 2:03:20| And so losing that bill, I don't know what it cost us, but it cost us in the hundreds of thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7400)|
| 2:03:28| and maybe millions over time because that year that we're not going to be able to do the right things for our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7408)|
| 2:03:34| and that's threatening our growth within certain areas and getting rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| We've got to get rid of that urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| It's hurting us as we grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| So during appropriations, I'm going to ask that we have a request for services requisition go out for a lobbyist for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7424)|
| 2:03:55| because TCCA can only represent 95 counties, and sometimes it's 91 versus 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7435)|
| 2:04:03| And so we've got to be careful with that, and I think that's where we lost on the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| So I'm going to ask for that appropriation at the end of the closeout of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| So kind of be thinking about that because I think it's very important that they do a lot of things well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| but they always can't represent all 95 counties well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| And I think that we saw that with the urban growth plan vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7460)|
| 2:04:24| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| And I think we're going to have to have a diverse and long-term conversation with the people who participate at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7468)|
| 2:04:35| And as we look to make sure Knox County with that urban growth plan is being represented by all aspects of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7475)|
| 2:04:42| and not just some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| The reason why the urban growth plan failed was if we would have known as a group that participated in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7491)|
| 2:04:59| we could have got the right people to sign on the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7499)|
| 2:05:03| We had Senator Nicely sign on part of the bill, and we had somebody else sign on the bill, didn't know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7503)|
| 2:05:11| We could have sent that information down there if we would have known that the bill had been sent down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7511)|
| 2:05:18| And we could have probably got it through with the right authors on it to tell them what it was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7518)|
| 2:05:25| But they wanted to get it on there quickly, and the person that was representing us did not represent Knox County properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7525)|
| 2:05:36| And, again, we're on those legislative committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| We could have got it through if we would have known the bill was down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| And we did not know the bill was down there until we started getting calls from the state level saying, what's this bill about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7545)|
| 2:05:53| And, again, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7553)|
| 2:05:55| You got called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| I got called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7556)|
| 2:05:58| What was it about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| And I'm saying, what are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7559)|
| 2:06:01| They said the urban growth plan, but it was already presented to the, and nobody would stand up and talk to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7561)|
| 2:06:06| We have to explain the people that author it, that sign on to it from the Senate to the House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7566)|
| 2:06:12| so they can argue it on the floor and it would have gone through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| So it's not about hiring a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| It's making sure that we're communicating properly with our legislators down in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| So the author of the bill didn't know what the bill was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| That's the reasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| The people that signed the bill, you have to have a senator and you have to have a representative to author the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7590)|
| 2:06:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| Our representatives, our senators, Briggs, Massey, even in my area we've got McNally as a senator that represents part of Pell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7603)|
| 2:07:00| We could have explained to those representatives what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7620)|
| 2:07:04| And I forgot, who did we have as a representative sign on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| Can I address that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| Okay, you can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7631)|
| 2:07:12| But that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| We've got to know what we're sending down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| If it's for the whole county, let us know because we participate in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| And one other thing about what is a big deal going along with what Carson Daly said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7641)|
| 2:07:28| we have an automatic seat on the board of the TCCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7648)|
| 2:07:38| And it is the chairman and it's by our ordinance here in Knox County that sits on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7658)|
| 2:07:44| So anyway, we do have representation down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| We've just got to let the people know that are signing the bill what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7669)|
| 2:07:54| And Senator Massey was asked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| And he said he didn't know what it was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| They just asked him to put his name on the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7679)|
| 2:08:01| So how can you have somebody represent you and sign that bill without letting them know what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7681)|
| 2:08:08| That's just my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| Commissioner Skinnecker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| Commissioner Anders, I think the problem happened when Martin Daniel was the sponsor in the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7692)|
| 2:08:19| And what we should have done in hindsight was on a Saturday sit down with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| and explain to him what public chapter 1101 was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7704)|
| 2:08:28| After I was aware that they had the committee meeting, I went back and looked at the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7708)|
| 2:08:34| And most of the members of that committee are former county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7714)|
| 2:08:40| And Mr. Wergo immediately said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7720)|
| 2:08:44| Well, so what you're saying, Representative Daniels, is you want to eliminate public chapter 1101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7724)|
| 2:08:51| And the representative was just standing there because he had no clue what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| And so had he had the opportunity to be briefed and really understand what he was doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| I think our success rate would have been a lot higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| But again, nobody knew that bill was going through the House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| And another thing that we're addressing from the county commissioner's side is seeing if we can't have the state general assembly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7752)|
| 2:09:22| revise their rules so that when a bill is filed, and instead of just saying it's a bill about electric cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7762)|
| 2:09:31| and how many are in the inventory of the state government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7771)|
| 2:09:34| that it actually say this is a transportation bill or this is a judicial bill or this is a local government bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7774)|
| 2:09:42| And so we're going to try to see if there's a way to change how actually bills are listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7782)|
| 2:09:50| because I think the bill originally was listed as some obnoxious title that didn't mean anything to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7790)|
| 2:09:57| And that was the other problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7797)|
| 2:10:01| I'll chime in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7801)|

| 2:10:17| And I'll just leave it there, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7817)|

| 2:12:27| 4-F-18-SP is a request of Metropolitan Planning Commission for a West City Sector Plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7947)|
| 2:12:35| updating the proposed land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7955)|

| 2:12:44| by a vote of 11-0-2 on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7964)|

| 2:12:52| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7972)|
| 2:12:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| I just want to ask a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7974)|
| 2:12:56| Under the background information and the methodology you use, are we assigning the baseline use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7976)|
| 2:13:04| for those areas to just streamline the language of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| Is this the purpose of this in removing the old slope protection area and stream protection area data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7987)|
| 2:13:13| Are we just simply changing the language to update it under the North City Sector Plan as well as the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=7993)|
| 2:13:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| Yes, because under your background information, those are the recommendations that you're using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8004)|
| 2:13:30| and I would just assume it is because we're updating the language associated with those sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8010)|
| 2:13:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8016)|
| 2:13:37| It's just part of a map modernization project that our staff undertook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8020)|
| 2:13:41| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8021)|
| 2:13:42| Well, I'd like to make a motion to approve this per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| I'd also have one discussion point after the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8031)|
| 2:13:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8032)|
| 2:13:53| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| My discussion point kind of is a follow-up to what my friend Commissioner Gill brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8034)|
| 2:13:59| As I recall, when we did this for some of the other zones last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| what makes this kind of interesting is I guess in the past, and we can clarify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8043)|
| 2:14:08| you often might have something that might have an area that was ridgetop or hilltop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| that could be almost a zoning in and of itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| and this is a way to maintain our zoning while then taking the protective areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8057)|
| 2:14:22| and establishing it as an easy-to-read overlay on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8062)|
| 2:14:26| So it takes things that could have gotten confused with the zoning related to hilltop protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8066)|
| 2:14:32| and river protection, takes that from a zoning concern and makes that an overlay onto other zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8072)|
| 2:14:40| and that was what I recall from a conversation I guess last year or the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8080)|
| 2:14:44| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| We have a proper motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8089)|
| 2:14:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8093)|

| 2:18:58| Ma'am, if you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| My name is Chelsea Vivas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| I live at 1012 East Copeland Road, and I timed this out, and it's a little bit over the five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8345)|
| 2:19:12| so if you don't mind, it's just about a minute over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8352)|
| 2:19:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8354)|
| 2:19:15| That'll be fine, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8356)|
| 2:19:17| I'm here today on behalf of myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8357)|
| 2:19:19| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| Don't rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| If you go a little bit over that, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8361)|
| 2:19:23| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8364)|
| 2:19:25| I'm here today on behalf of myself, my family, and my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| to once again voice our concerns about the rezoning and planned development of Copeland Farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8368)|
| 2:19:33| The Commission should already have copies of my previous statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| and images from the April MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| This evening, I want to address more concerns that have been brought to light,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| some of which were discussed at the community meeting we held on May 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| This meeting brought together representatives from the County Planning and Development Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8389)|
| 2:19:54| school board members, Smithville was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| and current candidates as well as 60-plus members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| The first major concern is traffic and road conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8402)|
| 2:20:06| Pedigo will be where the main access points for this development will be located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8406)|
| 2:20:11| making Smithville responsible for donating any land needed for widening the road at these access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8411)|
| 2:20:17| However, this does not address a major concern the community has, which is East Copeland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8417)|
| 2:20:23| This is the road that is documented in the images I included in the MPC packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8423)|
| 2:20:28| We understand that Smithville is not responsible for any improvements to this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| as there will be no access points for their development placed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| This also means there is no traffic study required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| As someone who lives on this road and sees it traveled every day, this would be a massive oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| East Copeland Drive is already used as a major cut-through to avoid congestion on Emory Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8447)|
| 2:20:53| and traffic will only worsen with the addition of 240-plus homes built directly adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| East Copeland Drive is classified as a major collector by the MPC's major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| The U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration states that the lane width for a collector road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| should be 10 to 12 feet for a single lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8471)|
| 2:21:15| As it stands, East Copeland Drive, which is a two-lane road, only measures between 12 and 14 feet total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8475)|
| 2:21:22| I ask everyone here to imagine the result of adding 500-plus vehicles to such a narrow road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| that includes many blind hills and sharp curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| Also worth mentioning are the intersections at Pedigo and Emory and at Bishop and Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8490)|
| 2:21:36| Both are heavily used with no traffic lights, making right turns difficult and left turns near impossible and very dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8496)|
| 2:21:43| There are no current plans to improve any of the roads in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| Our community wants to know how to get the already existing problems addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8507)|
| 2:21:52| before more development, especially one of this size, can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| Is it necessary to have repeated accidents and fatalities before these problems are fixed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8516)|
| 2:22:01| The second concern I want to address is property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| In the area surrounding Copeland Farm, it is far more common to have one house on multiple acre lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8525)|
| 2:22:12| This kind of growth would be ideal for the area and surrounding roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| However, for the sake of comparison, there are three small developments on Pedigo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8536)|
| 2:22:22| which I will focus on as they are most comparable to the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| Berkeley Estates, Teeks Grove, and Grand Colony are all built at approximately the same 3-per-acre density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8546)|
| 2:22:33| that has been recommended for this new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| As verified by local realtors, in the last six years, not one of these homes has sold for less than $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| While we understand that the plan for the development is still being laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| Smithville has already mentioned having many homes in the development that would be near a $180,000 price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8567)|
| 2:22:55| This would be $40,000 below the lowest estimated value for homes in the neighboring area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| and bring down the overall property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8581)|
| 2:23:04| According to numbers collected from the MLS website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| there are generally many homes available at or around the $180,000 price point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8587)|
| 2:23:13| What Powell needs are homes at a slightly higher price point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| homes that are closer to the $250,000 and above mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8596)|
| 2:23:22| People who already have roots in Powell area and wish to find a larger home are unable to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| As a result, we are consistently losing valuable members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| We want to offer a place where people can start their family and stay within Powell area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| even if they wish to upgrade their homes in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| We do understand the owner of Copeland Farm has a right to sell this property and make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| We also understand that the developers have a right and a need to make a profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8627)|
| 2:23:53| However, should profit margins for the sale and development of this land have a place in deciding what's best for a community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8633)|
| 2:24:00| Lastly, I want to address the quality of life issue, which I have essentially been talking about this whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8640)|
| 2:24:07| Overcrowding the roads that are already unfit for the current traffic load will only force the county to spend money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8647)|
| 2:24:14| to expedite improvements that aren't even up for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| Overtaxing our water supplier, Hallsdale Powell, will only worsen our already skyrocketing water bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| as they struggle to keep up with an exploding customer base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| The school system this development is zoned for is already at capacity and will soon be overcrowded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| at which times the schools will have to undergo a major rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| This means families moving into these newly built homes in hopes that their children can go to Bricky McLeod Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| Powell Middle School, and Powell High School may no longer be zoned for these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| There are already two more developments in the works that will be zoned for this school system and water supplier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| One is breaking ground off East Emory and will have 64 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| The other is going before the NPZ for rezoning approval in June and is proposing 40-plus lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8702)|
| 2:25:09| There are also some environmental factors to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8709)|
| 2:25:13| There is an existing wet spring on the property that will need to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8713)|
| 2:25:17| There are some areas on the farmland that fall under hillside slope protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| which I'm sure have already been noted by yourselves and the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8723)|
| 2:25:27| Finally, if this development is approved, the community would like to see the remaining trees on the property saved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8727)|
| 2:25:33| as most are larger, older trees and at a density of three per acre will be very difficult to replace if they are cut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8733)|
| 2:25:43| In closing, I have been told throughout this process emotion will only hurt our argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8743)|
| 2:25:48| I believe that to be true, but I also hope the facts and numbers I have presented today speak loudly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8755)|
| 2:25:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8756)|
| 2:26:01| If you would, please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| Josh Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8765)|
| 2:26:06| I'm with Smithbilt Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8766)|
| 2:26:08| I'm at 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| Good evening, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8771)|
| 2:26:12| I'd like to actually start out by just thanking the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8772)|
| 2:26:15| This proposed development will not be our largest development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8775)|
| 2:26:18| but it is probably the largest opposition we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| And the way they've handled themselves with respect to professionals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| as emotional as their house can be and as their property and their community is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| I commend them for being very businesslike and respectful for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| knowing that we have a business and that we're all business on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8793)|
| 2:26:37| We respect on the other aspect that it's their community and they want to protect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| and I commend them for bringing up these issues that they brought up in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| and as well as MPC and on the May 15th community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8804)|
| 2:26:50| They brought up some good points, all legit concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| and that's why, as developers, we go and we get the experts involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| For instance, we had a traffic study done by Cannon & Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| a third-party engineering company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| Paid them $7,000 to do a traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8822)|
| 2:27:05| and they came back with no necessary road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8825)|
| 2:27:09| because the current traffic on Pedigo does not warrant anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8829)|
| 2:27:15| We actually didn't do this, but at the May 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8835)|
| 2:27:19| the community brought together with the chief operating officer of Knox County Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8839)|
| 2:27:26| and he explained to us that as Powell has grown out of the existing homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8846)|
| 2:27:31| and they've gotten an older status, that the kids are actually outgrowing the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8851)|
| 2:27:37| and people aren't reselling to bring younger kids in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8857)|
| 2:27:39| so over the next five years, Berkey Elementary specifically will have declining of 85 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8859)|
| 2:27:47| Another thing they brought up is East Copeland Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8867)|
| 2:27:50| I drove it multiple times trying to understand the argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8870)|
| 2:27:53| and I'm sure people cut through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| It just doesn't make sense as a cut through to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8875)|
| 2:27:56| but I'm sure that there's two sides to that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| We will not access Copeland Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8879)|
| 2:28:01| The only thing we'll be doing is having two ingress and ingress intersections on Pedigo Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8881)|
| 2:28:08| We will deter anyone going down Copeland Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8888)|
| 2:28:11| and would encourage the opposition over the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| and we can help facilitate this conversation of maybe putting a speed hump or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8894)|
| 2:28:18| to deter other people cutting through Copeland Road as a shortcut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8898)|
| 2:28:22| If that's something that residents on Copeland Road would want to entertain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8902)|
| 2:28:26| we'd be more than happy to facilitate that conversation with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| The last thing they talked about was the community pricing and the home valuations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8910)|
| 2:28:39| We know we don't build the big $500,000 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| We know we don't build the big expensive houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| We know our product, and we know that people call us a niche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8924)|
| 2:28:47| It's actually the majority of Knox County with a household income of $52,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8927)|
| 2:28:52| Our houses are what people can afford,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8932)|
| 2:28:54| and affordability is getting harder and harder as land is getting more expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8934)|
| 2:28:57| building materials are going up, and lot increases in development costs are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| That's no one's problem of ours, and we understand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| and that's why we go under contract to buy land, and we take the risk of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8944)|
| 2:29:07| That's no one else's problem. That's our problem, and we face that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| So cost and money has no winning conversation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| But what we'd like to do is ask that based on the facts with Knox County staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8955)|
| 2:29:19| and MPC recommendation, this board, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| zone this property at three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8962)|
| 2:29:26| and we can bring a new development with different price points from $179,000 to $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8966)|
| 2:29:34| $200,000 to $225,000, and hopefully we have the estate lot sitting up on the hill around the $300,000 to $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8974)|
| 2:29:42| Again, with this zoning, it will allow us to do amenities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8982)|
| 2:29:47| which is obviously a big seller and a big selling point for communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8987)|
| 2:29:52| especially in this affordable range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| They have a $1,200 mortgage payment, but they have a pool and a clubhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8995)|
| 2:29:59| that rivals some of the nicer communities throughout Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=8999)|
| 2:30:04| So, again, I'll end it with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9004)|
| 2:30:07| and ask that this county commission zone the property three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9007)|
| 2:30:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9011)|
| 2:30:17| Vice Chair Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9017)|
| 2:30:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9019)|
| 2:30:20| I'm going to make a motion that we approve the recommendation of MPC staff for three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9020)|
| 2:30:28| and go to PR plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9028)|
| 2:30:32| Before I get a second on this, I want to ask the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9032)|
| 2:30:38| they did a road study down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9038)|
| 2:30:40| and when they accessed the main road, Emery Road off of Pettigo down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9040)|
| 2:30:46| have you noticed anything about the site distance when you get off of Pettigo when you turn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9046)|
| 2:30:53| If you're turning left, the hump there on the side where the fire hydrant and things there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| and there's a house there I think may be torn down for better site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| on the left-hand side of Pettigo heading south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| Have you all looked at that, or do you have any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9068)|
| 2:31:10| you won't do any recommendations about when it's zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9070)|
| 2:31:17| until you see the final plan of what needs to be done out there for the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| Yes, Commissioner, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9082)|
| 2:31:23| I'm not familiar with the plan that you referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| The planning commission hasn't conducted any road study out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9086)|
| 2:31:31| You haven't done any road studies out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| We have not, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9093)|
| 2:31:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9095)|
| 2:31:36| When the plan is presented, how will you address some of the road issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| the egress that they're going to have into the subdivision since both entrances are going to go on Pettigo Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9100)|
| 2:31:48| If the rezoning is approved, they'll be required to come in with their concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| and at that point, MPC staff along with Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9112)|
| 2:31:56| will take a look at their plan and assess it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9116)|
| 2:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9119)|
| 2:32:00| And then they will also access the plan about the blue stream down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| and the protection of the stream and things of that sort at that point in time, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9128)|
| 2:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9129)|
| 2:32:10| That's what I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| So I stand by my motion so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9135)|
| 2:32:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9136)|
| 2:32:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9137)|
| 2:32:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9140)|
| 2:32:22| For the 82 acres, how many total homes do you plan on building there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9142)|
| 2:32:30| It actually surveyed out to be about 80 acres, and once we get the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9150)|
| 2:32:34| I can't remember the exact number, but that's around 80 acres, about 241 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9154)|
| 2:32:40| And again, we've got a cluster off of the hill slope protection, which is where the existing house already sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9160)|
| 2:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9166)|
| 2:32:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9167)|
| 2:32:48| And then just for the young lady on the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9168)|
| 2:32:52| I just want to make a comment that the email that we got today with the drawing with the density units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9172)|
| 2:32:58| that was very well done, and I appreciate you or whoever took the time to actually put those numbers together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9178)|
| 2:33:04| because that gives us a good overview of what the surrounding community is like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9184)|
| 2:33:11| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9191)|
| 2:33:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| First of all, I wanted to clarify, this is Smithfield or Josh that you all were asking for five units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9194)|
| 2:33:26| but NPC recommended three drilling units per acre, and that's what you said in your talk up here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9206)|
| 2:33:35| So is that what you all are saying, the three acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| Just three acres, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9220)|
| 2:33:41| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9221)|
| 2:33:42| So you all are in agreement with what NPC has recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9222)|
| 2:33:45| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9225)|
| 2:33:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9226)|
| 2:33:47| And then just to clarify, the homes that you all are planning to build there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9227)|
| 2:33:52| how do they relate to the homes in Shannon Valley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9232)|
| 2:33:55| And are they, because those homes are, I mean, they've gone up and up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9235)|
| 2:34:01| and they're even more valuable now because of the Gibbs Middle School going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9241)|
| 2:34:07| But it has a very nice clubhouse, very nice pool, and I know all the families have the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9247)|
| 2:34:16| Would this development have clubhouse, pools, sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9256)|
| 2:34:20| Because I know all the families that live over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9260)|
| 2:34:22| In fact, my daughter still owns a home over there that she has leased out to others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9262)|
| 2:34:32| because everybody is so happy with that type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9272)|
| 2:34:35| And I know the homes there have increased to where it would be hard for me to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9275)|
| 2:34:42| that there would be maybe a handful that might sell under $200,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| So is this development pretty much what Shannon Valley is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9287)|
| 2:34:53| Because that's the one I'm really familiar with and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9293)|
| 2:34:57| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9297)|
| 2:34:58| The Shannon Valley you're referring to is comprised of what we call our signature series homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| and those signature series homes will make up about 60 percent of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| as well as a pool and a clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9308)|
| 2:35:10| And so when you're talking about the two different entrances and all there on Copeland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9310)|
| 2:35:14| you're talking about the pretty much, very much similar same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9314)|
| 2:35:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9319)|
| 2:35:20| Or pedigo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9320)|
| 2:35:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9321)|
| 2:35:22| Because they have the two entrances and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9322)|
| 2:35:24| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9324)|
| 2:35:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9326)|
| 2:35:27| Thank you, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9327)|
| 2:35:29| Stay up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9329)|
| 2:35:30| First, I guess, is to Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9330)|
| 2:35:32| I apologize, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9332)|
| 2:35:35| Amy, we heard one thing about a number from schools from the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9335)|
| 2:35:41| another number from Josh that they say that's going to be dropping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9341)|
| 2:35:44| You say there's going to be, MPC says there's going to be 168.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| Where do those numbers come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9347)|
| 2:35:49| Are those just statistic numbers from the U.S. Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9349)|
| 2:35:55| MPC generates those numbers based on a formula that's been developed over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9355)|
| 2:36:01| That's about the extent of my knowledge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9361)|
| 2:36:04| I can get you all more information about how that's actually calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9364)|
| 2:36:08| Well, I guess the question, the follow-up question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9368)|
| 2:36:11| are these numbers pretty much accurate in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| Mr. Daly, Commissioner Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| I actually had this conversation with Russ Oaks the other day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| and asked him how they come up with this yield that they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9379)|
| 2:36:23| And he has actually went back years later and did comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| and said it's strikingly accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9386)|
| 2:36:28| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9388)|
| 2:36:29| That's the question we want to know, is from one side to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9389)|
| 2:36:33| So we can really take 168.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9393)|
| 2:36:35| We'll probably be the students there according to this MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9395)|
| 2:36:39| So that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9399)|
| 2:36:40| That's what I wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9401)|
| 2:36:43| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9403)|
| 2:36:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9404)|
| 2:36:45| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9405)|
| 2:36:46| One question, but I'd like for both to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9406)|
| 2:36:49| I think I heard the word cluster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9409)|
| 2:36:52| I also heard some locations there would be one residence per acre at the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9412)|
| 2:37:02| The hill slope up on the. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9422)|
| 2:37:04| Okay, so you're taking advantage of slope and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9424)|
| 2:37:10| by having more than three residences per acre in some locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9430)|
| 2:37:17| I don't think we. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9437)|
| 2:37:19| No, I don't think it's only yielded out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9439)|
| 2:37:21| Once you get the roads and drainage and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| it's only yielded out for more than three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| What we are trying to do is get that higher-end price point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9445)|
| 2:37:28| and the higher-end price point yields to the view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| So that view on where the existing house is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| makes a perfect example of where state lots can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9453)|
| 2:37:38| To say 80 acres and three residents per acre is 240?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9458)|
| 2:37:43| 241, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9463)|
| 2:37:45| Okay, so how many did you say would be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| 241.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9467)|
| 2:37:49| Okay, if you've got some residences on one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9469)|
| 2:37:53| then there has to be more than three residences on some other acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9473)|
| 2:37:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| So you're taking advantage of slope and hillside protection at clustering units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9478)|
| 2:38:09| That's the way it was designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9489)|
| 2:38:11| That's what I'm saying. That's the way it was designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9491)|
| 2:38:14| And MPC is saying he's saying what you all have approved is correct, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9494)|
| 2:38:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9500)|
| 2:38:21| No, I'm asking MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9501)|
| 2:38:23| MPC's recommendation was up to three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| Am I answering your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9507)|
| 2:38:29| Right, which would mean that there will be some acres that have one house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| and some acres have more than three houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| Potentially, I would defer to the developer on how they're going to lay out their site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9516)|
| 2:38:40| But yes, that's typically it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9520)|
| 2:38:42| I would defer to your map on that. Yes, sir, it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9522)|
| 2:38:48| Okay, is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9528)|
| 2:38:54| Does the opposition have anything they wish to respond with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| Just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9539)|
| 2:39:06| So as I understand it, as far as what Commissioner Wright was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9546)|
| 2:39:11| as far as being able to cluster homes, that's part of the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9551)|
| 2:39:15| Is there a way, since the MPC has already recommended three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9555)|
| 2:39:20| and I've gone down this road before to make sure that it was just maximum three per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9560)|
| 2:39:26| not an overall average of the property, is there a way to fight for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9566)|
| 2:39:31| or to lock that into where even though, yes, they do lose some with this hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9571)|
| 2:39:38| and can do one house per acre on some of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| is there a guarantee for the community that they cannot shove all these houses in the flatter areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9581)|
| 2:39:48| ending up with a much higher density than what the MPC has recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| Amy, would you care to take that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| I don't know that I can answer that on behalf of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9599)|
| 2:40:06| That would be a decision I would assume that you all would be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| Three units an acre did take into consideration the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9611)|
| 2:40:14| It did, correct, yes, because they originally requested five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| And I guess I could try to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| If they did, they could take that three units an acre and put it on half the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9620)|
| 2:40:26| and they'd never be able to touch that other half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9626)|
| 2:40:29| So it would be denser, but overall the property is at that density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9629)|
| 2:40:33| Does that make sense, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9633)|
| 2:40:34| Right, so it's an overall average versus what I kind of had been told time and time again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| was the per acre average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9639)|
| 2:40:41| It's an overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9641)|
| 2:40:42| Overall average, yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| Can I ask her a quick question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9645)|
| 2:40:47| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9647)|
| 2:40:48| So what I was asking was, it is a slope and ridge developed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9648)|
| 2:40:56| I think in the report, if you'll read it, and maybe I hope I'm correct if I'm stating this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| that part of MPC's reasoning for recommending three units an acre is it was the maximum allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9661)|
| 2:41:08| under the guidelines of slope and ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9671)|
| 2:41:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9672)|
| 2:41:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9674)|
| 2:41:15| And again, I apologize for the young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9675)|
| 2:41:20| Did you have other members that were at your community meeting that are here in the audience tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9680)|
| 2:41:25| or are you the only one here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9685)|
| 2:41:27| Yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9687)|
| 2:41:29| Oh, all of these folks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| And you're the designated spokesperson, or did any of them want to make an additional comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9691)|
| 2:41:37| We didn't realize who all these people were, but they're with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| Yes, yes, this is all part of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9700)|
| 2:41:43| We were just guided to sort of collect our ideas and have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9703)|
| 2:41:48| so we didn't take up too much of y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| Okay, we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9711)|
| 2:41:52| Thank you very much for that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9712)|
| 2:41:57| Anybody have anything else they want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9720)|
| 2:42:01| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9721)|
| 2:42:02| I think it's important that, number one, I appreciate the process you guys went through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9722)|
| 2:42:06| but there's another step for Smithville, if it's approved, that they've got to go through planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9726)|
| 2:42:13| the site plan's got to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9733)|
| 2:42:15| So you'll have more opportunity to speak into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| but I appreciate the way you guys have really done a great job of handling yourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9738)|
| 2:42:22| and I think it's the way it's supposed to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9742)|
| 2:42:29| Okay, we have a motion and a second before us to approve MPC's recommendation of three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9756)|
| 2:42:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9766)|
| 2:42:47| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9767)|
| 2:42:48| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComR267180529?start=9771)|
