| 0:35:48| Mr. Devlin, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| We all believe Island Home is a great neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| and we've worked long and hard on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| Let me, let me, a couple of things here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| and I'm going to flip to Don Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| We are bound as city staff by the regulating plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| and we've had an administrative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| look at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| And the reason these buildings are at the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| and I may be stealing some of Don Michelle's thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| You've done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| I have, but we'll let her talk about how it got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| and what the regulating plan says at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| Don Michelle Foster, Deputy Director of Redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| and Acting South Waterfront Form-Based Code Administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| The reason we have an administrative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| that consists of city staff and also KUV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| the fire marshal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| So we went through many iterations of reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| this development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| The building E was one of those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| that we had to have several reviews on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| because it has to meet several percentage of frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| and that's why it's facing that way as you see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| Also, based on the form-based code...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| You can't flip the parking lots closer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| and have trees and some transition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| I think it's been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| by the administrative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| and I think that satisfies the form-based code compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| as far as the frontage and the percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| of the surface parking required as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| Also, the regulating plan identifies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| certain public improvements for that particular district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| If there was a development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| you would have a realignment of Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| I think you all have a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| It also incorporates street improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| that includes the sidewalk, bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| on-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| All that in order to provide that movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| of Island Home Avenue to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| to allow for a public river walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| So it doesn't matter if this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| or any other development occurred in that particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| you would have to realign Island Home Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| But I wasn't talking about the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| so much as the mass of the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| that seems to inflict somewhat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| with the kind of single-family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| that's slightly to its east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Even though you have a certain type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| that's encouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2284)|
| 0:38:05| there are townhouses, duplexes, multi-residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| is what this developer sought after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| to develop in that area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| So that's why you had that particular type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Bob, I had sent you some information late this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| on kind of a summary of the different e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Could you address some of those points for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Well, in particular, I think one to address in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| was the role of the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| and the redevelopment plan and use of public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I think I might call on my law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| to answer that question in his specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| We have reviewed the vision plan, the regulating plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| and the redevelopment plan in making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| And let me remind everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| this is the first project that's come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| under the South Waterfront Reform Based Code process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| And so I think we're all learning things on that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| We certainly feel like that all the proper steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| have been taken here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| I'd like to hear, Charles, a couple of comments on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| I would just say that as you look at these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| and I've read these plans over the past week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| with a pretty close eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| and what stands out to you in terms of reviewing the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2360)|
| 0:39:25| and the redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| it is very clear that after reading those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2367)|
| 0:39:31| the vision plan is contemplated as a basic framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| a set of general guidelines to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| to inform the later specific redevelopment that is to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| And there's just so much language in the vision plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| Governor Haslam's introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| and then Mayor Bill Haslam's introduction to the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| refers to it as a 20-year strategy for revitalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| and says very specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| not everything will be built exactly as shown in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| That tells you that it's not to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| you don't adhere specifically to each little item of that plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| the way it's set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| It's just a basic framework,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| and it refers to itself as a basic framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| In the executive summary, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| this plan is not intended to be rigid and inflexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| And in the redevelopment plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| the vision plan is referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| and it's referred to as a guiding document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| It's not referred to as something you have to strictly adhere to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| and that is not mandated either in the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| or in the redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| that whatever ends up being reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| and economically feasible is what really dictates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| what's going to go into this actual redevelopment plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| but the general guidelines for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| are set out in the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| So it's my view that you can read the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2456)|
| 0:41:03| you can look at the vision plan yourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| and you can decide whether what is being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| is consistent with that vision plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| It's an issue upon which I would assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| that reasonable minds could differ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| but certainly I don't view what I have seen in the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| and what's being proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| I don't see any legal impediment at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| to you concluding that what is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| is consistent with the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| particularly in light of the fact that the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| on its face, does not expect strict adherence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| to each little item that's in the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| It's just a general framework for how this construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| or this redevelopment is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| Does that answer your question, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| I think one other thing on the vision plan that just occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| In the last couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| we've adopted the form-based code for Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| and I was a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| I wasn't here while the south waterfront plan was being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| but if you'll look at the vision plan from Cumberland for 2007| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| and what got adopted in the code in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| there's some significant differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| and that's happened because we've talked with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| and worked with people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| and you've got the same sort of thing happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| as you move from the vision plan to the regulating plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| for the south waterfront as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| Vision plans guide you, and they set you in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| This vision plan says it would be an appropriate site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| for multifamily or otherwise, but it said multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| The regulating plan allowed multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| and this developer who owns the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| came forward with the multi-plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| that Don and her administrative review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| have taken fully through the compliance process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| and have made it compliant with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| So what the administration is then saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| is that it is consistent with the south waterfront vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| And is it consistent with the form-based code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Absolutely. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| I think Councilman...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| That would be our interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Let me tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| It's always that, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| I think Councilman Della Vopi brought up a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| about it seems like part of the problem has to do with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| from what I understand in hearing on some of the e-mails today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| that the transition between Island Home and this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| seems inconsistent with what was at least shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| on the vision plan in terms of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| In other words, it seems like one of the things that I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| is the concern of the three-story building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| right next to Island Home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| There's no transition between the R1 neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| and this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| I think that's one of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| and I don't know to what extent any design can still be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| The other question that comes up is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| what is going to happen to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| south of the railroad track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| It's also a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| I think we can let the developer answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| I'll give you a couple of quick answers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| There will be problems developing that back track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| for three reasons, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Access to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| One, through from Hillwood Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| there's not a good access that site from Hillwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| as it now lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| There's not an access over the railroad tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2650)|
| 0:44:12| On the Cumberland thing we'll talk about later tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| those things can be expensive and dangerous to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| And there's a hillside and slope ordinance as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| So you have to overcome all those three things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| to really develop the backside of that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| And the access and the slope and hillside ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| is what really took it off the plate this time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Couldn't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Well, I think the other thing that concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| is the fact that, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| I appreciate what Councilman Pavlis has to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| is that we've got three major neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| that are going to be affected by this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| And we have one neighborhood that still has some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| about what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| And the neighborhood that has the most questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| is the neighborhood that is adjacent to the complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| And so I don't know how that's going to work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| in terms of the concern that they really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| in terms of the transition between the R1 and that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| I understand that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| And some of it's a timing issue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| I would remind you that, you know, several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| months ago in talking to Mr. Gunther,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| we said the first thing you need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| if we're going to support public funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| you need to get yourself in compliance with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| The second thing you need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| is you need to get out and talk to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| And if you do both of those things and things go well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| then we can be supportive of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| And he came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| He got in compliance with form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| and he mainly went and talked to all three neighborhoods several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| And at those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| he was not given any indication that there was any real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| with what he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| And that's why some of this has caught us by surprise as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| I understand where you're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| but that's caught us by surprise as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| But he's been out talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Well, it is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| It's a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| And I wasn't on council when this was started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| So I printed off 100 pages of the vision plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| and that seemed to be the overriding factor of the e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| and the complaints I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| And so I took this vision plan, I read through it, and I've looked for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| and I've asked the people that have called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| what is so offensive about why you're so offended and what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| And I come back to, well, it doesn't meet the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| I was like, there is so much ambiguity in this vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| it could go all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| I could take points out of here and argue for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| But we're not asking to be the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| A lot has changed since 2006 in the real estate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| It's not the same market that this was written in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| And it didn't anticipate the dip in the real estate recession that we've run into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| And so, I mean, do you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| If you don't think this is a good development, do you sit and wait on the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| And when is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Is it going to be a year from now, six months from now, or is it ever going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Is it the best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Is it the best we can do for the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| And does it generally, I think it generally meets the vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| This one piece that they show, this drawing, is just a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| That's one piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2838)|
| 0:47:19| But there's a lot of language in there that's all over the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| They want more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| They want to embrace the people of South Knoxville, yet we want to increase the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| Well, we want to increase it in certain places and not others, but it's not that specific, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| or I didn't read it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| And I think that today's development is not about single family and condos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| It's about multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| And this is where the lenders want to lend, and it's what people want right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| With the number of foreclosures that we've had, historic highs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| and the number of bankruptcies we've had, we've affected people's borrowing power to buy houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| And so we've taken away a lot of the buying public and the buying market, and so we're in a rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| And that's why we're seeing a lot, we're seeing it all over, from North Shore Town Center all the way to here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| that people are looking for rental homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| The rental market is strong, and this is where the developer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| And so I guess I'm, you know, I'm in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| I think the details we've gotten over the last couple weeks have impressed me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| that he's putting enough detail in it and enough architectural detail that makes it appealing to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| and based on what I've seen, you know, I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Some of the earlier renderings were not so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| I mean, from the time we left South Elementary School, South Knox Elementary School, a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| and the volatility that was in that meeting to today, people calling and writing in support of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2922)|
| 0:48:49| I feel like we've come a long way based on that, based on the people that I've talked to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| So I think it's a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| I think it's the right move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Let's, you know, let's jumpstart this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| I think you've got a future, big future ahead of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| We've got to get started, and this seems to be the right one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2948)|
| 0:49:09| Councilman Wallace, you stole most of my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| But I do, I've been very aware for a while, and it's difficult, I think, for the community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| to accept that multifamily dwellings are where the lending power, borrowing power is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| It is also where the greatest need is, and that doesn't always fit with the vision that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2965)|
| 0:49:32| This developer came a year ago and did not get a warm Tennessee welcome by a long shot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2972)|
| 0:49:40| and he's come back, he's made changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| I admire the fact that he stuck with it because most developers, we've seen them come through town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| would have walked away after that meeting a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| But he's made the changes, he's met with the communities, he has met the form-based requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| Visions are visions, and at the time they're written, they're great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| and six months later, usually there are some clouds and sunshine that change that vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| So, first of all, I want to second your motion, Vice Mayor Pavlis, and I will be supporting this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| I'd just like to say, I mean, this, you know, it affects equally, in my mind, three neighborhoods here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| Allen Holm, Old Sevier, and South Haven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| It actually sits in the South Haven footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| And that weighs pretty heavy on my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| I mean, it's their turf, but regardless of that, I don't want to get it as an us versus them thing, because it's not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3034)|
| 0:50:43| Both groups are looking out for what they feel like from their boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| And let me say this, I've had people within Allen Holm, friends there, that are totally in support of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3047)|
| 0:50:56| And I've had people that are against it that are in some of the other groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| So, I mean, these folks are up here, for the most part, speaking for their boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| but I don't know of anybody that's taken a vote from the whole community at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| So, there's good and bad in it, but I think, you know, obviously, to me, what I've heard here, and all the answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| it's been thorough, it's been vetted, and I think it's time for us to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Early on, like Vice Mayor Pavlis, I went to several of the meetings, the visioning plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| and thought at the time that this was a very comprehensive approach to looking at the entire south waterfront development district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3093)|
| 0:51:44| And to me, this does mirror, not precisely, as I think we will all admit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3104)|
| 0:51:51| but the thought of or the vision of development along that waterfront, I think, is mirrored in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| While there are some particulars I'm a little troubled by, by and large, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| And, of course, what we're being asked is the public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| And I'm like Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| I want to move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| We've talked about this for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| We had a chance two weeks ago to vet it, and it passed, as you indicated, 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3137)|
| 0:52:25| I'm ready to vote and move on with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| Councilman Dela Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Let me just clear up one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| I am not here to debate whether someone has touched the base on the vision plan exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| or whether the vision plan is set in concrete and not flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| I'm simply saying that first parcel that has Building E strikes me as the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3167)|
| 0:52:55| where some alternate array of buildings, maybe smaller chunks, maybe reorienting it on the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3175)|
| 0:53:02| would go a long way to modifying the impact on that existing historic community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3182)|
| 0:53:09| And I didn't hear a representative from the developer stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| I'm just curious if there's any other configuration that they could look at or would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3193)|
| 0:53:21| I think the point about the public infrastructure is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| I think we're here to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| But is there someone here from the developer who can speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| Mr. Gumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Mr. Gumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Because the concern was is that it's so abrupt, that transition, that you kind of hit a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| And is there any way to – and I know economics drives any development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| but is there any way to reconfigure that lot so it's less of just a bump to a three-story building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| Good evening, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| I'm John Gumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| I live at 3924 Paces Ferry in Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| What we can't do is reduce the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| The 27 that you were talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Well, just the total development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| We've taken it from some over 200 down to 134.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| And all of our financing is based on that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3250)|
| 0:54:14| Your pro forma kind of evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| And working with lenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| We're quite a ways down the road with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| I was interested in your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| We actually, because of the form-based code, have pushed those buildings to the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| and that particular building was somewhat forced against that street to comply with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| And I was on the committee that did the form-based code, the vision, and what have you, back some six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3278)|
| 0:54:46| You were at that Dogwood school or the South Knox school, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| So the issue is the buildings interact and really front the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3289)|
| 0:54:57| and you have to do calisthenics to get them to do that in the case of that building on the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3297)|
| 0:55:03| because it's not a regular corner, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| So we had to go through some real lengths to get it to comply with the code to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| But the basic part, you know, when you talk about multifamily, today multifamily, at least in an urban setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3313)|
| 0:55:22| which I believe this is, interacts with the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| We are closer to the street than in the island home neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| It's just the new urbanism type design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| An older apartment community might have a fence around it with gates, and it's its own community, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3336)|
| 0:55:45| What we looked at, at least from my perspective on the vision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| was to create neighborhoods that interacted, and they interacted from the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| So that's why those buildings are so close to the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| It's really to interact with the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| and that's why the public improvements are so important to the design, including the boardwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3361)|
| 0:56:10| So we could do what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| We could move the building and put parking between the building and the street, which is a typical project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| but it would go contrary to the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| You'd be out of compliance with the code at that time if that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Are you using the code as handcuffs, or is there physically a way to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| Oh, there's physically a way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| And still get the units you need to make it cost-effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| It's just you'd be out of compliance with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| The code really forces you to put it the way we've got it shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| And what about that Horseshoe Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3402)|
| 0:56:44| Couldn't you face that, for example, the one that's slightly to the west?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| I don't know what that has a name on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| Let's see what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| Road A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3412)|
| 0:56:53| Road A, that's a very charming name, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Could you interact with that street, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| You know, you might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| You might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Councilman Dell is voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| I'm not trying to design it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| The form-based code is a very particular kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| And we've been through a lot of iterations with a lot of city departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| We make some, we can break some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| And this is where it landed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| And to move it to the circular drive, it just can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| We've tried it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| We've looked at options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| No harm in asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Councilman Dell is voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3449)|
| 0:57:30| The circular drive is not considered a primary frontage road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| so that building cannot access or front that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| Oh, you wouldn't want to pour traffic on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| The actual parking lot is accessed from there, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| The ordinance says that you cannot have buildings facing roads unless they're the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| Is that the primary road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| And SW2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| We go SW1 to SW8 or 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| Thank you, Mr. Gumpert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3475)|

| 0:59:18| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| I just want to say that this has been a longstanding business in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| It has a lot of history, and that building has a lot of value to the folks that not only work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| but people throughout this region that enjoyed the bakery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| The building is still of very good use, and this would apply to the façade only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| So they can, you know, be creative inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| I know there's one developer in particular that has contacted me that is interested in developing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| and bringing it back to its original beauty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| And if you go by and notice, it still has a lot of natural beauty there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3597)|
| 1:00:01| So I think it's important that we – I think it was on the Fragile 15 list this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| if my feeble memory serves me correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| So it certainly helps Knox Heritage in their quest of preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| And I would just ask for the support of the council in preserving this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| and letting it long be a part of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I was teasing them earlier, but I asked Council Frost if I could call Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| since he was the petitioner for this, and he said no, I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| So, you know, so give us some information, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| Is the owner aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Has he consented to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3643)|
| 1:00:45| And, you know, give us some more information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I have not contacted the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| I don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| I don't think it's a local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| I believe it's a real estate REIT or someone out of New York that has ownership of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3657)|
| 1:01:05| Again, that's why I put it on the façade only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| so there's still a lot of ability to do a lot of different things with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3668)|
| 1:01:14| But my main desire is for that building to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| It's been there 75 years, and it's been an intricate part of the history of South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3678)|
| 1:01:23| Well, I'm all for preserving historic buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| But to go in without the consent, without any attempt to contact the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| you have effectively affected the value of his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| Without his acknowledgment, you know, if you want to take it to the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3697)|
| 1:01:42| let the market then define that developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| I mean, is it for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3706)|
| 1:01:47| Is the building for sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3707)|
| 1:01:48| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| I haven't seen it advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| By placing an H-1 overlay without his consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| you have devalued his property without his acknowledgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| You've lessened the pool of people that would be interested in buying that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| and, therefore, you have reduced the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| I think this has been done just a few times that I'm aware of in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| to put a historic overlay on a property without their acknowledgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| And I think it has been met with great resentment and a lot of angst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| And I'm just against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| If you had the owner's approval, I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| If you had somebody that wanted to buy it subject to that, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| If you buy a piece of property with historic overlay on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| you understand the requirements that come with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| But to put it on there without anybody's even attempt to contact the seller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| or the owner of the property and get their permission, I think it's wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| and I think it's an abuse of the ordinance that it was intended for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| So I cannot support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| Well, I think that's a little strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| That building has sat there vacant and empty for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3781)|
| 1:03:06| And I'll disagree with you respectfully that it brings tremendous value to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3786)|
| 1:03:13| because it will preserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| There is a group already that is extremely willing to take it and preserve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| and put, you know, if they purchase it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| if this group locally purchases it from them, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| I mean, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| But, you know, it's set there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| And the warehouse behind it is deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| And I think it's important that I take this move because nothing is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3819)|
| 1:03:46| And what eventually probably would happen is that it would be level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| and that there would be a who knows what go in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| So based on the history of that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| and based on the will of a tremendous amount of people in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| I respectfully, again, disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| And I think it brings a lot of great value to that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| and will eventually add to the tax rolls of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| Well, that's fine if you had the permission of the owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| to at least try to reach out to the owner and try to find, you know, get it under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| The zoning can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| That's not the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| I mean, I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| But to not contact the owner and put them under that zoning without their permission or into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| I mean, it's just a you've affected their property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| There's no question about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3875)|
| 1:04:37| And maybe it will help them sell it, but they could have gotten that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| So that didn't help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| You've got other ordinances that pertain to blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| and that you can address it with, and so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| But, I mean, I think there's got to be a real attempt to work with the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I mean, that's what we've done on other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| We've worked with the owner in a redevelopment district or other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3897)|
| 1:05:01| You've got a lot of methods to use to try to bring that into compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3901)|
| 1:05:06| And this is a backwards way to do it, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| Before we go, I would like to ask the law director just to clarify what this resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| as opposed to the actual rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| This is a resolution that would authorize the vice mayor on behalf of this council to apply for the H1 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3917)|
| 1:05:23| Once that happened and once the vice mayor on behalf of council made that request of the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| then you would go into the actual rezoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| And as a part of that rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| one thing that would happen is that the owner would be notified, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| The owner would be directly notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| If not at all possible, then it would be published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| There would be a notification process within the rezoning itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| And this is just a starter, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Councilman Della Voti, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Is this just a starter process to take a look at it where there would be further evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| including owner participation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| Yes, this is just the initiation of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| The process has got to be initiated either by the mayor or by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| It says MPC, take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Is there a way that you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| They can give us advice that might be entirely different than the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Actually, the Historic Zoning Commission agenda is published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| So even if they can't find the property owner, whether or not they can find the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3985)|
| 1:06:31| it still becomes published in the daily paper of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| I will ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| You mentioned the warehouse behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| That's not included in this, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| As all of us, I hope, know, we do have a little bit of a spotty record in this regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4008)|
| 1:06:54| There was one very high-profile structure that had the overlay placed on it by a former mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| and that was problematic at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| On the other hand, there have been some other structures that city council has initiated the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| and it has gone through and worked well for the owner, for the property, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| So while it's not a perfect process, it does work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| And the fact that it is going to go to the Historic Zoning Commission as part of MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| there will be a pretty thorough review of this before any recommendation is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4046)|
| 1:07:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| Council, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| So we have eight ayes and one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| 11B is a resolution respectfully requesting the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| to consider a modification and review of the existing interchange study for Interstate I-640 Exit 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4069)|
| 1:07:55| and the relevant area around Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| Requested by Council Members Dela Volpe-Brown, Saunders-Greaves, Steyer, Campin-Wallace, and Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4078)|
| 1:08:04| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4085)|

| 1:08:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| I didn't know if we have a couple of enthusiasts here that may want to, Dr. Cooley or someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| may want to speak on this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4113)|
| 1:08:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Please set your name and address for the record and you'll have up to five minutes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| My name is Amy Benner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| I live at 402 East Oak Hill Avenue in Old North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| I know that several of you guys were all on the bike ride with elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| I know that this is a cause that council fully supports in its unanimity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| And we're up against TDOT again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| Here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| They're not following some recommendations that the city has made to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| Actually, TDOT came to the city and asked for them to make recommendations on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4146)|
| 1:09:12| And the city gave them a project proposal that included bike lanes, sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4152)|
| 1:09:19| And TDOT ignored that and did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| They claim today that they've spent $34,000 looking into possible pedestrian and bicycle facilities for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| But I don't think they broke down how they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| And I don't think that they asked the city to delve deeper into the recommendations that the city made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4174)|
| 1:09:40| that included a sidewalk and a bike lane on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| So I know that a lot of community members have been emailing TDOT directly on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| And I think that you all's support will also help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| And I think Safe Routes to School is a part of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| We're with Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Dr. Cooley and I are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| And I know we've got several other organizations in the community that support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| Appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4212)|
| 1:10:13| Thanks, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| Okay, so we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| Is that all that you want to speak to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| Caroline Cooley, 903 Wingate Street here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| And I'm a board member at Bike Walk Tennessee and also a member of Bike Walk Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| And several of you have participated in our events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| I wanted to just say thank you for your prompt response to our emails and support for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4235)|
| 1:10:44| And I also wanted to remind you that we do have other partners, including the Knox County Safe Routes to School Partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4244)|
| 1:10:51| and also Together Healthy Knox, particularly the Policy Action Team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| whose the actual policy that we are working towards is having an implementation of complete streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4256)|
| 1:11:05| And obviously this project would be an anathema to a complete streets policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4265)|
| 1:11:14| And so I really appreciate your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| Someone spell anathema.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| Anathema?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| You can come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| Councilman, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Councilman Campbell, you still have your slide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| Oh, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Amy, you wanted Amy to come back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Oh, Doctor Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Doctor Cooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| This effectively cuts off Fountain City from the rest of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| and we're really promoting bike and pedestrian-friendly travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| So, I mean, this is the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| There's been a major overhaul of the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| It's either down Broadway or through Old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| So we've really got to come to something, and I hope TDOT listens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| That was going to be my question, just to clarify that if this doesn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| we've really, in essence, put a dam between Fountain City and the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| And so it's my understanding they were serious about it at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| but then for some reason it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4329)|
| 1:12:12| I think Jim Hagerman can probably address it better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| but TDOT says they don't have enough right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| or they feel they don't have enough right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| Now, they're working with TDOT to try to figure all that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| but certainly it is a major corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| and there are no other options for several miles east or west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| And that's our concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| that it's a very important part of a bicycle-pedestrian network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| that connects the neighborhoods north of 640 with the neighborhoods south of 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4361)|
| 1:12:46| It's a barricade almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| It was like a river, except for it's a motor vehicular river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| Council, our staff is working very closely with TDOT as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| encouraging them with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| so we welcome your resolution on this to support our efforts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4384)|

| 1:23:08| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| This seems to do quite a bit with the new plan, the Division H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| Can you summarize exactly what this does with the Division H plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=4997)|
| 1:23:24| I can certainly try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| It does several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| First, it deals with the interest crediting rate, and it sets forth specifically the rules for calculating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| And what does that do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| The way Plan H is set up, it is designed to have both employee contribution credits and employer contribution credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5022)|
| 1:23:53| And then on a quarterly basis, then those contributions will be credited with interest based on the earnings of the system fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5033)|
| 1:24:05| So that is the amount of interest that will be credited to those hypothetical account balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5045)|
| 1:24:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| And what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| You sort of started off on a list, and the first thing it does is it affects the interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| It does, and one thing also of note on the interest crediting rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5066)|
| 1:24:31| it sets forth rules for dealing with the interest crediting rate in a participant's last year of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| That was left open in the charter to develop some special rules there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| And what it essentially does, it says in that last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| instead of the interest crediting rate that's based upon the actual earnings of the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| then the hypothetical account will be credited instead with a 4% interest for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5092)|
| 1:25:01| Also, the Plan H provisions deal with reemployment and reinstatement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| and it goes through all of the various things that could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| For instance, if a vested member of Division H leaves employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5113)|
| 1:25:20| and then comes back as an employee of the city later on, you know, they start back just where they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5120)|
| 1:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| And I can get into the specifics of each of those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| No, no, just a list more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| That's what I was looking for, unless other members would like some of the details on those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5135)|
| 1:25:42| And that is pretty much Division H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| It looks like there's a lot of information about how the annuity is calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| Would you also say that's what this does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| It also does set forth the actuarial factors that will be used in calculating the annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| and calculating the actual benefit that will be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| And those are also included in Appendix A, and they've been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5167)|
| 1:26:16| The very last under N of Appendix A sets forth the Division H conversion factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| and those were the factors that were recommended by the actuary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5183)|
| 1:26:28| Most people hear the word annuity, at least mine, my eyes kind of glaze over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| If you were trying to describe it to an employee about this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5193)|
| 1:26:38| how would you tell them how the annuity would be calculated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5198)|
| 1:26:45| You ask very complicated questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| It takes the value that is in the hypothetical account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| and it determines, it looks at a variety of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| It looks at how old you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| It looks at life expectancy factors, how long somebody your age would be expected to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5221)|
| 1:27:09| It applies an interest rate to determine the present value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5229)|
| 1:27:18| what that money could be expected to earn over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| It takes all of those things into a calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| to determine what a monthly value of your benefit would be for the rest of your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5245)|
| 1:27:32| So it's essentially converting what you see as a lump sum amount in a hypothetical account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5252)|
| 1:27:39| and then converts that amount to a monthly annuity, a monthly pension benefit for your life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Yes, I'm just appreciative of some of the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| I actually tried to read all the way through this and got there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| but I may have injured myself occasionally on falling on my pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| This is very technical water that you tread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5282)|
| 1:28:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Is it fair to say that this document tries to keep the plan in accordance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5288)|
| 1:28:14| with the Internal Revenue Code requirements for what a qualified plan is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| and that it's not trying to adjust or change the plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| but simply to make it conform to the IRS rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| That is the main function of the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| That is why they were initially put into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| and that is why we have to amend and restate them every five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5315)|
| 1:28:39| and submit the plan to the Internal Revenue Service for approval of the plan document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| In addition to the qualification requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| the SPPs is now presented before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| Wait, the S who what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| Oh, the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5332)|
| 1:28:53| I'm sorry, the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| As presented, in addition to the Internal Revenue Service requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5339)|
| 1:29:04| have these few provisions of Division H that were reserved in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| to be included into the supplemental plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| And with regard to the various actuarial factors and information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| I assume that's something that's provided to you by Mr. Pennington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| or some guideline in the Internal Revenue Code regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| The actuarial factors were provided by Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| Did you carefully multiply each of those numbers out in the three million tables?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| Okay, just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| And would you say that there was anything that you thought was unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| in terms of information incorporated in here in terms of filling out the blank spots of the plan H?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5381)|
| 1:29:53| In other words, you had an attempt to try to deal with that after the plan was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| but to try to make it conform to the IRC, the Internal Revenue Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| Is there anything unusual that you noticed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| No, I would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| I do not think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| It's not cheerful reading for a layman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| You're very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| That's why we hire Ms. Eislinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5413)|
| 1:30:16| I was going to ask Mr. Swanson, but I know what he'd tell me about reading that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Thank you, Ms. Eislinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| 12D is an ordinance to amend Chapter 23, Article 1 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5430)|
| 1:30:34| to authorize the mayor to establish rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| for the operation of mobile food vending establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| Mr. Dellavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| This has been answered for me by Patricia, I think, earlier in a phone conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5446)|
| 1:30:53| or email exchange, but I think it's important to note that we are delegating to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5453)|
| 1:31:00| the opportunity or the obligation to promulgate the rules and regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| My only concern then, and it remains somewhat, is what happens when the mobile food vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5464)|
| 1:31:12| start getting too close to, too near to interfering with the brick and mortar guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| who think that they're supporting the city with their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| And I know that that's going to be one of the reasons why you want the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| But if someone could just address that briefly, because it is somewhat unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| to delegate out the rulemaking provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| I don't see a problem with it, but I'm curious, because we'll be the ones that hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| from upset restaurants who are probably struggling these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| if they have competition at the curb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| And we will hear from them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| Patricia Robledo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Patricia Robledo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| I am the business liaison in the Office of Business Support for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| And so this would allow us to have a food truck pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| And the flexibility there is that we'll start the program and see how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| And so we don't have to come to you every two weeks and have you change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| because we maybe have identified a zone that maybe is not working well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| or maybe we identify extra zones that might work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5533)|
| 1:32:18| And so this is just a pilot program to get that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| Rick Emmett can chime in any time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| We have been interacting with both brick and mortar businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| as well as the food truck owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| And our desire is to come to a consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| We've had public meetings, and we're open to talking to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| and hearing their feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| I know tonight we have people from the Food Truck Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| And you explained that to me earlier, and I just wanted to bring that out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| because this is a little unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| But I appreciate the notion that you're going to have to sort of do a little trial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| and error work and have changes as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| I appreciate that because it is new and different in the pilot plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| Will you report back to us periodically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| What's happening and how it's working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| I'll be happy to, and we'll be happy to have regular meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| with both the food truck owners and the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| and the brick and mortar owners to evaluate how things are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| We have studied ordinances all over the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| and we have visited Nashville, deputies to the mayor, Dr. Lyons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| and Ms. Christy Branscombe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| Rick Emmett and I have been in contact with Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| We went to visit them and saw the program work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| And this is actually that's worked really well for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| in that they have that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| They were very gracious with their time and information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| and that was one of the things that has worked really well for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5624)|
| 1:33:49| And so we are patterning this program like Nashville's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| I appreciate your diligence in doing that, and I just wanted to bring that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Thank you, Mr. Ablado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5644)|

| 1:34:16| subject to approval of a use on review development plan by MPC prior to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| Can Dave, an applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| Now, we have two people sign up, but I believe they are here if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| Otherwise, is that your line on for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Yeah, I just turned it on because I just wanted to ask Mark Donaldson something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| that's in the papers but may not be obvious to folks at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| and that is that there was some concern in the neighborhoods about the idea of C2 having sort of no off-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5679)|
| 1:34:48| but that was addressed at the MPC hearing with regard to the teardown of some peripheral buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5688)|
| 1:34:54| and some acre of land that would allow some inboard parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| and there was a request, I think, for a use on review approach as one of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| If you would just address that background, because that was the sticking point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| not the conversion of this building but what happens to the parking aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| Mark Donaldson of the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| I think I can answer by saying yes, just as you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5716)|
| 1:35:22| There is a condition that any future development is subject to approval by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| under the use on review process, which will expose it to the adjacent neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| which include Park Ridge and Forth and Gill, both of whom had members at the Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5733)|
| 1:35:41| There was discussion about the parking, which is not a requirement of C2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5741)|
| 1:35:45| but it's something that we can manage through the development plan approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| depending on whatever particular uses are ultimately proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| So they will get notice as the plans come in for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| and they can participate in at least that oversight that you'll be doing at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5759)|
| 1:36:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5764)|
| 1:36:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5768)|

| 1:36:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| As I must on at least one item every meeting, I'm going to be abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| Our firm represents the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| And is this Mr. Britton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| John Britton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| He signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| So, sir, please state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| My name is John Britton, 620 Market Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| I represent the applicant, FMC East, in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| For those of you who don't know, FMC East is Fresenius Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| They have built a kidney dialysis center on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| The next step in the process of getting that dialysis center open is to ask for this property to be rezoned from O1 to C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5828)|
| 1:37:18| in order for them to be able to put the building signage that they need to put in order to be able to open the center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5838)|
| 1:37:26| so everybody will know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5846)|
| 1:37:27| So I've communicated with some of you and shared drawings of the proposed signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5847)|
| 1:37:35| Even if the signage were not something that they wanted to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| I think it makes sense to rezone this property given the fact that the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| the easternmost portion of this property was already zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| The property across Magnolia is zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| And it just makes sense for this particular piece of property to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Thank you, John, for sending us the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| And more importantly, thank you for not putting a 40-foot pole sign for a dialysis clinic on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5886)|
| 1:38:12| And I do want to point that out because I think it's important as we go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| and be looking at the new sign or suggestions to the new sign ordinance that this looked like a very nice plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5896)|
| 1:38:22| and I think it will fit in very nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| So thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5905)|
| 1:38:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5907)|

| 1:39:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5955)|
| 1:39:16| Do we have someone here to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Eric Mosley, 405 Montbrook Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| Mayor and council members, thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| We initially had requested for a density of up to 5.9 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| which is allowable under low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| And we've worked with some of the adjoining neighbors and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| and ended up acquiring some additional property from the family that was selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| and we would request a density of 4.4 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5991)|
| 1:39:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| I think that as the rezoning is written, he's fine with what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| This is not the place to change that zoning density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| Am I correct, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| I guess I would defer to Mark Donaldson, but I think it actually is the place to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| if it's going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Mr. Donaldson, help us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| The density would be attached to the RP1 zoning as a condition of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6027)|
| 1:40:34| so what you approve tonight is what will dictate the total number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| that will be allowed within the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| But he doesn't have to build that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| But that would be up to, would it not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| He wouldn't have to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6048)|
| 1:40:49| It's only up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| Oh, it's up to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| Yeah, I was just saying that as I read the papers, it asks for four units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| and there was discussion at the MPC about a neighboring property having 3.25 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6061)|
| 1:41:10| and so I understand this gentleman trying to, in essence, change the recommendation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| but I don't know of any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| Maybe he can give us a reason why we should vary from both the MPC recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| and approved approach of four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| Why are you changing that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Well, it's like I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| We ended up acquiring the old house that was on the property that we didn't initially want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| and we reconfigured the access point to accommodate some of the concerns the neighbors had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6095)|
| 1:41:41| and we ended up with 43 housing units, which works out to 4.4 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| which is, like I said, it's 25% less than we had initially asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6108)|
| 1:41:53| But it is not, the recommendation was for up to four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| And that's what was approved, right, at MPC was four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Mr. Frost, can you help us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| I'm wanting to make sure I understand something here that Mr. Mosley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| because I might have misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| After this has already gone through the MPC process, you acquired more land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6136)|
| 1:42:18| The total acreage is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| We were not purchasing the house that was on maybe three-quarters of an acre with the total 9.85 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| but in reconfiguring the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| and accommodating some people that lived on Creekhead Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| we ended up purchasing that house for access onto Hembolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6154)|
| 1:42:39| Because what it sounded like to me that you had acquired more land after the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| and you were wanting that density to apply to that after-acquired land, but it hadn't been to MPC yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6164)|
| 1:42:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| The total acreage that was being rezoned is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| The owners were going to maintain the house on about three-quarters of an acre of the rezoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| We are now purchasing the total tract, which has added, like I said, about three or four units, which goes over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6182)|
| 1:43:12| It's 4.37, I think, if you divide the numbers out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6192)|
| 1:43:20| Within a half a mile of there, there's R2, there's RP1, up to six units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6200)|
| 1:43:26| There's industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| There's quite a bit of different zonings very close to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| Like I said, we've worked with the neighborhood and people that have contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6212)|
| 1:43:38| We've met with them and tried to accommodate and work any problems out with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| So, Ken, I don't know that I remember having one like this where we can increase the units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6231)|
| 1:43:59| He's decreasing, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| No, he's increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| He's got the motion before us is four units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| He wants 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| Yes, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| He wants an additional .4 per unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| So, he's asking for an increase over what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| So, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6256)|
| 1:44:18| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| We can amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| We can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| We can increase this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6261)|
| 1:44:22| Am I correct, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6262)|
| 1:44:26| I don't know what, Mr. Dawson, what was considered at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6266)|
| 1:44:29| Because you can't, we can't, the city council can't take into something in consideration that was not done by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6269)|
| 1:44:37| The applicant applied for up to 5.9 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| The planning commission, after reviewing the development pattern of the surrounding area, recommended four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6282)|
| 1:44:49| I would say that you could consider anything between those two numbers as a viable option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6289)|
| 1:44:58| Okay, so that being said, I think we need to amend this MPC recommendation from four units per acre to 4.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6298)|
| 1:45:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| You're amending the motion at city council to approve the 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6317)|
| 1:45:25| Mr. Donaldson, just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| They're moving to amend it to be 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| I first need a second on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| Okay, we have that second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| And now we have a motion to amend it to 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Dwelling Newsbreaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6342)|
| 1:45:43| And we have a second to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Okay, so now we're talking about the amendment at 4.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6344)|
| 1:45:48| Who's next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6350)|
| 1:45:51| Yes, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6351)|
| 1:45:52| So before, how many units were total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| And then now, how many units total are we talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| Thirty-nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| Thirty-nine originally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| And then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Well, we had 58 originally with the 5.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6362)|
| 1:46:06| I'm talking about under the four per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6366)|
| 1:46:08| It was 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| And then now it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| Forty-three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6372)|
| 1:46:13| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| Yeah, I'm a little concerned because there were a number of neighbors that appeared at the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| and were concerned about this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| And it looked like the staff and the full commission were trying to have a reasonable compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6382)|
| 1:46:29| recognizing that there were two other tracks nearby that had 3.25 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| And I feel a little bit like while we may be permitted to do this, it's somewhat of an in run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| It really wasn't debated at MPC in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6401)|
| 1:46:47| And I'm concerned that the neighbors are going to feel like something happened that sort of back bit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6407)|
| 1:46:57| I quite don't understand why other than I guess you're going to make a little more profit by sticking in five more units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6417)|
| 1:47:07| I've met with all the people that were at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| Ms. Ledbetter and the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6432)|
| 1:47:13| And what did they say about the additional units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| They're fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| You're tearing the house down and putting how many units in that spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| Well, the access is going to come off of Hembolth instead of Creekhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6440)|
| 1:47:26| Is the access on a busier road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| No, it's a much better road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| The engineering department was also in favor of this revised plan, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| So there was concern about the access road being narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| It was like, what, 18 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| And there was some concern about flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| And they said, well, the flooding and the storm water issue will be addressed when you submit your plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| You'll have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| So you're saying the neighbors are okay with the increase in density now that you've changed the road access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| Mark, do you have any information on that at all, one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| We haven't been involved in any of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| And let me remind counsel, this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| So there will be another shot at this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| I'm just trying to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6496)|
| 1:48:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| So now we are voting on the amended motion, which would put it at 4.4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6498)|
| 1:48:26| You ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6509)|
| 1:48:30| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| I think we just voted to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| Now we need to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6514)|
| 1:48:35| We just amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6515)|
| 1:48:36| What did I just say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| That was the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6519)|
| 1:48:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6520)|
| 1:48:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| So now we are on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6525)|
| 1:48:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6526)|
| 1:48:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6527)|
| 1:48:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6528)|
| 1:48:49| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6529)|
| 1:48:50| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| And that's ordered too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| We have nobody signed up for public forum, and so there being no further business, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6534)|
| 1:48:59| meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil131112?start=6539)|
