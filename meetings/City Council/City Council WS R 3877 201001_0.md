| 0:01:09| Thank you. Councilmember Roberto, would you lead us in the pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=69)|
| 0:01:13| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=73)|
| 0:01:15| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=75)|
| 0:01:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| At this time, we're going to go ahead and turn the call over to Amy Brooks, who's going to be presenting to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=95)|
| 0:01:42| I don't know if Deputy Chief Welch wants to say a few words before Ms. Brooks starts or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=102)|
| 0:01:51| Hi, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| And I do just want to say hello to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| It's good to see everyone's faces on this Thursday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| So on the call today, on the Zoom call, you will primarily be hearing from the Interim Executive Director of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning, Amy Brooks, as you had indicated, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=121)|
| 0:02:16| We also have on the call Deputy Mayor Aaron Gill, who is the Chief Policy Officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| We have also from the city staff, the Deputy of Zoning, and that is Brian Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| And from the Law Department, Christina Magranz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| And the Director of Plans and Inspections, Peter Ahrens, is also on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| So we'll be available to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| Some of this may seem like deja vu since we did speak about the transition rule for plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| But at the request of the Council, we're digging a little bit deeper into the plan development process, providing some examples, and opening things up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=172)|
| 0:03:04| So I will be in the background if you need me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| Good afternoon, Council Members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| Amy Brooks, Knoxville-Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| I'm going to share my screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| I have a short presentation, and then we can open it up for our dialogue, answer some questions for you if you have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=201)|
| 0:03:35| Can everybody see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| So we're here to talk about plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| As Stephanie stated, some of these slides might look a little familiar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| We did go over them briefly when we were talking about the transition rule a couple months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| So plan development, PD, plan unit development are interchangeable terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| Some of you may be more familiar with the term PUD than PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| So I just wanted to bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| So some in planning are of the opinion that using the term unit and the abbreviation PUD has more of a suburban connotation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=246)|
| 0:04:14| which is where it was primarily used over the last 20 years for suburban residential development as it was integrated into zoning codes over the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=254)|
| 0:04:24| In recent years, this tool has been rebranded into the PD to move away from its more suburban association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| and to better reflect the tool that you all have in your code for more innovative development that is balanced with public benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=272)|
| 0:04:42| and used in more of an urban setting like we see here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| PDs or PUDs are a tool that have been around for many decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| The first planned developments began to appear after World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Alexandria, Virginia had references to PDs as early as 1952.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| And in 1962, San Francisco had one of the first modern uses of planned development in their code of ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| So it's been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| And the purpose of PDs has always been to approach the design of sites in a more comprehensive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| So thinking holistically about each individual property or project with the intent of encouraging creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=313)|
| 0:05:19| and permitting limited flexibility as needed in land use regulations but with an expectation that development would be superior in quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=319)|
| 0:05:28| than ordinary property by property developments and also have some type of true community benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| So planned development is not a zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| PD is an approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| So some of the basics of the PD in your code are they're authorized in all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| The entire property proposed for development as a PD must be under one ownership or at least unified control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| PDs are subject to all the underlying district dimensional design and use regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| unless an exception is specifically granted from those standards or those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=360)|
| 0:06:06| So to be granted an exception, an applicant must demonstrate superior design and enhanced amenities as part of their project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| and in no case may an exception to this district regulations be granted unless there is a substantial benefit to the city and it can be demonstrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| So this is relatively new so we haven't seen a lot of these yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| but examples of benefits that might be included are preservation of hillsides or other sensitive environmental features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| affordable housing creation, maybe a new community park, infrastructure improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=391)|
| 0:06:37| or preservation of historic structures that otherwise wouldn't be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| The PD approval process is one that requires a number of different points of input by staff and by the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| and the first step is for an applicant who is interested in pursuing the planned development process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| to have a pre-application meeting with planning and other key city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| So a substantial amount of information is expected at this pre-application meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=419)|
| 0:07:03| Staff will provide advice and assistance to the applicant at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| and it's a time for them to decide do we really want to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| An optional second step is for applicants to submit what we call a concept plan to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| in advance of their preliminary plan to get information and guidance from the planning commission prior to formal application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| This stage also has minimum submittal requirements such as maps, identification of proposed uses, land features,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=444)|
| 0:07:31| any exemptions they're requesting, amenities, and really a formal statement of what they intend to do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=451)|
| 0:07:38| The third step is the preliminary plan that's reviewed by planning commission as well as council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| And the fourth step is the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| So if it is in substantial compliance with the approved preliminary plan, it is reviewed and approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| If there are deviations from that preliminary plan, it goes back to council for a final review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| So under Tennessee Code annotated, planning commissions are given the authority to recommend amendments to the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=477)|
| 0:08:05| for establishment of overlay districts and plan developments such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| So the plan development process was incorporated for the first time in the city's zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| with the adoption of the new code on January 1st of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| And almost all communities in Tennessee have some form of PD or PUD, and that's true across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| And I just highlight some examples here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| I'm not sure if Will has had a chance to send this out to you, but there are links within the PDF presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| So if you wanted to dive in and explore a little bit more about what some of these other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| what their PD or PUD regulations look like, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| But I just wanted to briefly go over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| So Rutherford County has had PUD regulations since 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=523)|
| 0:08:47| They require planning commission approval and approval by their board of commissioners, which is their equivalent of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| Germantown's PD requirements allow exceptions to the underlying zoning district if they are deemed to be consistent with the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=534)|
| 0:09:02| Their process is very similar to ours and does require final approval of that final plan by their board of aldermen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=542)|
| 0:09:09| Goodlettsville, again, another community that's had a PD procedure for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| It's used primarily for large-scale residential developments, which aligns more with the suburban nature of their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=555)|
| 0:09:23| So it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Oak Ridge, I believe that they've had PDs since the early 2000s, I think 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| Their process is similar to ours in many ways, including the approval of their preliminary plan by council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| and the final plan by the planning commission, unless it's not substantial compliance with the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| And then it goes back to council for another review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| Metro Nashville has had PUDs since 1997.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| They require a recommendation by their planning commission and approval of the final plan by their metro council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| They have a long list of minimum performance standards that they require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| A lot of the same things that our ordinance includes as well, such as preserving protection of environmentally sensitive areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=601)|
| 0:10:10| public facility upgrades, thinking about integrating into the adjacent areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| preservation of historic sites, and an incorporation of greenways into the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| Metro council can also establish alternative design standards, which is fairly unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=621)|
| 0:10:30| So now I'm just going to go over one or two of the plan development applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| that have been considered by planning commission and council since the ordinance was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| This is the Volunteer Ministry Center supportive housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| The property is located at Winona and Fifth Avenue, and the current zoning on the property is office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| So BMC is proposing the construction of a residential development that will provide supportive housing services for formerly homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| You all are probably familiar with this, but I just wanted to go over it real quick as one of the examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| So their requested exemptions from BMC were to increase the permitted density to allow additional dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| and reduce the number of off-street parking spaces from 58 to 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| They also wanted to reduce the ground floor transparency requirements to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| And some of the tradeoffs, the benefits that they've committed to providing the community are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| they're going to serve a vulnerable underserved population, they're going to provide this permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| to reduce the burden and expense of community resources for providing emergency provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| for people who would otherwise be remaining on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| This project addresses the high priority need as identified by the city's consolidated plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| to provide affordable permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| And the next step for this project is the review and final approval of their final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| We anticipate that we will be reviewing this with the planning commission in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| They have already submitted their application for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| So Amy, can I ask a question about that one? Could we go back to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=720)|
| 0:12:06| What is the rationale for not doing rezoning instead of keeping it zoned office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=726)|
| 0:12:19| I don't know what the rationale was when they submitted their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| I was only, you know, somewhat involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| My predecessor was the one who worked with them on this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| I can't speak specifically to why specifically they chose this route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=750)|
| 0:12:38| Amy, this is Erin Gill. Can I chime in with maybe one bit of perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| I think one of the important benefits of this model is that it doesn't change the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| And so to Councilwoman Ryder, your point, I don't know exactly what the logic was on this particular parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| but I think there's a benefit in looking at the ability to accommodate this particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| without opening the gate to projects that might be less desirable for that particular neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| So it's an option to accommodate a very particular type of project that achieves those benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| without creating a legacy that the community is not as comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=792)|
| 0:13:19| Yeah, that's a good point. Erin, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| Councilmember Fiegut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| Thank you. So just a follow-up question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| So if the use of this facility were to change, does it revert then back to the underlying zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=807)|
| 0:13:38| for the next project that went into this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| That's a great question. It reverts back to the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| And I apologize. I should have said that early on, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| So if it was already zoned office, you're going to allow it for this kind of housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| If they don't do that, or it goes away, then it goes back to office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| which was always part of what the community was expecting to have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| Okay, so let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| So the next one that you all have seen so far is the adaptive reuse of the former Galbraith School building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=862)|
| 0:14:32| Their intention is to provide a mix of residential, office, commercial, and small-scale industrial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| This property is located in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| It's adjacent to the South Dole Middle School property, and it's zoned RN1, which is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| Some of the approved exemptions to allow for this adaptive reuse of the historic school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| included modifying the base district standards to allow for neighborhood commercial standards to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| And the neighborhood commercial is the most strict commercial zoning available in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| And so some of the exemptions that they had requested were to allow some uses based on the CN zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| And examples of some of those are art gallery, daycare center, a food truck park, art and fitness studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| They also requested to utilize the dimensional standards based on the CN, the design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| the building material restrictions, and then sign standards based on the CN sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| There is one specific condition related to sign standards for this project that I'll review in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=928)|
| 0:15:36| So the two community benefits identified were that they were preserving this historic school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| and this adaptive reuse of existing buildings rather than tearing it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| making a commitment to providing a community gathering space with amenities that included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| plazas, public art, formal gardens, places to congregate and pedestrian and transit facilities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| The condition that was placed on this property as part of that approval process included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| that no signs would be internally illuminated and permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| and no detached signs would be taller than six feet and no greater than 36 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| I'm kind of trying to address any sort of potential impacts from this commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| onto the adjacent residentially zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| So the next step for this project is the same as the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| It's for the applicant to submit their final plan for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| And that concludes all that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| I'm going to turn it over to Christina McGrawns with City Law, unless anybody has any additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| I'm wondering the limitations on the use of planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| If you have a business in a commercial district that wants to incorporate some industrial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1008)|
| 0:16:58| would that be an opportunity to use planned development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1018)|
| 0:17:07| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| It really depends on exactly what they want to do with that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| and whether or not they can demonstrate a community benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| and something that the city administration and city council would deem as an exemption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1040)|
| 0:17:27| that's worthy of the planned development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| It's a very owner's process because of the level of review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1051)|
| 0:17:36| the amount of information that has to be provided on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| and the identification of what those benefits are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| It just doesn't work for just anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| I've lost part of my screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Okay, I'm going to turn it over to Christina if she's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| One thing that we have been discussing for just a little while here is a potential proposed amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| that we might bring forward within the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| The goal of this amendment would have the final plan coming back to council for approval via a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1106)|
| 0:18:35| Just at the final stage, as you all know, right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1115)|
| 0:18:38| only the preliminary plan comes to council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1118)|
| 0:18:42| The reason why we thought that this would be a good idea for the future is because we have to do a map amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| as well to put the PD overlay on the official zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| And since that is a two-step process already involving first planning commission approval to go with the final plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| and then also two readings on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| this will kind of streamline that process and make sure that we have both of those two map amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1143)|
| 0:19:10| falling very closely after the final plan is approved at the planning commission level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| I have a question, Ms. McGrins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| So I'm trying to remember if we discussed this during the recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1169)|
| 0:19:38| Is there something that initiated the thinking of changing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| I mean, I know you just kind of gave us a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| Is this something we discussed during recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Do you tie it to anything there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| I think that in general, our thought process here on this was that given council's direction on the planned districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1193)|
| 0:20:04| that we have been working on for quite some time with the transition rule, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| we wanted to make sure that that process kind of mirrored it in terms of always having that designation on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1208)|
| 0:20:17| And part of the timeline already involves the final plan going to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1217)|
| 0:20:25| And then, again, you know, it would have to have a map amendment at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| And that requires two readings on council anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| So the idea is to shift all of it over to council after the planning commission makes a recommendation on the final plan and also the map amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1233)|
| 0:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| So it's not adding any time to the process because the time is already built in there because of the map amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1251)|
| 0:21:03| That's all I have, unless there are any more questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| Ms. McGranz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Andrew Roberto here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| I'm doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Hey, I wanted to ask you, are you familiar with the memo that Ms. Cuccaro wrote in 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1274)|
| 0:21:22| I'm sure I've seen it at some point, but she's also written a lot of memos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Which one are we looking at here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| The one specifically about the, you know, the conditions with contract zoning and conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| That's the one I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| I figured you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| So has anything changed in the law since that memo was written?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| I recently looked at this as well because I know this was a question that was floating around out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| I'm not sure if it's relevant to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| But my understanding is that Tennessee has not considered a case on this for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| And, you know, of course, our, you know, in terms of the conditional zoning versus contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| Contract zoning in general is not going to be lawful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| In exchange for a private benefit for a very limited amount of parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1338)|
| 0:22:22| Courts in Tennessee look down on that because zoning authority is supposed to be used for the public good as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1342)|
| 0:22:30| In terms of what we do in the plan development process, it mirrors conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1350)|
| 0:22:36| And that is where the local government can unilaterally put conditions on the approval of the project and the plan development as part of the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1356)|
| 0:22:46| Now, you heard Ms. Brooks go into detail about how enhanced amenities have to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| And there has to be some public benefit for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| And so, you know, plan developments at this time, you know, based on what the law is, there is no concern for the law department in terms of this being unlawful contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1375)|
| 0:23:07| So is so contract zoning is not allowed under Tennessee law, but conditional zoning is allowed under Tennessee law. Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1387)|
| 0:23:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1403)|
| 0:23:32| So, Christina, can when we did recode, we talked a lot about not doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1412)|
| 0:23:41| Conditional zoning, so can you clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| The difference for everyone between conditional and contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| And why why this is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| It's conditional, but we don't do conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| Right? I'm not asking that very well, but I think I understand what the basis for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1442)|
| 0:24:09| Conditional zoning in the terms that I'm using it for, I'm using the language that the courts tend to use, which is where during the process of getting a plan approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1449)|
| 0:24:20| The local government puts a condition on the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| So, for instance, and maybe Ms. Brooks can help me with this, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| You know, 1 of the conditions that the planning staff might recommend is some kind of an enhanced amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1471)|
| 0:24:39| And so that would be something that would be placed on that particular plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| That would be for the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| Now, a lot of times, though, I think the terms are used interchangeably, which is unfortunate between unlawful contract zoning and lawful conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1487)|
| 0:24:57| Contract zoning again, though, is where you have a situation where the local government agrees to give up some portion of their zoning authority for the benefit of a private party instead of the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1497)|
| 0:25:09| So, for instance, an example might be that a city says to a developer, we'll allow you to have this rezoned as general industrial, but only if you promise that you will not have parking above a certain limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1509)|
| 0:25:27| So, that would be the example of the giving away of local government authority and zoning for a promise from a private party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1527)|
| 0:25:38| The emphasis in conditional zoning, of course, is different because you have the planning commission and the council that is placing the conditions on there for the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1538)|
| 0:25:48| I don't know if that helped answer your question. I hope it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| I may have questions down the line, even if they're not tonight, and I may have to rewatch this multiple times. So, you've been forewarned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1554)|
| 0:26:06| I just want to stress that again to reiterate that the plan development is a process. It's not a, not a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1566)|
| 0:26:15| So, it really is something that the property owner has to initiate. It's a special process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| So, it's not something that we as staff would initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1581)|
| 0:26:28| So, they come to us to request this because they have a special type of project that doesn't quite fit anywhere or doesn't really, they need some additional flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1588)|
| 0:26:40| So, it really is a process and not a district with its own underlying standards and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1600)|
| 0:26:49| That brings up another question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| You know, if a business is seeking a new zoning and planning commission doesn't feel it's a good fit, is there ever a time the planning commission would advise the business to consider plan development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1615)|
| 0:27:12| Absolutely. I mean, there, I could see where there would be an instance where, you know, someone is asking for a rezoning and it doesn't quite doesn't quite fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1632)|
| 0:27:23| Yeah. So, I think, I think Council Member Parker, you asked a really good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| And yes, we might advise an applicant to consider the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| But really, it's up to them whether or not they want to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| Yeah, Ms. Brooks, what are the criteria for community benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1662)|
| 0:27:50| It's pretty wide ranging. I'll read directly from the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| So, in the code under 16.7 D3, there are exemptions that the applicant, you know, in order to receive exemptions, the applicant must demonstrate superior design and enhanced amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1675)|
| 0:28:16| And then there's a list that says, and it talks about the design characteristics and amenities to be included in this determination include, but are not limited to the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1696)|
| 0:28:26| So, there's some of the things that I already shared with you all, like community gathering spaces, improvement of existing site or offsite improvements, such as like infrastructure improvements, the use of some type of sustainable design, preservation of existing structures like the one, the Galbraith School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1706)|
| 0:28:43| So, there's a long list of, you know, senior housing set-asides or, you know, other sustainability measures that someone might want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| There could be other benefits not listed on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| There could be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1741)|
| 0:29:12| Okay, finally, I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| I tried three different buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| I tried my space bar and two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| I was going to tell Andrew to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| So, now I think during all that, I probably lost my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Oh, so, I remember now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| So, a community benefit might be, I'm just asking, is this what we're thinking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| So, if there was going to be a housing development that didn't quite meet whatever, could a community benefit be set aside for apartments with very low income apartments for an affordable housing component within a larger development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1771)|
| 0:29:55| Would that be a community benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| It could be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Mr. Frost, several months ago, I think I had asked you to look into this and just wanted to give you a chance to talk to us all about anything that you had found when reviewing this, I guess, process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1806)|
| 0:30:25| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| I've got Comcast coming to my house this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| So, because I've had problems, I'm not cutting on my video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| Just to let everybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| So, briefly, this afternoon, I did a little bit of quick research about things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| And, you know, what's kind of interesting is what we use at our law firm is the Lexis platform for legal research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1845)|
| 0:30:55| And I limited my research to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| And as I was typing in my search term, conditional zoning, it autofilled to where it said conditional zoning or contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1860)|
| 0:31:11| So, there can be some close degrees of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| And what was interesting was I found a case from 1953 involving the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| And it was a prime example of what the, I believe it was Tennessee Supreme Court determined what was illegal contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| At that time, back in the 50s, the city struck a deal with a large landowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| The large landowner got the zoning they sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| The deal was the landowner had to set aside about 200 acres for a future city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1904)|
| 0:31:54| At a later date, the landowner decided he wasn't going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1914)|
| 0:32:01| And the city took him to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| And the court ultimately determined that that was illegal contract zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| There wasn't, I mean, the city had bilateral negotiations going back and forth between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1931)|
| 0:32:21| And the city gave up some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1941)|
| 0:32:23| And the developer gave up some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| And that was illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Now, conditional zoning is when a local government is, maybe the best term is not exerting influence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1947)|
| 0:32:38| But if a local government, for sake of argument, a developer is wanting to put in a large development, and it is going to cause traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1958)|
| 0:32:52| It's going to cause a lot more trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| It triggers a traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| Well, the developer might be required to put in a turn lane or an acceleration and deceleration lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1978)|
| 0:33:07| That's clearly for the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| That's a condition for the public good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| But I have a general concern about conditional zoning outside the city of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| And let me explain further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| The state law specifically allows the city of Chattanooga to engage in conditional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2004)|
| 0:33:33| There's a legal maxim that basically says if a statute specifically allows an entity to do something, the other entities that are not enumerated in that statute are not allowed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2013)|
| 0:33:49| So the statute specifically allows Chattanooga to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| So if it applied in Knoxville, the logic is, the legal logic is Knoxville would be mentioned in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| But that's just some legal thoughts on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| But the conditions, if you're going to do conditions, they are more defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| If it's somehow related to the physical attributes of the property, I think those are more defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2057)|
| 0:34:26| I'm a little less comfortable with conditions that restrict the use of a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| But it's a little bit of a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| The things will have to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| So, Mr. Frost, can I ask you to clarify when you say it's conditions specific to the property, you mean like topography, that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2088)|
| 0:35:00| Yes. I mean, something that is unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| In that case, affordable housing would not be an acceptable condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| Because you would be requiring a condition on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| Maybe I'm getting us all more confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| But I've just got a little question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| If you're going to do the either preserving historic property or conditions on preserving land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2134)|
| 0:35:42| then I think what I heard you say, Frost, is that conditioning a use within the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2142)|
| 0:35:52| like a set aside for affordable housing, might not be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| Okay. Well, now to add things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| I didn't hear a lot of the beginning of your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| Okay. However, I did hear you ask about historic uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| And I did hear you ask about open land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| Well, there are different ways to address those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| As Council knows, there are historic overlays that can be placed on properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| That's an example how you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| We also do conservation easements where people set aside, they grant an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2185)|
| 0:36:31| for sake of argument, to the Foothills Land Conservancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| And where something will forever be dedicated or forever will become a park or open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2195)|
| 0:36:45| And then, Council Member Sheehan, what was the next part of your question? I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| That's okay, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| I just said I kind of got confused because at first I thought you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2211)|
| 0:36:57| I thought I understood you to say restricting specific uses to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| in exchange for approval of the project might be considered conditional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| And I went back to my other example of affordable housing set asides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2233)|
| 0:37:18| Well, the affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| Which also happened in CDBG funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| Affordable housing. The Tennessee State Legislature a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| I believe they implemented a state statute where you can't set aside affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| as some sort of requirement. I'm not at the office. I don't have access to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| So that's just my general recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| I don't know if that's Ms. McGraw waving her hand about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Yeah, I just wanted to jump in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| I think that potentially we've gotten a little bit confused on the public good versus conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2271)|
| 0:37:59| So in terms of the affordable housing, Ms. Brooks was speaking about that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| Affordable housing could be one of the public benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| one of the public goods that would begin the process for a good reason for that plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| So that's something really unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| In terms of the conditions that would be placed on this development as part of the approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| in general, they would be conditions on things like maybe the density of the development, perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2305)|
| 0:38:34| or something to do with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| It really wouldn't be a long-term restriction on uses, necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| Amy, can you kind of chime in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Let me share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| And I want to be clear that we are not, you know, as part of this process, conditioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| I'm going to read you part of the volunteer ministry's preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| Their plan was subject to three conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| and they are upon approval of the preliminary plan by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| a final plan shall be submitted for review and approval by a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| and their final plan shall be in substantial compliance with the approved preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| The final plan shall provide site engineering details as requested by the city's engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| and the final plan shall include a final landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| So those are the specific conditions that are attached to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2362)|
| 0:39:26| Again, we're not conditioning that approval upon their commitment to affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2366)|
| 0:39:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2375)|
| 0:39:36| I'm sorry I'm muddying the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| No, these are all good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| This is incredibly confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2381)|
| 0:39:51| I hope that didn't lend to the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| If volunteer ministry or any developer is willing to do affordable housing, have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| I think the issue becomes is if the government has a stick over somebody's head and is causing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| saying you're not going to do this or you're not going to get this unless you do this other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| That's where I think the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| Anyone can definitely volunteer to do that type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| It's just when there's a stick over somebody's head that issues arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| I just know that we need and want more affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| So I was just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2432)|
| 0:40:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Well, I don't know which order we should talk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| I want to rephrase back what just got said so that we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| And I appreciate that we're having this conversation so that we can better understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| I know there's some apprehension among constituents, neighborhood groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| but also I've heard reservations from applicants and developers because this is new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2453)|
| 0:41:02| which is interesting to me, the examples that were presented in the PowerPoint of places like Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2462)|
| 0:41:11| and Goodlitsville where this has been an established process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| When I'm hearing that there are attorneys here in our community that see this as a new process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2477)|
| 0:41:28| that is unfamiliar and untested to the point where they're not comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| So I think that's why it was important for us to have this workshop to have some initial conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| I most certainly don't think whatever we talk about tonight is not the end because we've just begun to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2500)|
| 0:41:47| So let me try and go back and maybe clarify what I think I heard from Mr. Frost and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2507)|
| 0:41:58| If someone comes forward and says, I own X property and it's zoned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2518)|
| 0:42:08| but I want to redevelop this whatever property, existing whatever, into commercial office mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2528)|
| 0:42:20| And we were to say, we were to have a comp, not we personally, but planning commission staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2540)|
| 0:42:28| they present an initial plan and have a discussion to decide if plan development was the appropriate process to initiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2548)|
| 0:42:40| If the planning commission or we as the, even the council were to turn around and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| we'd be happy to let you do that and have this plan development if you would throw in some affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| That's the part we can't do. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| Versus they came and said, I want to do affordable housing. This is zoned office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2582)|
| 0:43:11| Correct. Yeah. And from our perspective in planning, yes. So we wouldn't say you must do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2591)|
| 0:43:18| They're coming to us and to planning commission and to council and saying, we want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| And this is the benefit we think it will have. This is what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| It's not a it's not a negotiation of, hey, we'll we'll put this before planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| If you provide this type of benefit. Or it shouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| Okay. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| In part D, and I'm sorry, I didn't print the top. I just printed the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| So for plan development, it's 16 point something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| Part D is exceptions from district regulations. So if the if the parcel or parcels are zoned office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| Or residential, whatever it is, everything applies the setbacks, the, you know, the height restrictions, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2642)|
| 0:44:10| Unless and D, number 1, unless an exception is specifically granted. So dimensional design and use regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2650)|
| 0:44:19| I guess I'm struggling with how that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| Okay. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| How about bilateral? Like, I'll give you a walking trail on this property. If you let me have an exception to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| Contract zoning versus conditions. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| Answer tonight. Go ahead. Let me let me jump in real quick here on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| In terms of the 1 here that you're looking at about the exceptions from underlying district standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| We're not really talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| A bilateral negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| We're really talking about the form of the negotiation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| We're not really talking about whether the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Is saying that those are the benefits that the city feels are appropriate for this plan development to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| That is something that's worked out through the planning commission process and then the council process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| And then there's the giving away of zoning authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| Illegal contract setting that's where you have the bilateral negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2727)|

| 0:45:36| Zoning and regulatory authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| To a private person, so there are 3 things there, right? The bilateral negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2739)|
| 0:45:45| Then there's the giving away of zoning authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| And then there's the giving away of zoning authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| And then there's the lawful zoning where you're putting conditions on the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| That is a unilateral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| Placing of conditions on the, on the development process, as opposed to bilateral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2762)|
| 0:46:07| No zoning authority is given up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2767)|
| 0:46:12| And the benefit must be for the public as opposed to for a private party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| I hope I'm not confusing people anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2777)|
| 0:46:24| The differences are subtle. I will definitely give you that, but the focus is more on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| The process and who retains the zoning authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| Stephanie, did you have anything you wanted to jump in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| No, I mean, I think that I just wanted to reiterate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2799)|
| 0:46:44| This is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| An opportunity to provide flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Without under changing the underlying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| Land use designation, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| You know, and it really is about community benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| So, in both of the cases that are before council now that have gone through planning commission and counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2822)|
| 0:47:09| To date, those are both cases where the, the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| Or the, the developer has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2835)|
| 0:47:20| Has brought forward something that is a benefit to the community and, you know, rather than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2840)|
| 0:47:28| Opening up the, you know, a change in the land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| It really is about bringing that benefit to the community. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| And it's a, it's a long public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| So, what that council has multiple touch points on and planning commission has multiple touch points on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2863)|
| 0:47:51| Public meetings, et cetera, so it's not miss Brooks and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| And, uh, Mr Aaron sitting down and negotiating, you know, if you do this, we'll give you this that that's not what's happening. This is all happening through public process without a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2877)|
| 0:48:09| So, can I ask a question about the timeframe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2889)|
| 0:48:15| Miss Brooks to understand what the timeframe is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2895)|
| 0:48:22| So, if a developer or anybody wants to redevelop something, and they start this process, what is the timeframe look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2902)|
| 0:48:32| Well, it's going to vary. So, as you all know, so the, the initial is they are required to come and meet with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| So, it would be somebody from our office multiplying multiple offices from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| So, that would take two to three weeks probably to get on a calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| And then they would have some work to do in terms of preparing, preparing their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| So, it could range from, you know, a month, two months depends on, on what kind of what their timeframe is in terms of submittal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2936)|
| 0:49:05| But once they're in the process, once they've submitted an application and say they take advantage of that optional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| Presenting a preliminary or the concept plan to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| So, that that's a publicly noticed meeting. They need to be on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| So, that's, you know, 45 days there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| And then they would come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| They probably it probably unlikely that they come back to the very next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| So, thinking about another month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| And then, you know, if they were ready to go, they probably complete this and within six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2972)|
| 0:49:39| You know, to get through planning commission and council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| But as we're seeing with the VMC project, you all, they submitted I believe in April to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| And you all approved their preliminary plan in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| And we are just now getting their final plan for consideration in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| The Galbraith school project was approved by the preliminary plan was approved by council as well in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| And we haven't heard when they will be submitting their final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| So, a lot of it is these are more complicated projects that will take probably take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| So, if someone has a project and it requires a rezoning, a one year plan and a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3019)|
| 0:50:25| How does that timeframe compare to this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Rezoning and sector plan and one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Like, I could see that as being a common thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| If you're looking at doing a use that's not compatible with the current sector plan and one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| I realize that the time of the year you want to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| I'm just trying to think of examples in my mind of where this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3047)|
| 0:50:56| So, if I'm a developer and I know, like, this is going to really be maybe not the best for neighboring properties and maybe because it's going to require one year plan and sector plan change, because it's not compatible with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3056)|
| 0:51:10| So, I've got 3 plan changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| I think I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| I don't think that the plan development process is going to be more advantageous for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| I don't think that that's the reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| There's going to be an expectation, especially if it's a potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| It's like the both of the projects we've seen there were public involvement components to that, that those applicants took upon themselves to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3088)|
| 0:51:35| And with the BMC project, there was there's more controversy associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| So, I don't think the plan development process is the easier path to avoid the one year plan process that might be take a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3099)|
| 0:51:47| But if it's an easier path, I'm asking if I decide that plan development is the right path or in consultation with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3107)|
| 0:51:56| Is it a longer process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| That's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| Based on the 2 examples that we've had so far, since the ordinance has been adopted, I would say, yes, it's a longer process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| It's going to take more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| By months or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| It's looking like months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Like, 3 to 4 months and that's because of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| That is because of the applicant has not been submitting things, you know, 1 month after the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| Council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| So, but in the change that councilwoman writer was talking about that forever changes the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3146)|
| 0:52:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| So, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| Is it an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| Are there times then that as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| We would prefer it to be a plan development because we're okay with that use on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| But if that wasn't going to be there, or it goes out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| It would revert back to what the community already was used to having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| So, it would not forever change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| Is that the distinction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| In that example that we had about on 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| That it was zoned office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| And if this entity ever leaves, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Does it revert back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| So, 1 advantage to the neighborhoods would be if they could be okay with a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| Specific project, but did not want it changed forever for their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| Then they might prefer the plan development because they like that 1 project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| Am I is that a nuance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| That I'm hearing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| I think that's that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| So, when you're looking at a rezoning, you have to look at all of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Those all those uses might not be something that's desirable for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| And actually council woman, for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| In both of the cases, I was in the neighborhood meetings that where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| These projects, both in South Knoxville, and in Park Ridge were discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3251)|
| 0:54:18| And they were also discussed by the community council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| And so I think that's a nice place to come back and talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| The needs for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| And I think that's a good way to approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| I think it's a good way to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| I think it's a good way to approach it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Um, I think it's a, it's a great place to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| and in Park Ridge were discussed before the applicant went forward with plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| development and in both cases the applicant heard pretty loudly from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| neighborhoods that they did not want the other uses that would come along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3288)|
| 0:54:55| the property being rezoned. So in any case, I think you hit something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3295)|
| 0:55:02| Yeah. Yeah, I was gonna say I think that might be where a neighborhood could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| okay with a project but they don't want it forever changed so the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| development could compromise. So that in particularly I'm thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3312)|

| 1:00:23| I I think one of the things I've talked with miss Welch about is it's it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| like it could potentially be a very subjective versus an objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3630)|

| 1:00:43| how we measure what's the bar and how do you how do you how are we objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3643)|

| 1:01:14| Ryder I think there are a couple things that we can think about and the first is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| that we have staff who will be reviewing these who you know both have planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3678)|
| 1:01:24| degrees and you know have a level of professional expertise and then I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| council will also weigh in on that so there will be some recommendations from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3690)|
| 1:01:37| city and planning staff you know I I would not say that that is completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3697)|
| 1:01:46| objective but I think that much of the work that we do relies on a level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| professional expertise and with with also weighing the input and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3713)|

| 1:02:10| to reiterate that it also has to go through Planning Commission where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| there'll be discussion at multiple on multiple occasions about you know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| benefits associated with the proposed plan all of these decisions are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3738)|

| 1:02:29| resides with based on that recommendation from Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3749)|
| 1:02:33| and and City Council's final approval and so I'm not questioning people's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3753)|
| 1:02:43| credentials and ability to review something I'm just kind of thinking out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3763)|

| 1:03:04| because the way to get your project done is to put up a sign and have a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| and have it zoned for what it truly is so you know which is how how it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| done okay so let me ask my second question that pertains to the same part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| since I just threw that out there's food for thought okay so under state law it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| specifically the power to grant variances is with the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3808)|
| 1:03:33| Appeals and that's that process but according to the way plan development is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3813)|
| 1:03:42| worded exceptions can be made for dimensions and heights those are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3822)|
| 1:03:50| that if I came in and I said I want my setback to be different the process for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=3830)|

| 1:19:58| it also going to be part of the official zoning map as well and if you were to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| to planning cases you could easily obtain that information okay I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4803)|
| 1:20:13| gonna say I got contacted by the vice mayor and she had to step out so she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4813)|
| 1:20:20| asked me to close this out as we got to that point I had a couple things I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| to ask so one other question is are we planning on revisiting this proposed you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4824)|
| 1:20:34| know this discussion or having another workshop on this this topic I know if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| remember correctly I think council person writer had requested the the this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| workshop and I was just wondering if we were planning on having a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| what specifically would you all want to tackle in a follow-up workshop well so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| you know I think the intent of the workshop is to give the council an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| opportunity to you know be an active participant in the legislative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| and you've got a proposed amendment that you've given us some you know kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| preliminary discussion on but we have not seen any language to it so I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| I'm I'm very happy to be here and I'm glad we're having this discussion I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| think it's important but if if we're not going to have another workshop where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| actually see the proposed language before it's introduced I don't know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| we're supposed to participate in that legislative process I don't know if my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| colleagues have any thoughts on that as well that just seems a little premature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| so councilman Roberto just to clarify typically zoning ordinance amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| are introduced through a legislative process we we don't have a workshop for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| each and every zoning ordinance amendment if council would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| request a workshop for this particular zoning ordinance amendment we would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| for mr. Johnson's assistance with that we do introduce ordinances to council in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4931)|
| 1:22:20| regular meetings typically so and you know of course they go through planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4940)|
| 1:22:25| commission before coming to you so just wanted to we thought it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4945)|
| 1:22:32| helpful for you to know that something was coming but it it hasn't been our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| practice to typically do a workshop every single ordinance amendment well I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| know and I agree yeah I think it's very helpful to have this discussion and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4965)|
| 1:22:50| it's very helpful to know that you know something's coming this particular item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| and I understand we're talking about in general but this particular item seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4976)|
| 1:23:00| very complex and might be a good one to have a second workshop on but I'll leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| that to my colleagues the other question I had is I know we talked earlier in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4985)|
| 1:23:11| process about I guess the word process was used and so I'm wondering if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| plan development process is separate from the zoning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=4998)|
| 1:23:27| so are we talking about parallel process processes if I've given the plural plural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| of that correctly it make sure I understand the question are you asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| if there as part of the plan development process is there always is there also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| rezoning process that's happening concurrently well is it are we talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| about is all of this the zoning process or is the develop plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| process something that's you know parallel to but not exactly the same as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| the zoning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| and the plan development process is not the rezoning process they because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| plan development is not a district to some zoning district so it's it's similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5056)|
| 1:24:22| to I think of an example in our historic historic zoning overlay if you know it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| not quite the same but it's in general you know they're both overlays that lay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| over the property the underlying zone still exists so you have historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| overlays like saying fourth and gill but it doesn't change the underlying zone of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| that zone district of that property that makes so it's more like an overlay it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| exactly yes okay so it's an overlay okay okay okay well and I don't know I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5090)|
| 1:24:58| see everybody on my screen I only have a few of you on on my screen so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5098)|

| 1:25:12| chance to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| all right I don't think I hope where's one just go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| just have one kind of perspective and just wanted to say this out loud a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| little bit of I think that the slight subjectivity that it gives for community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5129)|
| 1:25:36| benefit and in that flexibility for someone to do something more creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5136)|
| 1:25:44| than the zone typically allows is mitigated by the additional public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5144)|
| 1:25:51| input steps miss Brooke would you agree with that that the additional public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5151)|
| 1:26:00| input steps help offset the subjectivity in this process yes I believe so it is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5160)|
| 1:26:10| very public very public process the project is thoroughly vetted by the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| it gets to that final plan approval and just one follow-up question I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| I think you recently sent out some enhanced public notification steps or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5178)|
| 1:26:28| measures for rezoning in terms of signage or notifications to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| that I did share out some information regarding our current practice so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| not nothing has changed specifically this is what we've been doing for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| number of years now but I just wanted to be sure to share that with council to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| let you all know that yeah that was helpful for me is the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| notification elements the same for plan development as they are for rezoning yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| they are the yard signs on the property okay absolutely all right thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5218)|
| 1:27:06| councilperson Ryder all right let me ask a more in the weeds question just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| understand so we've approved plan development for two things or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5231)|
| 1:27:17| things so far okay but only the initial the the actual plan hasn't happened yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| because we have one for the Fifth Avenue BMC project coming doesn't got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| that step yet okay so we don't have examples that we've seen so let me ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| you this if something is zone residential but it's a plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| for of a commercial nature and the underlying zone applies so the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| the dimensions so building height limit and setbacks for that residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5269)|

| 1:28:07| setback like a setback side setbacks where your setbacks for residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| are not the same they're greater in some of the commercial zones like when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| budding residential so those are the things you'll go through and work out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5298)|
| 1:28:27| based on what they proposed like if a side setback is 10 foot in a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5307)|

| 1:28:58| would be if it was in the residential zone because if I go back and look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5338)|

| 1:30:37| do that the hypothetical but it'd be right we might yeah it's not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| because an applicant might propose something that they think is reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5442)|
| 1:30:46| you know that might not be what we end up obviously as you all know end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| recommending to to Planning Commission that that's reasonable or not so yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-201001?start=5450)|
