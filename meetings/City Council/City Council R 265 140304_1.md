| 1:18:12| I see great value in what they've done ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| You could say it was far different than it was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| This is essentially extending it for another ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| A million and a half dollars plus the 1,600 square feet at 1022, I guess, would be another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| 81,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| So that takes it up to 1.529 total, or it could be for five years plus another five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4713)|
| 1:18:40| years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| I mean, I just think it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| I'm not saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| I don't know if things like this should have a sunset on it, and I'll just throw that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| out for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Well, we did have the ten-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| It expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| We did talk with Ms. Zinni about other opportunities and where the ACA might go otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| We didn't see anything that really became obvious to us as the next best location to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| make that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| So you think for 28,000 feet, one, 28,000 is the adequate size, and the rent, 1022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| all-inclusive rent, you feel good about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| Well, based on the programming that you guys do at the ACA and the needs that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4760)|
| 1:19:24| have, I think we all feel like the 28,000 square feet accommodates their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| You know, the $8 a square foot base rent, I did have Lance, and Lance can speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| probably better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| We did do comps all over downtown, and I do believe that we got a very economical rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| in comparison to other spaces out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| This is an excellent rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| This has been a long process, negotiating this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| And Lance has done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| From what they wanted originally, we're saving $177,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4795)|
| 1:20:00| I mean, $177,000 over the first five years of the lease, and $35,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4800)|
| 1:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| My colleague to the left just reminded me to make sure that folks understand that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| am on the board and that I'm not getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| So, therefore, the question is whether or not I can vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| I think you've disclosed your interest in it and that you're not getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| I think, you know, with that declaration, you can go ahead and vote if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140304?start=4823)|
