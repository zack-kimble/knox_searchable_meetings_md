| 0:00:00| All right, let's go ahead and call this workshop to order, the Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=0)|
| 0:00:09| We'll have the invocation given by Mayor Brown and the pledge by Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=9)|
| 0:00:15| Let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=15)|
| 0:00:17| Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another opportunity to serve our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=17)|
| 0:00:25| Thank you for this beautiful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=25)|
| 0:00:27| We ask that you would give us, as we consider our various issues before our city, that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=27)|
| 0:00:35| would give us the ability to make wise decisions and wise choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| Bless those who are less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| These and other blessings we ask, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| Please salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=47)|
| 0:00:48| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=48)|
| 0:00:54| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=54)|
| 0:01:04| Ms. Wilson, if you'll call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=64)|

| 0:01:11| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=72)|
| 0:01:13| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=73)|
| 0:01:14| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=74)|
| 0:01:15| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=75)|
| 0:01:16| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| Councilman Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=77)|
| 0:01:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=78)|
| 0:01:19| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=79)|
| 0:01:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Let me say, as you know, most of us have full-time jobs, or actually another full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=84)|
| 0:01:31| job other than this one, and Councilman Wallace has unfortunately been called out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| He's met with the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| He has done a lot of work, as he always does on every issue, and he regrets that he can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| be here tonight, but we have day jobs as well, so that's the only reason that he would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| So, with that, I'll turn it over to the administration, and we'll get it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=111)|
| 0:02:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=120)|
| 0:02:02| Thank you, Council, for holding this workshop dealing with the proposed pension charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| As you all know, because our pension is within the charter, then to make significant changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=129)|
| 0:02:16| to that, we need to go for charter amendments, and two years ago, this council worked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| hard with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I think you had about seven council workshops, which there was great attendance from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| employees, and we worked very closely with our employee reps to initiate significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| pension reform, knowing that there not only do we need to continue to provide good pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=157)|
| 0:02:45| benefits to our employees, which you all know I'm a big supporter of doing so, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| to make sure that we're doing it in a way that reduces taxpayer costs, and particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| a risk in the market, and so we proposed a hybrid plan two years ago that the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| representatives, the employee groups got behind, and that you all supported, and we put that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| on the ballot, and that passed by the voters with an overwhelming majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| So, two years later, the pension board started working on some, so sometimes amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| can come from the administration or from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| They can also come through a petition by taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| Other times, they come from the pension board itself, as we work throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| to identify ways to improve the plan, or if there might be tweaks that need to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| or we find out that there's something that's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| So, a number of months ago, we started working on that, and started working on some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| specific charter amendments, which you're going to hear about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| I do want to recognize the pension board members who are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| I saw Lieutenant Coker stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| So, Lieutenant Coker represents police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| Captain Joe Hackney couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| He's actually on duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=254)|
| 0:04:16| He represents fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Is Steve King here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| Steve's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| He represents general employees, as does Michael Passeur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| Who's here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| Good credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Also on the board, by virtue of position, is Jim York as the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| and he's in the back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| You all appointed Finbar Saunders, and he represents council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| And then, as virtue of being mayor, I serve on the board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=286)|
| 0:04:51| I also want to recognize our executive director of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| Christy Pakowski, and our attorney, Kathy Aislinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| And, of course, you all know the city attorney, Charles Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| So, we're all here to really help answer questions, to present the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| amendments, but then also to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| And the way we're going to do it is the first three amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| you should have before you the proposed amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| and we're going through them in the order of Exhibit A, B, C, D, E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| And the first three, Kathy Aislinger's going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| Those are ones that were initiated by the pension board and voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| the pension board voted in support of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| The final two are ones that, the first one is the beneficiary ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| which we did discuss and initiate, but the pension board ended up not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| supporting it, but I am bringing it to you as mayor in my capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| which I am able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| And then, also, the fifth one is about the expansion of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| So, we'll go through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Overall, I'd say, I know from my perspective and I think from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| board's perspective on the ones that they did support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| our goal is to continue to have a good, strong pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| but be mindful of how costs go up in something like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| and to also show to the taxpayer that our pension plan is run as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| and efficiently and as, with, you know, thinking about cost savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| and how to reduce investment risk in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| So, I know those are my personal goals as we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| First, protect the workers, but also do it in a way that it's sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| And if it's not reducing investment risk, if it's not holding down costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| then it's not a sustainable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| And I want to also say that we have, and like many pension plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| our employees do put 6% of their salary in there, into the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=418)|
| 0:07:04| and that's important because they do have skin in the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| It's significant for a lot of people to put 6% of their paycheck in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| And at the same time, the taxpayers then pay the city through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| budgeting process, as you all know very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| We have a certain amount we have to put in each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| In good years, it might be three times more than the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| Is that correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=445)|
| 0:07:28| It has been in the past about three times more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| And in bad times, like right now, where we're coming out of the recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| taxpayers put in about six times as much as employees do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| And so the pension plan does have to take into account, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| the interests of all parties who are affected by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| and that's what these amendments propose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| So I'm going to stop there, unless you have any questions for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| before we get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| And I'm going to ask Kathy Aslinger to start going over the first three amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| Any questions for the mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| I will say there is a sign-up sheet at the end of this table over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| Some folks have signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| But if anybody wants to speak, then that's where you sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=493)|
| 0:08:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| The Pension Board has recommended three ordinances that amend the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| The first one, which is Exhibit A, we've referred to just generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| as the General Housekeeping Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=519)|
| 0:08:41| And this is the ordinance that makes small changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| perhaps to add some clarifying language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| maybe to correct some various references within the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| And I can go through that bit by bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| The first change is in the definition of member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| It adds a reference to Division H that was just inadvertently left out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| when the amendments came out last year to add Plan H to the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=551)|
| 0:09:16| The same thing holds true for that next section in the definition of plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| The ordinance would add a reference to 1381.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| which deals specifically with Division H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| Again, that was just inadvertently left out when Plan H was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| The next change adds a reference to a custodian as well as to a trustee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=577)|
| 0:09:45| in talking about the general administration of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| And that's just to clarify that it's permissible to have a custodian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=588)|
| 0:09:56| of the fund, the actual investments, as opposed to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| that's designated as a trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| The next section, which is Section 5 of the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| it removes provisions that dealt with the transfer between the city system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=609)|
| 0:10:15| and KUB. KUB has been a closed plan for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=615)|
| 0:10:20| and those provisions were no longer applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| And then it adds some clarifying language regarding some transfers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| among divisions of the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| If, for instance, somebody goes from being a general government employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| to a uniformed officer or vice versa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| then there are some provisions that deal specifically with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| The next section, Section 6, simply corrects a faulty reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| It referred to the wrong section of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| so that's replacing it with the correct section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| Section 7 amends the provisions that deal with a leave of absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| for military leave, and that change is to bring the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=658)|
| 0:11:03| into full compliance with federal law on military service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=663)|
| 0:11:14| Section 8 removes a phrase dealing with the election of a Plan G member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=674)|
| 0:11:26| who has at some point the right to choose between staying in G1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=686)|
| 0:11:31| or moving to G2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| That change just alters slightly the timing that they make that election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| to make it easier on the administration to properly process those elections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| to move from G1 to G2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| And finally, the remaining sections, 9, 10, and 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| those modify the definition of a refund under the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| and there are three different places where that definition appears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=717)|
| 0:12:00| in different circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| But what that does is it says that the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=722)|
| 0:12:12| can specify a particular rate of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| perhaps tying it to a well-known benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| so that that interest rate could fluctuate as appropriate over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| but that that interest rate will not exceed 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| which is what it currently is under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| If someone now asked for a refund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| they would get a refund of their contributions plus 4% interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| and these changes would add a little more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| to that rate of refund interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| And those are all of the changes for the general housekeeping ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| if anybody has questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Yeah, why don't we go to questions after each section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| because there's a lot of information going to come at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| and that way it will be fresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| So are there questions on this section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| I don't see any lights, so we'll keep moving ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| The second, which is Exhibit B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| we've referred to as the Forms of Benefits Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| This ordinance just makes one change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| and that is in reference to the forms of benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| that a person might elect upon their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| Currently, the charter provides under Option D for a special design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| in which the pension board could approve, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=810)|
| 0:13:37| some special set of circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| that might fit the particular needs of an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| but not including a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| What this amendment would do is change the wording of that provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| so that council could specify in the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| additional forms of benefit, if it so chose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| including the option to have a lump sum distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=839)|
| 0:14:03| instead of an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| Mr. Chairman, I do want to just make sure it's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| that this does not automatically institute a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| It's just enabling that would allow us to bring a proposal to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| which might include lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| I mean, so this opens it up so the debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| so we can have that longer debate and look at the pros and cons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| There are some arguments both ways on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| and so that's all this is, is enabling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| Is that correct, Kathy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| It would not add a lump sum option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| So we would move that to the supplemental plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| which goes in place in January or February, is that when you submit to the IRS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| The supplemental plan was recently submitted to the IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Well, the entire pension system was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| for a favorable qualification determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| That process won't happen again for another five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So the supplemental plan provisions can be amended at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| upon action by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| And the other part of the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| did anyone look at the cost of a lump sum as opposed to an annuity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| Does it change anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| Well, we haven't looked specifically at particular cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=933)|
| 0:15:42| Under the terms of the system, all forms of benefit are intended to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| and are required to be actuarially equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| So a lump sum, if it's ultimately added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| will have to have the same present value as a joint and survivor annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| or a life annuity or any other option that a particular person might choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| So if you're looking at a long-term basis over the life of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| there should not be an additional cost for that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| If you look at particular individual situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| there's always the possibility that the person who's going to die three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| after they retire who might have chosen a life annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| and then their benefit would stop could take a lump sum instead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| and they would, of course, come out better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| The nuance of an individual circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| But, of course, we're not looking at it individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| We look at it over the entire system and the lives of all of the members and retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| And you're just buying time, in essence, to look at this further rather than acting now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| So it would go in the supplemental plan if it was adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| This provision would allow the opportunity to have additional options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1024)|
| 0:17:09| including a lump sum specified in the supplemental plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| But it could very well be that after a review of that option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| the pension board and council could determine that that's not in the best interest of the city and the members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1036)|
| 0:17:23| We're enabling subsequent action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| We're just opening the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| The final ordinance that is recommended by the pension board we have got here as Exhibit C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1052)|
| 0:17:39| and we've been calling the Alternative Earnings Crediting Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| This, again, is an enabling ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| It does not automatically make any changes at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| What this does is it provides the opportunity for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| that are within two years of their normal retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| and specifically individuals who have a G1 account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| and then Division H members who have a hypothetical account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| Generally, interest is credited to those accounts based on the performance of the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| Depending on how well the fund does depends on how well a hypothetical account does or the G1 account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| This would enable council to adopt an alternative for those people that are getting close to normal retirement age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1103)|
| 0:18:31| that perhaps would not want to carry the full risk of the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| that it may go way up or it could go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| After considering various options, then those people could potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| if the pension board recommended, if council thought it was appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| have some other form of crediting interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| whether it's tying those accounts to, again, some lower benchmark, a bond fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| something of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| But those details would be considered and worked out in the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1144)|
| 0:19:12| Councilman Delfo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Just as a clarification, and maybe this is for Christy, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| is G1 the one that we had the dispute on in court or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| In other words, there were some people that had a certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| they could self-manage their pension or they could move to a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| where it's managed all by the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| It's not self-directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| Those are tracked individually as to the amounts that are in those accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1176)|
| 0:19:42| but the pension board members do not have the opportunity to direct how that's invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| It is based purely on the performance of the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| But, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| G1 is the one that has half of it self-directed and half of it in the main pot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1195)|
| 0:20:01| Half of it is in an individual account and half in the main pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| It's not self-directed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1206)|
| 0:20:11| Okay, I'll turn it over to Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1211)|
| 0:20:22| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I'm Charles Swanson, lawyer for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| And I'm going to talk to you about the other two that you have there, D and E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| starting with D, which is related to the beneficiaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| You should all have that in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| If you look at it, the real operative section is Section 2 and a little bit in Section 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| Section 2 tells you that it deals with Section 1350.7 Option A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1249)|
| 0:20:57| and that Option A is the joint and survivor annuity option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| That's where, when you retire, you name someone who is going to be, after you die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1262)|
| 0:21:09| this person you name will be a lifetime recipient of benefits, somewhat more like a trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1269)|
| 0:21:18| This is not Option B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| In Option B, you can name someone to receive the additional benefit after the death of the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1281)|
| 0:21:30| or the former employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Under Option B, you can name someone to receive that benefit for 5, 10, or 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| It's not dealing with that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| It's just dealing with the lifetime annuity, the joint and survivor lifetime annuity option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| And essentially what it says is that a member, it limits the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| Right now, the persons that you could name to receive that is not limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| It just limits it to the member's spouse or such other person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| as may be specified in the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| as reviewed by the Pension Board and approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| So that's the effect of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| And then in Section 3, the current version makes specific reference to members of Division A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1335)|
| 0:22:23| Those specific references are deleted there from Section 3 with regard to the definition of beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1343)|
| 0:22:29| And it also says that for the purposes of this definition, the term person shall mean a human being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| which probably everybody thought it meant anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| But just to clarify and make sure that everybody knows that a person is a human being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| that last sentence is added, and it is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| So essentially what this does is it says if you're going to have the lifetime annuity option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| you have to name either your spouse or some other person who has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| under the supplemental plan provisions, which are, as you know, approved by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| So that would kind of be up to you who would be included among those who could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| Yeah, and we'll bring a proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1390)|
| 0:23:12| As the mayor suggests, the administration would probably bring a proposal to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| to consider on those supplemental plans as to who should be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| But that doesn't do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| This just says it's either the spouse or someone named within the supplemental plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| and you get an opportunity to consider those supplemental plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| ever how it gets to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| So any questions about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1417)|
| 0:23:39| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| I think you answered this, but the such other person, there's no list now in the supplemental plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| It's something that would be looked at in the future and either added or not added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| And this is basically the baby beneficiary fix that was in the paper and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| I think you may have seen it referred to in the paper as the trust fund provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| The child beneficiaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| If I could also add on this, there are a lot of, as I think I've told council before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1445)|
| 0:24:12| something like less than 1% of our employees, .8 I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| actually have opted for a child beneficiary or this other type of beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| Most, you know, when you have somebody that is like a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| then the amount that you get each month is going to be decreased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| and then the child's amount is even less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| So a lot of people can't afford to take that kind of cut in their later years in their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| So this will impact very few of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| But what it does do is those that do opt it, it does put us at risk for investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| Again, it's supposed to be actuarially neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| but when you look at investment risk over 40 years of the life of the child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| or more in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| then that's where we start getting into the risk piece that we're trying to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| Some of our employees have raised issues about other kinds of situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| like say a disabled adult child that you're responsible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| or, you know, there's certain kinds of things that we want to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| to see what we might recommend to you in addition to a spouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| who else should be allowed to get this lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| Again, this is just about the lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| So that would, again, be brought to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| and it would be in my hope that if you all vote to put this on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| that we'll start working on this right now with the pension board and with the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| to identify all those different situations that we might want to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1549)|
| 0:25:57| and so that if it passes, we'll have something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| so that we can adjust the supplemental plan provisions right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| because immediately the default would be the spouse or nobody else, the way it reads now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1562)|
| 0:26:09| So we want to have something in place in the event that this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| If this passes, then you could pick a spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| If you were like a single mom or dad or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| and you had a child, you would take the lump sum or something and set up your own trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| Is that what you would do until the supplemental plan kicks in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| In other words, your option is to take and manage the money through the will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| through the lump sum or some other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Well, what I'm saying is that we want to have something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| so that there is an option right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| But if you say we don't allow, just say there was only spouses, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| Well, then in terms of children, there are a lot of people that are single parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| or are grandparents raising their grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| and they want to be able to leave something to their children or grandchildren or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| But there are still those options, as Charles mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| There's the 5, 10, and 15 year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Once you leave the lifetime, there's still the other option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| Right, there's other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| We want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| I think there was a lot of confusion among employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| that children could not be beneficiaries at all, and that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| This is just addressing lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| But we want to have a fuller discussion about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| so we can get all of the opinions heard and the different scenarios out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| so we can come up with a recommendation for counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| You also need to distinguish it from the death benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| This is the joint and survivor annuity option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| a very narrow thing that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| So if an employee were to die, that doesn't mean they don't get the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| They have designated someone who would receive their pension benefit, their death benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| That is set early on, and you fill out the form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| and you say who you want your beneficiary to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| With this joint and survivor annuity option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| that declaration is made at the time of retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| and it's not irrevocable until the time of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| You can suggest an indication of who you might want it to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| but that's not an irrevocable choice until the time that you retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| if you have selected the joint and survivor annuity option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| So don't get it confused with the death benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| which is a different thing altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1709)|
| 0:28:33| I do want to ask Christy to clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| As far as the death benefit goes, if you are vested in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1716)|
| 0:28:43| you have the option of selecting a pre-retirement option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| and joint and survivor is one of those options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| so that if something were to happen to you while you were in employment with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| that option would still be a viable option as what we would apply for your death benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| because that's how the charter is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| If the person is vested, that benefit that they have chosen for their option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1744)|
| 0:29:10| takes precedence over any of the other options available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| They get to choose that pre-retirement option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| and if their choice is a joint and survivor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| and we limit it to spouse, that would also limit that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| But again, they have it for the lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| For lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| So it would be lifetime annuities whether it's a death benefit lifetime annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| or the retirement lifetime annuity, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| So we are talking about lifetime annuities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| either set up through the death benefit or retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| But in either case, there will be options for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| We're trying to reduce the lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Let's move on then to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| I do want to just add one more just to express another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| just so you all know another issue that has been raised by some of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| that we need to look at is at what point, you know, if somebody signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| has been signed up for some length of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| we know that employees that are on the drop and are retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| if they have chosen the lifetime annuity, then that continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| The question is, who would it impact going forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| And that's something, too, that we have to talk to the employees about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| and also get some legal advice on what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1843)|
| 0:30:48| when technically you've made a decision that we should continue to honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| is not revocable or is not revocable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| So that's all still stuff to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| Moving on then to the last one, which is the board membership item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| Make sure when you're looking at this, you look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| if you're looking at the ordinance itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| look at the one that says Law Department Draft 7-9-2014 Alternate A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| That's the one I think that the administration is going to be presenting to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| And whatever date it says, make sure it says Alternate A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1888)|
| 0:31:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Ours says 7-17 Alternate A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| That's the one he's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| Yeah, she printed off a new one today because we wanted to provide these copies to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| And every time you print off a new one, it changes the date to whatever the current date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| So mine says 7-9-2014 because that's when I printed mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| But yours is the same thing if it's got today's date on it, as long as it says Alternate A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| Alternate A is a significant portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| So make sure that's what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| And, as you know, currently the board makeup for the pension board is made up of seven people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1927)|
| 0:32:15| This would add two additional members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| The current membership is four employee members, the mayor, the finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| and the city council representative that you all named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| So those are the current seven members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| This would add two additional members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| Those two additional members would be city residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| They would not be employees or officials of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| They would not be members of the city's retirement system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| They would have particular financial or accounting expertise, which is really kind of the point here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1966)|
| 0:32:53| You would be bringing in folks who don't have a specific vested interest in this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| but do have particular financial expertise to bring to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| These two new members would be recommended by the pension board and then confirmed by the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1983)|
| 0:33:11| They would serve three-year terms except for the first two that would be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| One would be appointed for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| The other would be appointed for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| So you would have staggered terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2000)|
| 0:33:26| So that's really all it does is add these two additional members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| And the reason for it is really to add this particular expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| and to add a voice of the residents of Knoxville who don't have a particular vested interest in the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| The mayor may have other things that she wants to say about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| But that's really what the changes are or what it's comprised of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| and I'd be glad to answer any questions about what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| Agreed. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Charles, does it also eliminate a spouse of city employee from being on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| Okay. Would that be a good idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| It might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I can draft it any way somebody tells me to draft it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| What are you saying, a spouse of a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Yeah, let's say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Let's say I work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| A family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| I work for the city and my wife is going to be appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Is that going to be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| We could change it to say is not a city employee or immediate family member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| You probably don't want it to be a father or a child either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Councilman Steger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Well, I guess I noticed the changes that it's going to be the two additional members will be recommended by the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2085)|
| 0:34:51| rather than appointed by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| What would be the process for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| At a board meeting when the term is about to run out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| there would be nominations made at the pension board meeting, nominations made for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| A debate could be held just like you all do when you're appointing someone to fill a vacancy on the city council when that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2111)|
| 0:35:22| There will be a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| There will be a second to that nomination, a debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| and somebody will vote and take a majority of the members of the pension board to make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2127)|
| 0:35:33| I would like to add to that that we haven't had a discussion about this in the pension board yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2133)|
| 0:35:40| so it would be my intention to go to them and see whether we want to set up a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| Like we have a personnel committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| We have an investment committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| We might set up a few members who want to collect resumes or recommendations from other employees, from the public, from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2147)|
| 0:36:01| I would likely bring a few names forward, Councilman Saunders might, as well as other members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2161)|
| 0:36:09| So the way I foresee it is that we will gather some suggestions and some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2169)|
| 0:36:17| and then review them by the pension board and then find somebody who, first of all, who understands and supports pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| I think it's important whoever serves on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Their job is not, the job of an independent member of the board is not to try and gut the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2187)|
| 0:36:36| because you've got a fiduciary responsibility if you serve on a board to do the best you can for that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2196)|
| 0:36:44| And so it's for somebody who understands pensions, who understands investments, retirement planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| who can add value to the expertise and the interests that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| And so as a group, we would identify a couple of people who have those kinds of skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2214)|
| 0:37:01| That is my intention, that's what this is meant for, to add value to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| And so you would look for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| So somebody who is anti-pension, anti-defined benefits, certainly they wouldn't get recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| because they would not be able to do their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| Their job is to support the pension that this council puts on the ballot, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| Whatever the pension is, the board's job is to support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| and to try to make it the best pension that it can be, run as effectively as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2246)|
| 0:37:34| reducing our costs as we can, increasing the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| So that's the purpose of whoever is on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| I want that to be very clear to this council, to the public, and to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| that any member has to support this plan and work to make it the best plan possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2266)|
| 0:37:53| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| Thank you. Marshall was not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| Oh, I'm sorry. I guess my only concern is that I think the pension board members do a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2278)|
| 0:38:09| And I certainly appreciate it, and I know those meetings are long sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| And so I guess my concern is, I mean, it's not a paid position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| but I think there's something when the mayor calls you to ask you to serve the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| I think a lot of citizens feel compelled to step up and to serve the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| And if it's a board selecting it, I don't know if it has that same sort of call to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| that a phone call from the mayor might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| And then when you're trying to recruit good people that have the expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| and the background to add value to the board, it might be more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| This is just my first reaction to seeing it might be more difficult to get good people to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2331)|
| 0:38:59| So those are just my initial thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| Well, I'd like to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| I appreciate the word of support for me, like that my call might have more impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| But I think that there are other boards like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| You look like the KUB board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| They themselves solicit nominations, they review them, and then they make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| They send some names to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| So there are other boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| I believe the TVA board has three on the administration side, three employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2363)|
| 0:39:29| and they together vote for their seventh member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| I've been told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| I'm not sure if that's true or not, but that's what I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| So I think that the, you know, originally I had proposed that I make the appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| and you all approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| And then, you know, we meet regularly with our employee reps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| and so I asked Mark Taylor and Kevin Faddis to come in and meet with me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2390)|
| 0:39:57| I didn't invite Michael Pasteur because since he is a board member of the pension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| we're not because of Sunshine Laws, we cannot talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| I'm outside of the board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| So I did ask Kevin and Mark to come in so we could talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| and I could explain what these amendments were about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| And, you know, representing their members, they said that they didn't support the additional two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| But I explained my position that it is considered a best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| by the Government Finance Officers Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| I felt like it was important that in order to maintain support in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| for a defined benefit plan, which we have, and for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| where many communities are losing their plans or spikes over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| I wanted to continue to have the support of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| And I heard from you all about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| And I wanted to have support in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| continued support for our pension plan and for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| And so I explained that to the representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| So what they did was they came back with an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| They said, Mayor, would you consider, instead of you making the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| having the appointment come from the board, which would then be approved by council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2470)|
| 0:41:16| And, you know, in thinking about that, you know, I thought that was a good compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| because my intention was never for it to look like a heavy-handed move by, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| the mayor to make the appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| My intention was to continue to have support among this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2489)|
| 0:41:34| that we have some independent eyes looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| because all of us right now are part of the pension plan, you know, who are on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| And the future mayors and future council members won't be unless, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| they're employees first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| They may already be members if there's an employee who, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| runs for former employee or, you know, runs for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2516)|
| 0:42:01| But anyway, and so they actually came with this compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| with this alternative request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2525)|
| 0:42:08| And I thought it sounded like a good idea because I want the board, anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| if council appointed two members or I appointed and the board didn't like them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| or felt like they were anti-pension people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| you're never going to have the cooperation that you need on a board like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| And we have a good pension board and we don't always agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| but we have good discussions and the majority wins and we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| And so, but we often, we talk a lot, you know, to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| we don't usually have votes that are, you know, 4-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| Usually there's pretty much general agreement by the time after we've debated something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| So I want these two members to be folks that everybody on the board currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| can feel comfortable with, that they're there for the right reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| but they still give that independent view and that taxpayer's view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| as opposed to any of us here in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| I guess a concern I have about this is a process in place that everybody understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| because Mayor O'Hara, you're the mayor now, we're all on council now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| but ten years from now we'll all be riding into the sunset, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| And I just want to be sure that this doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| these two members don't become a political football and I see the potential for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| So within the pension board, is there not a way to define this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| so that future pension boards will also understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2619)|
| 0:43:44| at the time this may be passed what the intent is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| I guess, can we set up rules for the process for how this is done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| So we vote on them ourselves, is that right, as the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| We could establish rules regarding this once we have a decisive vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| on whether this is going to happen or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| We would start also developing those rules to administer that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| on how to determine who would be voted on and who would be part of the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2655)|
| 0:44:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Which is exactly what you all did in terms of how you replaced council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| I remember the first time we had a vacancy on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| and it hadn't happened for years and years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Nobody knew how that was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| And then over time, there were more and more vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| And as that happened over time, you developed a really, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| a nicely functioning plan for how you fill those vacancies on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| that gives a lot of public input, that gives everybody an opportunity to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| that really accomplishes the mission that you want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| But that didn't happen automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| That wasn't something that happened right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| That's something that you all developed over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| as you determined what worked well and what didn't work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| And from what I've seen of this pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| they're a highly functioning unit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| And I think they have the capacity to develop those rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| and have an understanding of what it would be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| And I think they would put together a good set of rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| to establish the membership in a reasonable way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Councilman DelaVolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Just a clarification, Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| The first three, A through C, were, I guess, the board and administration agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| Why isn't there agreement or is there agreement on E here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| the additional board members, since they're choosing the people to recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| I don't understand why they're not saying we want this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| What's the objection, I guess, is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I'm not sure I'm the right person to answer that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| although I did attend a board meeting where it was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| Council wasn't put to a vote at a pension board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| The administration sent this ordinance to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| under the provisions of the charter that provide you send something to the board in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| and ask them for a recommendation with regard to form and effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| In other words, is it in the proper form to take to council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| and what effect would it have on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| We did that, and you see their comments in the draft report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2784)|
| 0:46:28| that has been submitted to you tonight with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| Obviously, there are folks here who believe that this is not the right thing to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| in terms of adding additional members to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| and they probably would be better to articulate that position than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2800)|
| 0:46:44| and I suspect if you wait just a few minutes, you'll hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| I didn't know if you hadn't yet addressed to the board the change that was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| when you talked to Mr. Faddis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| I did share that with the board at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| They still would rather not have an expanded board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| I would say it's probably a fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Actually, we had one member of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| He's not here tonight, so I hate to speak for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| but Joe Hackney said that he felt that with this change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| with the change in this, the alternate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| he could sell that to his fellow firefighters was his statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| so I think that's a fair statement, what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| Ms. Christian, are you reaching for the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| Do you like me to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| She can address some of the opposing viewpoints to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| I think the concern was also what Councilman Steyer had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| was that the recommendations and having the pool of people with the expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| to be volunteering to do this for the board would be a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| and there's a lot of best practices that GFOA recommends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| and part of that recommendation is to put how many members are on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2891)|
| 0:48:18| and what the makeup of the board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| and there's also other recommendations as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| including putting a retiree member on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| which if we would recommend this, that's what I would recommend personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| as a professional to this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| is that it would be one member from outside and then maybe a retiree as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| but that's not what the ordinance has to say right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| but there's just been some concern about how that would appear as well to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2929)|
| 0:48:59| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| Charles, the two board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| are they term limited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| It says the board member elected by Council of the City of Nassau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| shall serve a three-year term and shall be elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Is there anything in here that says that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| It doesn't provide for a term limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2958)|
| 0:49:29| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Yes, Mr. Swanson, in terms of the public input to the board, if it's expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2970)|
| 0:49:39| what would we have to write some language in to ensure that public input during the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2979)|
| 0:49:48| How would that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Well, the pension board is a public meeting that's open to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and certainly the public can come and offer their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| The public can always, in advance of meetings, communicate with the members of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| There are plenty of ways to communicate thoughts with regard to the membership of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| or the potential new board members to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I don't perceive that as being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| I'm sure you could create some type of structured form for doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| but I don't really know that it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| Is there further questions or follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| Any closing statements from the administration before we go to the public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Well, if we've identified one of the potential problems for the two new board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3038)|
| 0:50:46| with financial expertise or accounting expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| and if the problem that you're suggesting is that the pool in Knoxville may be too shallow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| that we may not have enough people in Knoxville to fill those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| I have to say to you I think in a city of 185,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| I think there are probably people who fit the description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| and plenty of people who would be willing to serve who fit this description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| and who could bring that expertise to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| So you've had some good thoughts and suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| and I've made some notes about potential tweaks we might make to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| before we actually bring it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| But in terms of whether this is a good idea or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| the only thing that I've heard with regard to the shallow pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| I just don't believe that that's a problem that could not be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Madam Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| I'll conclude by saying that I appreciate council considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| Again, with both the child beneficiary or the beneficiary ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| and the additional board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| my intention is to be able to maintain public and council support for the plans that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3118)|
| 0:52:08| to show that we do have a responsible plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3128)|
| 0:52:12| that we continue to provide excellent benefits for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| at the same time that we're taking risks to reduce long-term risk to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| I've been very clear with council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| and a majority of council is very consistently in support of our pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| and our employees on these types of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| and I intend to continue that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| and I hope we continue to have council support on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| But I do think these two changes are something that will help us in the long run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3161)|
| 0:52:46| to continue to have a good plan, support our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| and also address taxpayer interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| And public support, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| We've got five folks that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3177)|
| 0:53:01| It'll be just like at a regular council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| I'll call your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3183)|
| 0:53:04| If you'll come down and give your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| and you have five minutes to address the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| First up is Anita Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3189)|
| 0:53:32| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Anita Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| City of Knoxville, general government retiree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| I don't know where to start, and you all know me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| and I'm not one to beat around the bush about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| but this whole issue came about because of high-paid folks making their children their beneficiaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3228)|
| 0:54:00| Prior to the implementation, development, and approval of Plan G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| no mayor, no city council member, no director, no secretary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3245)|
| 0:54:12| no part-time employee that did not have civil service status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| could even participate in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| Most of these people that work for the city do not make what directors make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3260)|
| 0:54:29| and that's how this all got started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| When Plan H was created and approved by the voters a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3280)|
| 0:54:42| city council opted not to be included in the pension participation any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3282)|
| 0:54:50| This is real easy to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| All you've got to do is tell them they're not going to participate anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| and let the voters approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| It's real simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| You're a civil service employee, you've got to participate in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| If you're not, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| It's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| I was glad, though, to hear that there are going to be extenuating circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| to allow for the provision of certain individuals not having to be a spouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3316)|
| 0:55:24| to be a lifetime beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| That was one of my big concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3327)|
| 0:55:28| and I believe I heard Mayor Rojero say that she would work with the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3328)|
| 0:55:34| to develop supplemental rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| and I believe that you used specifically adult children who needed someone to care for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3336)|
| 0:55:45| Just to be clear, that was one of the things that had been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| We haven't made a recommendation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| That was one of my concerns as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| and I just wanted to make sure that the city was aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| As to the number of members of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| until city council was allowed to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| city council didn't even have a representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| Retirees still don't have a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| though I am glad to hear the executive director say she does feel a need for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| and maybe one of us will finally get in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| and hopefully I'll get elected to that position too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| But I just wanted to say I'm quite concerned that we need to have citizens on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3379)|
| 0:56:29| I understand the need for it, but don't say it's to have financial expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| when in 2013 the fund paid out $1,097,461 for money managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3394)|
| 0:56:44| That's what it said in the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| February of this year, that's what the minutes said for last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3406)|
| 0:56:51| Year-to-date for 2014, the fund has paid out $650,755 to five money managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3411)|
| 0:57:04| That's over half a million dollars in the first quarter of 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3424)|
| 0:57:11| So I'm really not sure why we have that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Most of the other things, I think you have some good ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| but I think you're rushing into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| I've heard several of the council members say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| well, what's going to be the plan for these new council members if this goes on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| Well, how are these supplemental regulations going to be developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| You need to slow down, you need to take a big look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| and there may be other amendments you need to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| to get some of these high-dollar people out of the pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| and that will solve a lot more of your problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| Michael Pursuer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3465)|
| 0:57:51| I'm Michael Pursuer, 1400 Lorain Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| I'm the president of the City Employees Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| and also a sitting board member on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Just a couple of things I want to address with regard to the proposed ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| one of them being about the beneficiaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| The concern that I have in my constituents that placed me on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| and also into the City Employees Association presidency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| is we have a letter from our actuary that said that this is cost neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| which means it has no impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| I think at the end of each one of these draft ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| the financial impact is spelled out, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3507)|
| 0:58:31| And in all those, I believe it was zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| So we're looking at going to the ballot with things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| we're talking about the impact to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| and certainly as employees of the city and a member of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| I am concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| I'm a steward of the taxpayers' dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| I'm concerned about how those things are handled and how that's managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3530)|
| 0:58:55| But if it doesn't have a financial impact, why are we addressing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| And then secondly, when talking about expanding the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| I want to make sure that one of my biggest concerns with all of this is addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| and that is the information we get out to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| As I was going back doing some research on some other things that we've done as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| I was looking at the concrete canopies that were once upon Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| Do you remember those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| Those were put up in, what, the 50s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| And then they were taken down in the 80s because 30 years later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| the people decided that what they voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| and the city money that was spent wasn't such a good idea after all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| Voter's remorse, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| Just in the April 1st city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| you voted to pay $42,600 for some solar lights to illuminate the dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| Are people going to think that's a good investment and a good choice for voters 30 years from now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| Have we educated them on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| The same kind of information concerns me with adding and expanding the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| Everything that has been done charter-wise that affects this pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3601)|
| 1:00:08| and the spending and the plans and who can participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| has all gone before the voters at some point in time or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Back when Victor Ashe was the mayor, and he was also the chairman of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| it seemed like a good idea to include the mayor and the city council in the pension plan, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3620)|
| 1:00:27| And apparently the voters thought so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Once they saw how that all played out, then all of a sudden people were concerned with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| I'm concerned that we do the right thing, that we educate the voters, that we are educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3634)|
| 1:00:42| Even tonight there's been questions concerning what is death beneficiary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| and what is lifetime beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| This kind of clarification, I want to make sure that the information we get out to the public is clear and concise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| We already have investment strategists, as Anita pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| We have lawyers, we have fund managers, we have actuaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| and we have a finance director that has been recognized in the Fitch Ratings as us having a sound plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| And it's by his leadership in several administrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| that good financial and fiscal decisions have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| We have professionals in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Every month when we meet there's an item on the agenda for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| And not once have I, since I've been sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| and in the minutes and records that I've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| has someone come forward from the public to share their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| In 2010, a 13-member task force was named,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3692)|
| 1:01:36| and there were people with all varying degrees and backgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| very learned, qualified, and educated people that got together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| and in their final report there just wasn't a whole lot of impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| There wasn't a whole lot of information that made any sweeping changes to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| So I want to make sure that the information that we get out to the public is clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| it's concise, and they understand the magnitude of these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3715)|
| 1:02:00| The people that work here all day every day and invest their 6% are very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| They know how important this is, but they get turned around and twisted in the terminology too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3725)|
| 1:02:12| It's not going to be hard to find two people from the public that are more intelligent than I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| but I have a lot invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| I have time invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| I have money invested, just like every one of these people that I work alongside every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| and serve this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I just want to make sure that they've got that going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| and that people understand exactly what they're voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3751)|
| 1:02:54| Harold or Harold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Harold or Harold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Thank you, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| My name's Buddy Harold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| I live at 3336 Clear Springs Road in Mascot, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| I'm a 39-year employee currently on the drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| I'll be ending my career here, good Lord's will, on the last day of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3796)|
| 1:03:22| It's been a great career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| It's been a wonderful experience serving the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3804)|
| 1:03:28| And I also have set, I believe it's four terms on the pension board prior to Michael sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3808)|
| 1:03:39| He addressed several of the issues that I wanted to bring to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3819)|
| 1:03:47| In my terms there, I didn't miss, thanks to the higher power, I was able to attend every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3827)|
| 1:03:56| I didn't miss one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| I don't say that for credibility, but I say that not one time did I experience anyone from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3837)|
| 1:04:06| coming to any of those meetings to have input, to ask questions, to have any concerns voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3846)|
| 1:04:14| I expressed the other day to Mayor and Counsel Sanders at the board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3854)|
| 1:04:21| that they are the ear and the voice of the public that are represented on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3861)|
| 1:04:29| The structure of that board, in my view, doesn't need to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| It's very sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| It's worked very efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| I share with Michael that some very, in my view, not very sound information gets out to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3876)|
| 1:04:48| The media is able to pick and choose what they put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| They are able to put out there some things that sitting on that board I disagree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| We have a letter, I think it's in your possession, from Alan Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| Pay close attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| As you all know, I hope you do, it's our actuary for the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| I have all the confidence in the world in how that board is structured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| and Alan's opinions and assumptions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| We have, as Michael said, we have legal advice and it's paid outside of legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| We have investment advice, very solid investment advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| and we have an executive director sitting there to offer us advice and opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3940)|
| 1:05:48| That was the advice as I addressed the board the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| When I first took my seat there, I knew very little, as Michael said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| You wouldn't have to look very far to find someone financially more intelligent than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3955)|
| 1:06:05| The instructions was given to me, follow your legal advice, your investment advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| and your executive director at the time was Mike Cherry, and you'll make right decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| One other topic that I want to touch, and I'll sit down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| but in the beneficiary topic I'm very concerned with that for the matter of who might make the election of who that person is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3982)|
| 1:06:38| any such other person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| Be careful when you consider that, that the employee's perception here is some of the perception that I've gathered is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4000)|
| 1:06:56| feels like that their blood kin and who they put on that beneficiary statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4016)|
| 1:07:06| is something that they're very concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| As I believe the mayor said, it's a very low percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| It's worked for many years, so thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4033)|
| 1:07:20| Chairman, we don't have the letter that he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| It says it's attached, but it's not in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| Well, won't we, I'll get the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| We can get it sent to you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| The pension board can send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4056)|
| 1:07:45| Greg Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| I'm Greg Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| My address is 7714 Norris Freeway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| I work for the Knoxville Police Department, and I'm vice chair of the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| I'd like to talk to you, first of all, thank you for letting me speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| but I'd like to talk about the two ordinance suggestions that were not supported by the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| first being the joint survivor annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| And when it said that we didn't support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| I understand that what we didn't support was it going forward right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| In June, and I participated by phone because I was on vacation, when we had the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| it became more and more evident that this may or may not be detrimental to the fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| And let me put it in context for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| The one that brought this up initially and brought this whole thing before the board was me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| I knew that this had been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| I was concerned that if it was done a lot, it could affect the corpus of the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| and it could have detrimental effect on the future pension benefits for the pensioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| It became evident through the lengthy conversations that we had that that may or may not be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| And folks, to be honest with you, I still don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| Alan Pennington in the May meeting said, for us not to worry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| said it was really not going to affect it like we were afraid it was going to affect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Now, that's Mr. Pennington, who is the actuary for the city and the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| We have to take that advice pretty seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| In addition to that, and I didn't know this percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| but the mayor said that it's only .8 percent of the employees that have done this so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| that have taken advantage of leaving this benefit further than your spouse or just one generation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| That's a very, very small percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| Mr. Passore brought up in June, because he's done some looking at the salary ranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| there's not that many employees that could actually take advantage of this monetarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| So as we continue to talk about it, and again in June I asked that this not go before a vote yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| that we continue to look at it and see if it is the problem that I initially perceived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4192)|
| 1:09:57| or if it's a non-issue that we're addressing just to address something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| The vote went forward anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| It was split because while I could attend and debate by phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| I could not vote electronically, which was by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| So it didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| So what I'm asking now for this particular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| is that it be left in our hands to continue to look at and see if it is the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| If it is, folks, I'll be the first one to tell you my fiduciary responsibility to that fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| is trumped by nothing else when I'm sitting at that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| I'll bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| But I'm not so sure that it is the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| and I haven't seen anything that says that it is the issue presented to you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| and I'm not sure that there's enough concrete evidence one way or the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| that can have any of us decide before this has to come in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| If it can, maybe we'll find it and maybe you'll get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| But if it doesn't, in two years we can bring it back if it is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| This is a 30- to 50-year thing we're in with this pension stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| It's not an immediate right now do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| So I ask that you let the board continue to research this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| and continue to see whether or not this is the issue that I initially perceived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| because I'm just not sure it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| As to the second one that's questionable, and that's expanding the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| the makeup of the board, in my opinion, is pretty strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| And what do I mean by strong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| We have a finance director, Jim York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| He's a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Our pension executive director, Mr. Pakowski, is a CPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| Mr. Finbar Saunders, who initially I wasn't crazy about being on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| but I sure am glad you all put him on the board, he's retired from the banking industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| He was a banking VP, a vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| We have an investment committee that is made up of, includes Mr. Saunders and Mr. York,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| and they vet all the things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| In addition to that, the mayor sits on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4325)|
| 1:12:10| That's kind of the highest guidance we can get in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Along with that, we have summit strategies out of St. Louis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| at one time one of the top three in the nation and beyond in financial advising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| You have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| I'm not sure what expertise we can find outside of what we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4345)|
| 1:12:31| that will be significant enough to outweigh what we already have on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you for letting me speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4360)|
| 1:12:52| Mark Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| I'm the president for the Fraternal Order of Police Volunteer Watch No. 2, 720 Hall of Fame Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4373)|
| 1:12:59| Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4379)|
| 1:13:04| I want to express to you some of the concerns that have been raised to me by employees by that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4384)|
| 1:13:08| and some of my concerns with particularly the last two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4388)|
| 1:13:18| Generally, it makes me uneasy if we go forward with something that removes something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4398)|
| 1:13:25| that an employee may have elected many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| In a particular case, one of the options that would be removed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| from my understanding, it would remove the pre-retirement options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| that employees have made maybe 10 or 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| I think that is dicey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| I think it's kind of dicey legally, and it may or may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4424)|
| 1:13:49| I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| I don't profess to be, but I'm a pretty reasonable guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| I think if a guy's operated under the assumption that something that he chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| and planned for that many years ago is, to me, it should be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4441)|
| 1:14:09| The one problem I see is with removing it without defining that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| or honoring that on the front end is it has the effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| And folks still don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| You ask two or three different people, you get two or three different answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| But from what I'm hearing, it would have the effect of removing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4464)|
| 1:14:29| So that is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| That's a concern of some of our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| It's a very small percentage of our employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| but I think it's a valid concern that needs to be addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| preferably before we go forward and pass something that allows a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| that removes the thing we're discussing in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| So that part of it's a concern for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| Initially, the employee perception of adding a couple people to the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4492)|
| 1:14:59| was not positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| My perception of that wasn't very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| And I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| The board, and I have no doubt about it, does an excellent job managing our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4507)|
| 1:15:14| And the big responsibility is to grow that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| and to manage it and make decisions long-term that are in the interest of paying those benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| and reducing taxpayer liability, making the pension sound for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| for the folks that are in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| And other folks have told you, you know, we've got Jim York on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| we've got the mayor on there, we've got Finbar on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| We pay guys that continually make above our returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| That's why we're in as good a shape as we're in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| During the pension task force meeting, our pension system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| during the discussion there, and you can go back to the minutes of it and watch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| every expert that came and spoke before that body said that we were one of the top in the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4556)|
| 1:16:04| best managed pension plans in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| I don't know that adding people to that would automatically change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| But I know that up until now, from everything that I've heard from the people who are experts in that field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| that we already are at that level of financial advice on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| It would concern me just to appoint people because the employees would have a perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| that maybe the board was being co-opted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| And I did talk to the mayor about that and expressed those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| It would be our preference, I think it would be the preference of the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| that there weren't folks added to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| If it's your decision in the end to add folks to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| then I think it's vitally important that the employees, the employee reps that have been voted on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4619)|
| 1:17:08| to serve on the pension board have that say or have some say in that process to make it valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| Okay, there's no other business to come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| Any other further comments from Council before we adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Tim Barr, you look, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Thanks, everybody, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877140717?start=4649)|
