| 0:03:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=196)|

| 0:03:25| Councilman Delafoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Mr. Mayor, before we vote on the 12A, B, and C, is Cindy going to read us a list of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=206)|
| 0:03:36| items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Because some people want to know when we're spending city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| We'll ask her to do that, if she doesn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| 12A is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $750 from the Community Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| to Redeeming Hope Ministries, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| 12B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $1,500 from the Community Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| and donating the same to North Knoxville Business and Professionals Association, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| 12C is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $300 from the Community Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| and making said funds available to the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=259)|
| 0:04:29| I have the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| I have a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| First is on the backdoor pickup service change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| The City of Knoxville wants to remind citizens that a change is coming for approximately 25 percent of the city's garbage customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=279)|
| 0:04:49| The change was announced in April for households that do not take their garbage to the curb every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| Starting in October, the city will no longer provide this backdoor service at no charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=295)|
| 0:05:03| except for those with a medical need or those who are over the age of 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| Applications for backdoor service require either proof of age over 75| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=309)|
| 0:05:15| or for a doctor to complete the form verifying the medical need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| And those forms are available by calling 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| And the applications must be turned in to the city by the September 1 deadline to have no interruption in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=325)|
| 0:05:35| Also, I would like to introduce Will Parrott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=335)|
| 0:05:39| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| I'll tell you a little about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| You can come down if you want to greet us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| He's the new University of Tennessee Student Government Association City of Knoxville license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| Will plans to attend city council meetings this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| and will facilitate communication with the Student Government Association and the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| We appreciate the students at UT and Will's efforts to make sure we have good lines of communication with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| And you're welcome to greet us at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| I just want to say I'm really excited about this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| I think we have the executive board of the Student Government Association has a lot of good people on it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=372)|
| 0:06:19| And I think we're going to get a lot accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=379)|
| 0:06:22| So I'm really excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| And how do you classify, young man?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=387)|
| 0:06:28| Are you a senior this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| I'm senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| This is my last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=392)|
| 0:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| And also we want to make note of retirement of someone who's been with us for quite some time, Rebecca Farrar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=394)|
| 0:06:41| She has been covering the city government for the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| She's going to retire at the end of the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| But this is her last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| I know you all will join me in wishing Rebecca a great retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Let's give her a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=414)|
| 0:07:10| Rebecca, did you want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| You're more than welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=433)|
| 0:07:21| I just want to say thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| And it's been really interesting covering you guys, especially coming from county commission to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| You know, there just weren't any scandals over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| As hard as I looked, I couldn't find anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| I want to thank you all and enjoy covering you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| You all called me back when I needed you, and I appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Thank you, Rebecca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| You've done an excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| Are there any reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Vice Mayor Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| First of all, Councilman Woodhull wanted me to relay the message that he's out of town on business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| and regrets the fact that he's not here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| A week from this Thursday, we're going to have our fourth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| and probably final city-county joint work session on the ridgetop slope hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=486)|
| 0:08:15| And so it'll be here in the small assembly room at five o'clock, and the public is welcome to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=495)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| On Wednesday, May the 31st, from 630 to 830,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=505)|
| 0:08:29| I will be hosting the candidates for mayor and city council coming to the third district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=509)|
| 0:08:36| and this will be at Cumberland Estates in the rec center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Again, August 31st, 630 to 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| Most of the candidates for council and mayor have responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| They will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| This will not be a forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| So people who have been over-formed, this is not one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| This is an opportunity for the candidates to speak about two to three minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| and then to be interrogated individually by voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=545)|
| 0:09:07| They meet and greet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I want to mention at a recent lunch that was hosted by Gerdau, formerly Ameristill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=552)|
| 0:09:21| They hosted a neighborhood event there and invited a lot of the community people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| But I found out during the meeting that Gerdau was actually recycling the steel from the Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| So the steel that's being taken out of the old bridge is being taken to Gerdau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| They're refurbishing it, and they're sending it back to Henley Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| So I just like the process about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| They also are recycling waste material as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| And I just wanted to mention that and give a little accolades to Gerdau for being a good neighbor in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| and also giving some people some jobs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| I just wanted to give my colleagues an update on the sign situation out at the Cheryl Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| and just let you know that I've had some very good conversations both with the Aldi Foods folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| and also with the Gordon Food folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| And we're hoping to see what might come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| But they've been most cooperative, and conversations are still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| The other thing I had, and I assume this might be appropriate, is if Debbie, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=625)|
| 0:10:31| or the law department could kind of give us an update on the pension situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| Several people have called me about that, and all I know is what I've read in the newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| There was a hearing this past Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| The Chantry Court Part 2 is on the city's writ of certiorari,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| which is asking the court to review the decision of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| to determine whether the actions they took with regard to their May 2010 decision was illegal in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=653)|
| 0:11:01| And the chancellor heard arguments and said he would be issuing a written opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| But he did not give a time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| I'm waiting on some information from the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| Well, let me just make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| I know that early voting is going to start pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| And I just want to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| Is it September the 7th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| And I don't think we'll have a council meeting before that time, will we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| Well, anyway, let me just encourage everyone to vote, to come out and vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| because it's coming up pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| So I just wanted to make note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 21, Article 2 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| to accurately define the routes of the trolleys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| and properly define the current duties of the Knoxville Transportation Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=724)|
| 0:12:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| I do have some questions in regard to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| The Knoxville Transportation Authority and CAT, are they one in the same entity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| And I guess, Deputy Mayor Martin, this might be for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| I'm going to quickly yield to Cindy to explain to you the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| You almost need a player card to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| And so, Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Good evening, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| The KTA was established by city ordinance to function primarily as an advisory board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| and to also approve routes, establish fares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| and to be the public input conduit that is necessary in order to receive federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| CAT is a logo, and CAT is basically a department of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=779)|
| 0:13:06| So the KTA is created by city ordinance to be an advisory board to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| on matters related to public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| That's been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| So if we approve this tonight, CAT, the operating arm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| will continue to do what CAT has been doing in reporting, asking for money, seeking bids, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| Ms. McGinnis, when was CAT established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| When was that established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| Just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| It's been patrons management, and I want to say mid-'70s, if anybody here has a recollection of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=826)|
| 0:13:56| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| I thought you might know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Thank you anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Most of us weren't born then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Well, we have a motion on the floor, I do believe, and I believe it's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=844)|
| 0:14:11| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| zoning regulations to reflect changes to the Tennessee Technology Corridor Development Authority Enabling Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| 9C is an ordinance to close Mann Street from Sutherland Avenue to Southern Railway right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| subject to conditions and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| University of Tennessee applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Before we vote on that, we have one person signed up to speak on that, David Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| We have two people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Mr. Williams, if you don't mind, we have Ken Stoner first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| If he would come down and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=910)|
| 0:15:20| Ken Stoner, 308 Ginbrook Lane with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| This is the second reading of this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| I think we've provided updates on this, and I think it's a terrific project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| It will beautify that whole Sutherland corridor area that we've been working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| It will be a great benefit for the vendors and the commercial and the eating establishments in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| and also a terrific enhancement for our university students out there as well to have those rec field sports complex put out in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=945)|
| 0:15:54| So I'm just here to, you know, again, thank everybody for their support of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=954)|
| 0:16:00| and I look forward to continuing to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Councilman DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Before you leave, Mr. Stoner, I think the last time you or the other gentleman were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| you told us that you were studying that question of the monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| or some descriptive thing that would recognize the events that happened at Mansory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| Has that progressed any of the work that you were doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| And I think yesterday Vice Chancellor Rogers, I do think, sent an e-mail to everyone on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=985)|
| 0:16:30| and the neighborhood association saying that indicating what the sign was at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| it still has subject to some review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| You were doing some research, I think, the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| The historical society, the archeological historic society is verifying the information and the dates on there and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| And when we did take Councilman Roddy's recommendation at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| and also added the history back to the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| including the Native American use of the property even before we moved into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| Now, Mr. Councilman DellaVolpe, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Mr. David Williams, if you'd come and give us your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1033)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Again, David Williams, 505 Hollywood Drive in the heart of the Pond Gap community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| I guess with Mr. Woodhull not here, we're only going to lose eight to nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| But we knew when we sought to preserve Man Street that we're going to have an almost unwinnable battle going up against Goliath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1050)|
| 0:17:38| But, nonetheless, it's a battle we felt we had to do to preserve our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| And as a wise man once said, in everyone's life there's a time to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| It's when the brave man chooses, the coward steps aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| So we're going to now, with all humility, go on and try to preserve our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| And I would like to acknowledge Tim Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| I did get a correspondence from him about a draft proposal for the plaque,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| and we indeed look forward to working with him on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| And I would suggest that since many of this information is not in a book or printed form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| we need to take advantage of the people in my neighborhood, like my uncle and my parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| that witnessed or took part in these games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| We're fortunate to have maybe a handful of other citizens involved with this that are still with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1100)|
| 0:18:29| As people know, I'm quite passionate about my neighborhood, and I'm trying to fight off some compassion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1109)|
| 0:18:37| But I did want to make a remark about some of the neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| that did not see fit to include us in their meetings when we discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| I think bad manners are prevalent in this day and age, and this type of action is really not called for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| We do forgive these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ commands us to forgive, which we do, but also says go and sin no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1137)|
| 0:19:04| To sort of end that on a little lighter note, I think some of these people are, say, from the north country, Yankees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| and I think we know they're born with two fewer genes than those of us in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1150)|

| 0:19:23| But now I'd like to go and acknowledge some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| John Hunter of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| We're together working on a little project that will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| I'm going to keep that sort of quiet, but I want to thank Mr. King for some wonderful engineers that we've worked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| And I'd also like to thank Jack Sharp and Tim Burchett, who had a lot of zeal for us in trying to preserve our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1177)|
| 0:19:46| And I'd like to thank Mr. Bailey for his offer last time of working with us through the public property naming committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1186)|
| 0:19:55| And I think we can get together on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| and maybe do something really to enhance the history of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| And I'd like to thank Mr. Pavlis for allowing me a chance at rebuttal last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| I'm new at this, and I've had quite an education this summer going for the planning commission and now city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| And I especially want to make this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| Mrs. Roddy, you're a class act, a class act, almost to the tip top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| If you'd voted for us, you'd have been over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| But I want to tell you what she did at the end of the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| I was outside in the lobby waiting on my ride, and she came out to me and asked, David, are you all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1228)|
| 0:20:35| I appreciate that compassion, that sensitivity, because she thought that I was down in the dumps and disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| But, you know, we'll scratch and claw and get up the next day and go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| And I think that was remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| That's a wonderful thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| And that type of act is rare these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| So you deserve a Pond Gap salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Mr. Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| I was going to say before you left the podium that I sense still some hard feelings, but I want to congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| I think your effort has brought to light the points that are worth saving, the recognition of the history that occurred there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1268)|
| 0:21:17| I suppose you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Some local oral history might have information that doesn't get set down in the books, and that's worth exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| But I hope you'll see that as what is really a healthy outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| And that is, aside from the hard feelings, the healthy outcome is that this has gotten focused on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| There will be some recognition of the history in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| and in a way that actually will do a better educational job because people attending that facility will be able to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1299)|
| 0:21:46| and read and learn something about their community that they wouldn't otherwise learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| and they certainly wouldn't learn from just the street signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| So thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| I think it's been moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| I was going to say Mr. Williams has left the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| but I just wanted to, for the most part, echo what my colleague Mr. Della Vopi said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1327)|
| 0:22:13| And I don't think you should look at this as a defeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| You didn't get the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1336)|
| 0:22:17| but I think you've educated a good part of the public about the historical aspects of Man Street and the activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| I know I've learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| So I don't think you should feel that your time has been wasted, and I don't think you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| So I just wanted to say those few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| And I can't dovetail much more off of that, but I've known David for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| and there's nobody in this city that has their heart more right than David does about protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| and advancing the community that he lives in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| And, you know, that certainly doesn't go unnoticed by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| I don't think anybody in the administration or this council appreciates the hard work that you put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| Sometimes it's thankless, and I hope you don't walk away tonight thinking that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| But you have brought light to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| And I'll just say, when I responded, when I got the e-mail yesterday, I just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| please, if possible, let David and his community have a win out of this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| So I think you've done a great job of representing your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| and I think there's going to be some good come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| As long as the Lord gives me strength, I'll be doing my best for the community and the city, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1410)|
| 0:23:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| I think we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1413)|

| 0:26:31| 11-B is a resolution approving the issuance of a certificate of compliance to Palace Package Store, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1591)|

| 0:26:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1603)|
| 0:26:44| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| 11-C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the Neighborhood Housing, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| to provide $210,000 in Home Investment Partnerships Program funds for the acquisition, rehabilitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| and or new construction of seven houses that will be sold to qualified low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Houseman DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| I wonder if I could ask a question to Becky Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| I know we have been communicating about this, but I think it's worth going over just for the benefit of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| Becky, would you tell us a tad about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| I understand that we're talking about HUD money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| and a requirement to deal with CHDOs as to 15 percent of that HUD money to try to get low-income housing developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1644)|
| 0:27:32| that meets, what, heating and energy efficiency standards, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| We receive home funds annually from the federal government, from HUD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| and 15 percent of those funds are required to be set aside for community housing development organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| These are local nonprofits that develop affordable housing for low-income families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| There are four CHDOs in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| Three of them have funds left over from previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| This year, all of our funds that we've set aside are going to neighborhood housing to build seven houses, new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| and we require the Energy Star certification on all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| And can you tell us what happens in the planning if, in fact, the federal budget starts to get narrower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1701)|
| 0:28:29| and some of these funds are lessened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I guess you'll be having 15 percent of a smaller pot if that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| I mean, the funds we received this year were less than the year before, so those funds naturally will go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| But this is out of the pot that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| And finally, I guess, these dollars get invested in building the new house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| They're ultimately sold to a low-income family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| What is it, 80 percent of the medium income or below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| And then the CDHO, CHDO, those alphabet soup letters get me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| but the entity that does the development, NHI in this case, will receive the sales proceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| and they can reinvest them in additional housing projects that meet your criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| And we can also require that they repay those to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| It's in the status of a loan, but you can allow them to plow it back into another similar project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Well, thank you much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| And I'd like to ask you, once those houses are up, do they apply to your office or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| No, they apply through neighborhood housing for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| And neighborhood housing does a real good job of preparing low-income home buyers for purchase of their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| So they have a program where they provide education and training and case management and budgeting help and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1793)|
| 0:30:00| So anybody interested in buying a house that meets the income guidelines should apply through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| 11D is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with CAFRA Engineering Consultants, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| for the South Castle Street sidewalk project for an amount not to exceed $172,674.49,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| which will be funded by the State of Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Yeah, I just have a quick question for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| In this, the total project cost is $500,000, which, if I read this correctly, the design fee is part of that $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1841)|
| 0:30:50| Can you tell me just offhand, kind of a rule of thumb, what are sidewalks costing, a running foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1850)|
| 0:30:56| this one being five feet wide, for instance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| We've experienced a variety of range of costs for sidewalk construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| Depending on the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| In the simplest sense, it could be, you know, maybe $300 to $500 a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1867)|
| 0:31:14| And in this particular situation, there isn't an existing curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| and we anticipate the purchase of some easements for the work and the installation of a storm drainage system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1880)|
| 0:31:28| Normally, something like this, though, that includes or you do have situations where you have curbs and drainage and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| I didn't realize that there are different situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Councilman DellaVolpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| I have been talking with Mr. King and even teasing him somewhat about our road, our sidewalk projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1903)|
| 0:31:51| I think they're wonderful things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| And any place you go in any neighborhood in the city, everyone wants more of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| I'm thrilled that this particular contract award we're looking at is going to go to an African-American firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| I think that's a positive thing and a healthy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| I am concerned, going back to Councilman Grieve's question, we're doing 1,300 feet of a sidewalk at $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1930)|
| 0:32:20| That's a quarter of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| That's a $2 million-a-mile sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| And Mr. King explains that when you deal with TDOT and the Department of Transportation, I guess, that costs go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1944)|
| 0:32:34| Because you see things like historical archaeological surveys and environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| I'm trying to picture the impact from a sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| It kind of eludes me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| But I understand that there's a lot of red tape that you have to go through in order to touch those DOT things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1964)|
| 0:32:51| Do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| My suggestion to you, and apparently it's not going to go anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| but we ought to develop more in-house expertise to do some of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| Surely, to heavens, we can do it cheaper than these costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| They just seem so extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1985)|
| 0:33:07| And I realize you're not going to take my suggestion of getting a few two-by-fours and some saccharine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| and get out there and make you some sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| But go ahead and just tell us a bit about this process, since it is a DOT-funded thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=1994)|
| 0:33:20| Well, what I've tried to explain to Councilman Della Vopi is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| It was very dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| When you use federal money through a variety of programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| this particular one is the CMAQ program, congestion mitigation air quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| that the city of Knoxville is eligible for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| that there's a variety of requirements that we have to go through to utilize that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2018)|
| 0:33:44| And so the design cost includes those things that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| One of them that he's referred to is the environmental document that has to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| Hopefully that will be one of the more simpler ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| but we always have to anticipate that we could be asked to do a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| And as you see in the contract, there are some things that are listed that, as I told the councilman today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2044)|
| 0:34:11| that we may or may not have to do, but we have to have that in the contract in case we need to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| If we don't, then we won't spend that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| In fact, you told me, and that was a very important point, that the line item is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| If we are not required to touch that base, we will not incur those costs as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| That's a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| That's a real plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| This contract is a cost not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| If something comes up unusual, then we would be required to come back to council to exceed that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| I did offer to buy him a level along with the two-by-fours if he was going to build his own sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| The chair will recognize there's a representative here from the company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| and the chair will take this opportunity to recognize the representative who is here with us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| If you'd come down and give us your name and where you're from, a little bit about your company, if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| Chair Brown, Honorable City Council Members, Director King, and other executive staff, my name is Valentino Bates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| I am the president of Koffer Engineering Consultants, 225 Peachtree Street, Suite 1600, Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| We are a 25-year-old firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| We have about 125 individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| We do about $15 million in annual revenues a year in the avenues of civil engineering and environmental engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2131)|
| 0:35:40| Our name, Koffer, is from the Egyptian pharaoh who mandated the building of the Sphinx in Egypt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| His dad was Cheops who built the Great Pyramid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| Koffer did the Sphinx and the second-largest pyramid, and his brother Khufu did the smallest of the three Great Pyramids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| We believe that our engineering will stand that test of antiquity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| so we intend that these sidewalks at 500,000 are going to be in the ground for at least 3,000 or 4,000 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| And with that, I yield the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Well, let me say we're glad that you're doing this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and the city is now trying to increase some business with minority and women-owned firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| We had a workshop some time ago with the Black Business Contractors Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| so we're glad that you'll be able to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| Also, on Castle Street that's in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| and a lot of students from Austin East are walking home from school on that street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| and there is a safety issue there because there's no sidewalks at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| So I think the community is going to be very happy once it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| I'll be happy, and that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| Let me recognize Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Sir, I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to drive up from Atlanta to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| to address this item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| It's certainly a high compliment to this council and to the citizens of this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| that you feel that this contract is that important in your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| and we take that compliment very humbly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| And thank you for taking the time to join us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I wouldn't have missed it for the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Councilman DelaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Yeah, I might just mention I hope you will consider if there's an opportunity that you take on a few local folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2245)|
| 0:37:32| that might do some of the tasks in your assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| I know you've got an engineering team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| I think you said 125 strong, so you're certainly capable of doing it in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| But if there's an opportunity, maybe you can get a Knoxville intern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| or someone to work with you and kind of learn the trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| We will definitely do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| One other thing that I should say, since you mentioned that we are a minority business enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| one of the things that we try to do is give back in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| We have met with Director Evans and have suggested to him that we would try to mentor other minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| and women-owned businesses here in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| so that we teach them the things that we've learned in our 25 years in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| That's a noble thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| We need a motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2307)|
| 0:38:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2308)|
| 0:38:29| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| So ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| We are down now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| We have Robert Edwards, if he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| If you come down and give us your address and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| I live at 1515 Isabella Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| I just want to bring congratulations to you, Mr. Mayor, on your marriage this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2331)|
| 0:38:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| And we've got the perfect place for you for your bachelor party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I brought it up for our KCDC meeting this morning and residents over at Isabella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| about getting security on KCDC property coming in after hours and on weekends to maintain order at the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| to keep the illegal people that do not live there, keep them off the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2360)|
| 0:39:26| and maintain order where everybody will be safe and sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| We had a lady get attacked over a month ago by someone who did not live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| She sustained injuries, but she's okay now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| I just want to bring a proposal to city council about getting security on KCDC property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2380)|
| 0:39:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| That's duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Let's see if we can do something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| If there's no further business to come before the council, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2390)|
| 0:40:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110823?start=2409)|
