| 0:01:20| stand please. Let's bow our heads. Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another beautiful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=80)|
| 0:01:26| day that you have made. We thank you for the privilege and the honor of trying to proceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| with the business of this city. We ask a special blessing upon those who are less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| We ask that you would guide and protect them. These and other blessings we ask in thy son's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| name. Amen. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=104)|
| 0:01:53| Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| for all. I'd like to welcome, of course, all the new members, new faces here. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=119)|
| 0:02:10| sure I'll speak with Council and the rest of the remaining Council members that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=130)|
| 0:02:15| excited and look forward to working with everybody and welcome them. So we're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=135)|
| 0:02:23| out. I will recognize Councilwoman Palmer for the review function of the Beer Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=143)|
| 0:02:30| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Thank you, fellow Council members. Beer Board 101 is just basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| a basic introduction to what the Beer Board does and what the limits are and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| positives are. I've asked people to contribute to this tonight so that we have a little variety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| but also from different functions. Allison will be here from the Law Department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| she's going to talk about the Beer Board ordinance itself and the role of Council when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| we sit with our Beer Board hats on. Wanda Day is going to be from the Revenue Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=179)|
| 0:03:04| and she's going to walk us through an application whether we are going to open a bar or a convenience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| store. Records checks and compliance checks, Sergeant Tracy Hunter is our person from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=190)|
| 0:03:17| the Knoxville Police Department. The task training is something that is required before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| you can get a permit and Karen Pershing from the Metropolitan Drug Commission will talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=203)|
| 0:03:28| to us about that. And Cindy Mitchell, who is a veteran of Beer Board hearings, meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=208)|
| 0:03:35| and all knowing everything, is going to be able to give us a little bit of the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| of the hearing officer and how that role has changed for a variety of reasons over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| time. Vice Mayor Pavlis has been a Beer Board member for ten years, chairman for at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=226)|
| 0:03:53| two and I think more than that, isn't that right? Eight years. So he has some special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=233)|
| 0:03:58| considerations that sometimes come before us that cause us to scratch our heads and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| get real annoyed. So he's going to help us with those. And so if it's all right with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=242)|
| 0:04:08| you, Allison, if you would like to begin with your presentation. And these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| all have a time limit and nobody can talk more than ten minutes because I thought that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| was about how long our attention spans were. I'm Allison Evertine with the City Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| and I promise that I'm going to talk less than ten minutes. I have been with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| for about nine years and ever since I've been here I've worked on the Beer Board cases that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=266)|
| 0:04:30| actually are sent to the revocation hearings. What I've provided to you in my packet, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| it's attached with my card so you have it, is the authority that we have as the Beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| Board of the city. It starts with our city charter and the first page of your packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| is our charter. Section 221 is what gives you the authority to act with regard to beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| What I wanted to discuss with you is the state still regulates alcoholic beverages and at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| the end of your packet is a copy of the statute that gives the city, this is a state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| it gives the city the authority to regulate beer. Remember, though, they do still regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| alcoholic beverages. While our power is rather broad regarding beer, there are still some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| restrictions and that's why we have some guidelines in our code about what we can and cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=310)|
| 0:05:16| So, one other thing that we provided to you is Chapter 4. Charles Swanson couldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| here tonight and he wanted me to apologize for that. He did want me to give, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| the new council members got a new council member binder and they thought it might be a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=326)|
| 0:05:31| idea to give you Chapter 4. You can use this for your beer board. This chapter is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| guides you in your beer board meetings. So the entire code section with regard to beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| is in this three-punch packet. One thing that I was asked to discuss is the administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| versus legislative role that you hold as the beer board. You all are city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| and as a city council member, you have a legislative role. But when you come to beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=354)|
| 0:05:59| board, the hour before city council meeting on Tuesday nights, you've got to take off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=359)|
| 0:06:03| your legislative hat and put on your administrative, ministerial hat. I know we've got several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| lawyers here in the bunch. You all understand that very clearly. We've got several folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| that have been on beer board for several years. So you understand there are going to be times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| where you're going to want to ask, why can't we change this rule? And you're going to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| to ask that at the beer board because that's when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| The important thing to remember is that you have to follow the code during the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| meeting and be an administrative. Check the list almost. Check the box. And Tracy will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=387)|
| 0:06:32| go into a lot about what the list has and entails. But when you actually get to city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| council, if there's something you want to correct and you don't like about our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| that's when you talk about it at city council. So emphasize that. Just remember you've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| two different hats on. Beer board, administrative, very check the box. City council is when you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=406)|
| 0:06:52| acting as a legislator. And I know we've had several questions as we've gone on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| beer board that ultimately got resolved at city council. So that is one thing that Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=417)|
| 0:07:05| Palmer wanted me to discuss. The other thing that I thought I would discuss just briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| Cindy may go into it in more detail. We have a hearing officer system versus the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| hearing the actual revocation suspension cases. What happens in practical terms is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| we will get complaints about a business or we will inspect a business and find violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| At that point, KPD puts together a packet and sends it to the law department. It's our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| role in the law department to review that information and make a determination of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| or not it should go to a revocation suspension hearing. At that point in time, we prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| a noncompliance complaint. We file that with Cindy Mitchell. Cindy Mitchell takes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| as the recorder for the beer board. And she sets up the hearing. She gets the hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| officer. And then we meet. And it's very much like a trial at that point. The hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| is the judge. We have discovery rules just like in a trial. We gather a lot of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| And then we present witnesses if we actually go to a hearing. Most of the time these cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| do settle. We're not in the role of putting people out of business. We want them to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=487)|
| 0:08:12| the rules, however. And if they are repeat offenders, the violations get more severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| Almost always, if they get to a hearing, we're going to have a suspension. We oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| will also have fines. And so that's something that we try to be very consistent about. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| we have one business that has had the same kind of violation as another business, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=507)|
| 0:08:31| we're going to try to be consistent with what our settlement offer is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| So that's, in a nutshell, what my role is in the law department. I think, Tracy, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=515)|
| 0:08:40| want to take over on the next part of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=520)|
| 0:08:45| Okay. Let me start with fingerprints and background check procedure. Once an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| files the application with the business tax office, Wanda faxes us over a copy of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| application. We'll put it in a pending file. That way we know who to be expecting phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| calls for for appointments. They make an appointment with our office. We instruct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| them to bring two forms of ID. We prefer government. It's going to be government issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| photo ID, and then they need a second one, either a Tennessee driver's license, a passport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| or we prefer the second ID to be a Social Security card. Our records counter will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| the background check for us. We take them back in our office, fingerprint them, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| then we review the background check. Part of the packet I gave out to you details this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| process, but also gives you three copies of some of the businesses that have gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| before the Beer Board on November 15th. There are certain violations or convictions, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| should say, that would preclude them from getting a beer permit, which is listed at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| the bottom of the Beer Board check paper. Pursuant to the state law, for the previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| 10 years, if they are convicted of any violation of any ordinance related to the sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| possession, manufacture, or transportation of beer, any state law against the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| possession, sale, manufacture, transportation of an alcoholic beverage or beer, conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| for a violation of any crime involving moral turpitude or any felony, and that's for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| previous 10 years, that they would not be able to be on a beer permit. So we look over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=610)|
| 0:10:16| the background checks. I then make up this report and bring it to the Beer Board, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| this is what we go over. As you can see on that first example, one of the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| had a conviction for days and hours of retail sale, and I put the conviction date. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| first column after the applicant name and title, that column will be if there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=634)|
| 0:10:41| convictions that would preclude them from being on the beer permit. Under other information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| that's just any other background we might have found during the check, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| third column is what they listed on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| The other thing I was going to talk about is our compliance checks. Also part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| packet that I prepared was just a detailed list of how we do our compliance checks. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| specifically follow TCA 3915.413. That's what allows us to do our compliance checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=668)|
| 0:11:17| using underage cadets. That statute actually says it's legal for us to use somebody under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| the age of 21 to send into a business and attempt to purchase alcohol solely for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| purpose of enforcing those laws. And there's a very specific way we have to do that. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| are not allowed to disguise the cadet's appearance. We use underage police cadets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| They're between 18 and 20 years old. They're not allowed to disguise their appearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| and we must take a picture of them before we start the operation and then after to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| that their appearance maintained the same and wasn't changed. They're not allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| make any false statements designed to trick or mislead the person they're buying the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| from. If they're asked any questions regarding the purpose for their purchase or what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=715)|
| 0:12:05| age is, they have to tell the truth on those two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=725)|
| 0:12:14| And if they're asked for identification, they have to show their state-issued government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| ID. They can't use any fake ID. So they use their real driver's license when we go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| and do these checks. And we also take a photocopy of their driver's license and put them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| the file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| After we conduct the stings, within 10 days, whether they sold to the cadet or not, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=751)|
| 0:12:36| required to notify them in writing that we did conduct a check and what the outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=756)|
| 0:12:42| was. And we usually mail those out. If they actually sold to the cadet, we prepare a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| telling them they have 20 business days to submit a remedial plan on how they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| to prevent this from occurring again. And we actually hand deliver those and get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| to sign for it if it's a first offense. If it's a second offense and it's handed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| to the beer board clerk's office and they schedule an administrative hearing and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| they come before the beer board to explain their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| At the back of the packet is a copy of the compliance check we conducted on September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=792)|
| 0:13:17| 16th. And this is what I emailed to everybody on the beer board after we've conducted a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| compliance check. It'll include a list of the businesses and their addresses that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| checked, whether they sold, the time we were there, and whether their ID was checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| It also includes a two-year sale to minor history. For purposes of taking action against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=813)|
| 0:13:40| their beer permit, we only go back two years. So if they've sold three times in six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=820)|
| 0:13:46| it won't matter if it's been more than two years. They won't be going before the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=826)|
| 0:13:53| board or before a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=833)|
| 0:13:57| I also included a couple pictures of one of the cadets that we used to show how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| do the pictures before and after. An underage sale report that is completed by the cadet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| on every sale. And then one of the citations that we issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=847)|
| 0:14:15| Thank you, Sergeant Hunter. Vice Mayor Pavlis, do you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Or do you want to wait until we go through the package with Wanda Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Yeah, that would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| All right. Wanda is the person who can, and her two associates, can answer any question we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=867)|
| 0:14:34| about the beer board. And if you have questions, please don't hesitate to call her, not an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| before the meeting, but when we get the packets on Thursday night and you go through the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| then call and they'll be able to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| And we have, she brought with us tonight the beer board packet, which we will use Tuesday night at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=889)|
| 0:14:56| Normally, this is special delivery on Thursday nights to our houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| But tonight, since we were going to be here, she's doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| And so she's going to walk us through the process of getting a permit and what these applications look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| Microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| Push the red button. Hello? There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| Sorry. In the packet of forms, the heading attached forms, number one is the beer permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| I'd like to reference that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| The application has to be submitted in our office and the fees paid by the first day of the month to appear on that month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| The first legal size sheet is the application checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| We do complete this and give it to the applicant when they apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| It shows them what is still lacking from the application file and the things that they still need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| The beer permit fees are $250 for the application itself, $50 for a one-day special event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| which is generally fundraisers for non-profit organizations, and $25 for each records check needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=965)|
| 0:16:12| And this is what Tracy just alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| Records checks are done on all owners and managers listed on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| And there is a $25 publication fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| We have to put a public notice in the new Sentinel at least ten days prior to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| The fee for our January the 10th public notice was $128.82, which we ended up a little bit on the good side there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=988)|
| 0:16:36| But sometimes when we have businesses who have multiple, multiple owners, the $25 doesn't cover it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=996)|
| 0:16:41| So this just kind of evens out afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1004)|
| 0:16:53| Then we have the current city business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| That's already a no-brainer because you have to have a business license from our office before we can apply the beer permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| They do need to obtain a certificate of zoning from the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| and that is just for your use to show you the zoning of the property and that it is proper for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| And then a copy of their corporate charter, LLC, if applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| The next three are the inspections, building inspection, fire prevention, and the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| We send notice to these offices of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| In fact, we send them a copy of the application for their use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| It is up to the applicant to call them and set up appointments for these inspectors to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| The inspector can come out one time, come out 20 times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| It's just this is part of what they pay their fees for to get this inspection down pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| And then a copy of their Tennessee state sales tax registration and the task certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| And then we do require that the former ownership, if there is one, surrender their beer permit before we can issue the new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1069)|
| 0:17:58| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| And if you'll notice, turn over to the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| That is the actual beer permit application itself that the applicant completes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| It's pretty self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| We get down to number 10, and this is where the measurements come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| So we do the applicant fills these in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| We don't help them at all with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| This is their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| They just have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| They ask us to help quite a bit, but we just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| We won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| But we do put these on a document that is sent to our engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| They actually do measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| It is sent back to us, and you will note it is in your packet tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| And for on-premise consumption, they have to be at least 300 feet away from the facilities listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| Off-premise, it's 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| The next form is the affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| It's pretty self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| It is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| It has to be notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Next is the beer permit owner-manager application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| As I said, each individual listed on the application must fill one of these in, complete it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1147)|
| 0:19:14| and then go to Tracy's office to be fingerprinted through the records check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1154)|
| 0:19:24| And if the application request is approved at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| we do give the applicant the beer permit, the representative that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| If the application is approved subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| meaning that some documents or inspections are missing from the file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| but the board has approved the application pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| the beer permit remains in our file for 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| and the applicant has that much time to obtain the missing items and pick up the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| It means that you all have acted on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| It is up to us, then, to make sure that they do give us the remaining documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1193)|
| 0:19:58| If the applicant can't complete those items and obtain the permit within those 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| we do send a certified notice, which is number four in the forms that I've included tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| informing them that they must appear at the next meeting to address the board and request an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| And I thought most of the forms that I put in there are kind of self-explanatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| but I'll be glad to answer any questions or go over them if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| But I think they're pretty cut and dried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| One thing that I will point out, as council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| you may receive complaints from business owners if they've got a violation and KPD has cited them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| On this affidavit that they fill out and sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| it tells them that they have to comply with the rules in Chapter 4 of the Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| It also tells them if they relocate or if they change ownership, you have to get a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| So a lot of information is in this affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| We get complaints in our office often about how they didn't know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and we quickly pull that document and say, do you remember signing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| So just be aware if you get calls from your constituents and they say KPD has cited us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| and we didn't know that was a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| a lot of the rules that they have to follow are right here in this affidavit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1263)|
| 0:21:12| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| I think that's ñ she's pretty well covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Councilman Grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Just for clarification, I know this has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| As far as the distance requirement, if they have a license from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| then our requirement doesn't exist, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| Yes, sir, a state ABC liquor license, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| But if you have an ABC liquor license, though, you still have to come to us for a beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I just want to make sure to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| Councilman, Vice Mayor Pavlis, do you want to take an opportunity before we move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| to talk about some special zoning districts, or do you want to wait and do that at the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| I'll just wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| I've got a list of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1313)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Next on our list, I believe, is Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| and they have quite a few things for us, quite a nice package of handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| And Karen Pershing is the executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| And while she's coming up to talk with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| there is a task force with the Metropolitan Drug Commission that is looking at underage drinking violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1332)|
| 0:22:18| And the City of Farragut, the City of Knoxville, and Knox County are all working together on that particular thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Thank you, Brenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I was going to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| And Brenda has been great to serve on that task force, this underage drinking policy panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| For those of you who aren't familiar with the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| we are a nonprofit that was actually chartered 25 years ago by city and county government officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| So your predecessors actually brought us into being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| and both city council and county commission have a seat on our board as well as the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| So we're looking forward to continuing to work with city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| on reducing access to youth in particular of alcohol and other substances in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| I wanted to also brought our staff with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| A lot of times people think the Metropolitan Drug Commission is this huge organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| and they're usually surprised to hear that there are only three of us on staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| But we work a lot with community volunteers and other professionals in the community to actually do our work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1402)|
| 0:23:30| But I wanted to introduce you to Heather Sutton, who's our media relations and project director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| She is the face that you will see most often at your beer board meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| but any of the three of us could be here at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| so we thought it was important for you to put faces and names together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| And then Sarah Harder is also primarily our youth project director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| She works with our youth programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| But I wanted to walk you through the folder that you just received to let you know what all is in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| that will hopefully help you as some of you begin your new duties and others of you just continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1444)|
| 0:24:14| On the right-hand side, the first rather big document is actually a side-by-side comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1454)|
| 0:24:25| of the City of Knoxville, Knox County Commission, and the Town of Farragut's beer board ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| kind of looking at each group's differences and similarities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| The very next thing that you will see is a little sheet behind that called the Tennessee Responsible Vendor Act of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1479)|
| 0:24:50| As you start reviewing your rules and regulations, you will notice references to the Responsible Vendor Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| So I think it's important that you understand how that program works as you all are making your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| And then back behind that is the task force outline, which the task force is what's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| the training that's required for anyone applying for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| And you will see the outline in that packet that basically goes over the content of those courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1518)|
| 0:25:26| Now, if you're an on-premise and you're going to be serving, your class is a little more involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1526)|
| 0:25:37| because there's greater liability if you are serving alcohol than if you're just selling alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| So we call that on- and off-premise, just so you get familiar with the terminology that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| So on-premise is people come in, you serve them while they are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Off-premise, they're coming, purchasing, and leaving, such as a liquor store and convenience store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| So there are some differences in the information that's covered in the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| And we're trying in our task force to try to come to some understanding of what that training should encompass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| TABC, the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission, requires five hours of training for on-premise service for liquor permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1577)|
| 0:26:29| Right now, our training for off-premise is a three-hour requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1589)|
| 0:26:35| And once they complete that, of course, then they're eligible to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| If they go from restaurant to restaurant, that permit is good for a period of five years for on-premise service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| So it gets a little confusing depending on whether you're talking about a business that's actually serving on-site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| and one that is just selling a product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| So I think that information will help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| And I only have ten minutes, so I can't go over all of it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1621)|
| 0:27:05| But we're there as a resource also to help you at any time that anything comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| In fact, we fly emails around quite frequently over certain issues at times that arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1632)|
| 0:27:20| On your left-hand side, I just wanted to draw your attention to the reason why the Metropolitan Drug Commission wants to work with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1640)|
| 0:27:30| One of our goals, of course, is to reduce the use of alcohol among people under the age of 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| And as you can see in the data on the right-hand side, alcohol is the drug of choice amongst our high school students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1658)|
| 0:27:47| And so anything we can do to change the environment to where access is more difficult is what we try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1667)|
| 0:27:55| And working with you all and working with business owners is an important step in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1675)|
| 0:28:03| So you will see the lifetime adolescent drug use, which is if they've ever used at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| Right behind that is current adolescent drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| What we do is ask them, have you used in the last 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| So that's the difference in those two questions and those two data points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| And then another problem that we see with young people is binge drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| So I wanted to draw your attention to the binge drinking rates, which we are seeing a decline in, which is fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1705)|
| 0:28:33| And then there's just some information behind that about our organization and the trainings and reference materials that we have available in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1713)|
| 0:28:50| Is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Yeah, I wonder if there's a slow time when you're giving one of your classes, if you could invite us to come and sit in on a task training session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1733)|
| 0:29:01| That would be a healthy thing for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Yeah, as a matter of fact, Knoxville Police Department actually conducts those classes, and they are held on Thursdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| And they definitely would strongly encourage city council members to sit through those classes if you have an opportunity to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1751)|
| 0:29:20| so that you'll see what information is actually being provided and also give input to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| There may be parts of those training programs that need to be strengthened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| So I think the more people that sit in and the input that they get from you all would be greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| Officer Hunter can take us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| It's every Thursday from 10 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| Are you relinquished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| Sorry, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| I don't know, Karen, if you're the right person to ask this question of, but I'm going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| There's been some talk about owners, operators getting trained and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| What about the clerks who actually sell the product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Either you've talked a bit about servers, but people at the convenience store, do they have some training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| Do they have to get training prior to their ability to sell at a convenience store or serve in a restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1814)|
| 0:30:21| The permit holder, depending on which governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| the only one that's required to take the training is the person asking for the permit as far as off-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1826)|
| 0:30:35| So a clerk is not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| The business owner, whoever's name is on that permit, is required to make sure their employees are trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1837)|
| 0:30:45| We provide information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| We actually give that to Wanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| And as soon as they get approved, she gives them materials to use for training purposes that we provide to the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1849)|
| 0:30:58| We also now have DVD toolkits, training toolkits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| And in these toolkits, they can use those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| There's a pre- and a post-test as well to make sure that they do understand their responsibility before they start serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1866)|
| 0:31:15| But basically, your permit holder is responsible for ensuring that their employees are fully informed and trained prior to selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| You might also mention this little card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| You'll see that slid in there in your folder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| That is a little ID checker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| These are also provided in the kits by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1894)|
| 0:31:38| You can actually put these over a Tennessee driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| And you'll notice this says 2011 on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| We get a new one every year, and we don't have our 2012 new ID checkers yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| So this is 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| So the dates that are on there, you'll see the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| You must be born before this date in order for you to be over age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| So it draws attention to the birth date so that they can focus in on that and see it rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| Also, on underage people who are under 21, there's also a red line on the side of the driver's license that really draws it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1929)|
| 0:32:19| There's really no excuse if you check an ID for selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| Once you have these little tools, plus the state has made it very easy with the larger birth date that's in red now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1944)|
| 0:32:33| and also the red line along the side of the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| And I apologize because I don't have an under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| I wish I did, but to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| You know, it's really hard to call you councilman, but I guess I'm going to call you Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| I asked one question about the adolescent drug use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| Is this done, the survey, only in high school, or does it include middle school as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| We do have a middle school survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| It's actually done on even years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| The middle school survey is conducted, and then on the odd years, the high school survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| And it's done randomly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| The Knox County Health Department, along in conjunction with Knox County Schools, actually conducts the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| And they are chosen randomly, the students are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| And it is a representative sample of all the schools, but we cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| The survey numbers are not high enough to where we can look at it by school, but we can report it by county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2011)|
| 0:33:41| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| Any other questions for the Metropolitan Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| Not quite the same drug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Thank you, Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2038)|
| 0:34:12| Council, thank you, Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| I've just handed out a folder that just has two or three things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| and probably some may overlap with what Allison has already handed out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| Included in it is a brief Beer Board 101 as far as citations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| what happens when an establishment gets a citation, the first citation, the second citation, and then a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2070)|
| 0:34:39| So you can read over that, and if you have any questions, it's just a brief Cliff Notes version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| So let me know if you have any questions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| I also have included the two beer ordinances that I send out in the packets when we are scheduling administrative hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2087)|
| 0:34:56| And as you will notice, after two citations within a two-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| the establishment comes before the full beer board for an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2101)|
| 0:35:07| They also have to turn in a remedial plan and pay a $500 fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| And then if they receive three citations within two years, it automatically goes to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| And that we typically, or historically, I will say, we used to hear a lot of those cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| and Allison can tell you that they used to go to full hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| We had hearing officers and court reporters and witnesses, and it's rare that that happens now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| because most of the cases are settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| They try, as Allison said, to not put anybody out of business, but yet hold them accountable for the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| And cases are typically settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| It seems to be much more efficient and hopefully less expensive as far as the hearing officers are concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| or at cost as far as hearing officers have gone down tremendously since that has been happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| So anything else you'd like for me to cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| And I think you have included a list of the people who are currently hearing officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| And also a checklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| I just put that checklist in there for you to see that when an establishment is sent to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| that is the checklist I use to make sure I've covered all the bases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| and the notification goes out correctly and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| So that's just basically for you to see all the different things that we go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2195)|
| 0:36:41| when we do have a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| It is not considered to be a light thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| We consider it to be serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Cindy, how are hearing officers selected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| The ordinance says basically that the city attorney would choose those hearing officers, and that's been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| We have had very little turnover, really, over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| We've had a couple of them that we had to begin with that one's a judge now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| and just different reasons that they had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2234)|
| 0:37:21| No, Charles Swanson was the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| It's the city council attorney who would choose those, whomever that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| Thank you, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| One thing that we just passed out, I noticed a stack over here, and I didn't copy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| I think Cindy may have for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| It's an example of what the notice and order and the noncompliance complaint are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| that are sent to the beer permit holder if we actually are going to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| So you can see an example of what's sent to them, some of the evidence that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| and basically what some of the allegations might be if we're having a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| Vice Mayor Pavlis, special considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Yeah, just a couple of things stand out that, you know, through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| and Councilman Grieve kind of hit on it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2288)|
| 0:38:13| The ABC, if they get that license or if they're through the process and they have a site problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2293)|
| 0:38:20| then if they get the ABC license, the site requirements go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| They don't have to get the qualifications met for the beer permit application itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| But that, at times, has been a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| So that's one thing of note to kind of highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| You know, one of the things that has stood out through the years as well is when you get the background checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2318)|
| 0:38:45| that you would assume that a DUI would preclude someone from getting a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| but it's just not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| And that and fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| If they have a city fine, it's like, wait a minute, we're going to give this person the ability to do business in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| and they still owe us money, but, you know, that's not one of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| or one of the things that would preclude them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| One of the things on the hearings that they go through, you know, that is a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| Well, I mean, it's part of the code, but at any time during that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| we can call an either administrative hearing or a full-blown hearing as described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2367)|
| 0:39:37| And there's a special consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I think I was involved one time in a very egregious situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| to where the beer board chair, the city police department, and the law department all have to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| that you can do a temporary permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| It's an emergency suspension of the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| and it's suspended until the next beer board meeting is called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| And we've had that happen since I've been here, but it's very rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Yeah, it happened one time under my watch the first time years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| Oh, and then the site requirement in the Central Business Improvement District for churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| and what have you goes away within those boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| So that's a special consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| Wanda, you're looking at me like I'm saying something wrong perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Okay, I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| But that's been, you know, that's something a little bit different from the ordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| Those are the only things to me that really stand out that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| A footnote to what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| That's because we have these storefront churches all around Market Square and the town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| so it's hard to get 300 feet away from anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| And if it does help you all to look at the code section that they're referring to, it's 4-66.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| I think it's Delta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Sometimes it helps me to actually look at the words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| So if you need to look at that, that's where that's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| I have a question of Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| This beer board record checks November 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2463)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| The one on there that has a DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| Was that denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Did you all vote against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| Which business are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| Yeah, one on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| And it said Sean Fleming, owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| And it said DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| Oh, that's what he had put on his application that he had a previous DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| But DUI is not one of the convictions that we can use to preclude them from being on the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| But when I did the background check locally, he didn't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| He didn't have any convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| Well, what about Brian Howington then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| On that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| They own conviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| That would keep them from getting the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| But that ended up, he got that expunged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| So that was no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| It was expunged from his record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| So that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| We call that a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| And that was post, if I remember correctly, that case was postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| until he could either address it by taking care of it, removing himself or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2525)|
| 0:42:12| And that we do have postponements from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| So you're saying, back to Allison then, so you're saying that it comes before the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| and you have the right to write it up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| Then it goes back, and when it's city council, then you have the right to discuss whether you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| you should be allowed to have a beer permit with their current DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Under the current state of the code, you can't limit them from having a beer permit for having a DUI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| That's not one of the convictions on that checklist administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| If you don't like that and you want to change that, then we need to research, if you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| and you bring it up at city council that you want to change Chapter 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2574)|
| 0:42:55| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| I'd like to thank everyone who participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| I hope this has answered some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| I remember my first beer board meeting in say a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| I just watched, hoping that I didn't say the wrong thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| So I was thinking back to those days that I would have liked to have had a little bit of a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| I just want to say, Brenda, thank you for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| I felt the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| I mean, here we've been on the beer board for two years, and this has really been helpful to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| I hope it's really helpful to the new folks on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| So thanks for putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Vice Mayor, it's all yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| No other questions on beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| We'll move on with the agenda this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| And after 28 years, we've got a task before us of hiring an attorney for our body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2616)|
| 0:43:45| Obviously, that's a very serious consideration that we have to undertake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| And so we need to start that this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| We're starting into the new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| It's something that obviously is very important, but it's not something that I feel like that we need to rush either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| I mean, obviously, we want to get the right person, but we don't want to just get any person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| So with that opening statement, Councilman Grieve, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| A couple of things that I've been thinking about in looking into this, and I spent some time talking with Susan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| and it might be good if we heard from both Susan and Cindy in terms of kind of the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| It's my understanding that Council has not always had legal counsel, and that a discussion that I had with Susan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| and, Susan, I'm kind of putting you on the spot, that brought up to me, anyway, a question about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2676)|
| 0:44:44| not necessarily do we not select one, but how much of a legal counsel in today's terms do we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2684)|
| 0:44:50| and do we need a legal counsel as opposed to what happened in the years past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| And so I just thought it might be good to kind of just briefly talk about the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| and where we are in terms of having one on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| So if we can, Susan, we had this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| We did have that conversation, and I mentioned to Councilman Grieve that I happened to have worked for the very first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| and I think that's the very first one, and that was Harold Mills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| And I went to work for Harold in his law firm in, I think, probably 77.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| And at the time, he was Council's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| He was already Council's attorney, so exactly how that came to be, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| But I do know that prior to him being in the law firm, he was in the law department under the Testament administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2736)|
| 0:45:49| So sometime after the Testament administration and in 77, that's when he was chosen to be the Council attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2749)|
| 0:45:57| So that is, I think, the very first one that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| He was kind of part-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| I think at the time, the city recorder's office did most of the work associated with his job with Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2766)|
| 0:46:16| I did very little of it in the law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| I think probably Cindy and Teresa or whoever was in the recorder's office was doing most of it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| And at some point, I guess in 82, he became a full-time or part-time employee of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2785)|
| 0:46:32| I can't remember exactly which, but he was an employee of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| And then Council recorder's office did all of the work then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| And then it was when Charles came on that it became a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| So Cindy might know a little bit about all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Yeah, well, thank you for the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| I know it's taxing to go back that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I think as far as the who, what, when, where, and why do we need one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| probably that's what we're here to deliberate on this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| I certainly wouldn't want to put that burden on the shoulders of the staff in the recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| But, you know, the first thing, well, any other opening statements that anybody might want to make on this subject?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2826)|
| 0:47:14| If not, yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| I was just going to say that I can't remember in the last two years a meeting we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| where we didn't turn to Charles and ask, what's the procedure on this, or what's the steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| or how many votes, or what takes precedence, or how do I frame that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| So we have used, whether we need it or not is a nice question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2852)|
| 0:47:35| but we have certainly used the service to help us make decisions on the fly as we proceeded along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2855)|
| 0:47:44| Well, we've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| So, you know, we'll start as per the agenda here with the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| just open it up for what we feel like the qualifications, what we're looking for in this person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2871)|
| 0:48:01| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| Well, I know just with what Nick was talking about also that I know that Charles has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| and I guess we'll refer to the law director as Charles, if that's okay, in terms of who I've been working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2888)|
| 0:48:15| I know that he's been very good for me from the standpoint of not only Robert's Rules of Order, but process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| and then also on the number of resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| I don't know, Cindy, has the law or has legal counsel always done resolutions, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2905)|
| 0:48:30| or is that someone else, or how's that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| The way the ordinances and resolutions are prepared now, part of them comes from the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| Those that come from MPC and anything the administration wants to enter or present to you, as well as contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2918)|
| 0:48:49| they all come from the city law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| Charles basically prepared anything that city council asked him to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| Melissa does the 202 ordinances, but Charles would prepare any ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| or resolution that city council requested him to prepare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| So that's vital. That's important to us also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| I also think, Vice Mayor, that it's important that we find someone that I guess you might say is apolitical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2951)|
| 0:49:18| and I think Charles was very good at that in terms of really guiding us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| So to me, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| I do know that in looking over some of the resumes that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| I feel kind of strongly that the person ought to be from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| Knox County or the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| I guess both, you know. Probably my preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| Yeah, both would be something that I would think about on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| I also think that we could look at the, in terms of if we really go hire someone really on a retainer basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=2991)|
| 0:50:01| or really on an hourly basis the way that I think maybe Charles started out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| I know he spent a lot more time than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| But I guess the other question I have is, and again, Cindy, this would be to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3008)|
| 0:50:14| have you seen a lessening of work required or more so in terms of a legal counsel to counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3014)|
| 0:50:24| How have you seen that over the last few years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| That's kind of hard for me to answer in that because he was not in our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| a lot of times I didn't know, you know, when he was meeting with city council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| or the work that he was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| I do know that just according to him, as far as what Charles would tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| he most always went over his 40 hours a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| But as far as me knowing personally exactly what his workload was every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| I was not aware of that just because he was not in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| I think it was pretty close to 60 hours a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Yeah, that's what he had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Well, I also think the other thing, and I'll let someone else talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| is that the one thing that I really did appreciate about Charles was that he always seemed to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| And phone calls were returned, you know, pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| And I think that's important, that whoever is in this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| that their accessibility is right there when we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| And I know Charles did a lot of things at the last minute for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| And, you know, maybe we need to be better at that, but he was good at answering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3092)|
| 0:51:38| So I think accessibility is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| I think someone that lives in Knoxville or Knox County is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| Those things I'd be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Councilman Delmo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Yeah, I would just add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3109)|
| 0:51:50| I certainly think we ought to have someone with some seasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| Some what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Seasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| You know, part of the practice of law is not just looking up the law and looking up the cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| but understanding how the process works, how the courts work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| and to provide some judgment when they're giving you counsel, not just here's the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| but here's how we can get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Sort of working us through the problems, giving us solution paths rather than dissertations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| We don't really need dissertations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| And so we need someone who's comfortable advising us sort of on the fly, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| that they can sit back, hear the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| and just give us some simple directions that even we can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3153)|
| 0:52:41| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| I was sitting here wondering if I was seasoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| I thought about the qualifications, and, you know, I think it sort of comes down to four things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| I think, one, with any hire, you want someone that's intelligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| is going to give good legal advice, and is hardworking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| I think everybody can agree on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| I think some of the unique things we're looking for is someone that can work with all nine of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| And I think that is going to be a tremendous challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| especially since I assume this is going to come down to voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| You know, I think we should all try to keep in mind, no matter who we end up deciding to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3199)|
| 0:53:25| keep that in mind that that person, even whether you voted with them or against them or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3205)|
| 0:53:31| would be able to work with everybody on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| And then, of course, the members of this body change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| So I think that's an important factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| Third, I think I would like to have someone that's doing it in the spirit of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3220)|
| 0:53:46| I think most of us here have a little bit of, hopefully, a lot of that in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| And I think that city council shouldn't just be another client to this attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| I mean, it should be part of that person doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| I think Charles had, certainly, that was a strong quality of his that, you know, he enjoyed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| and he enjoyed the public process and being part of it and serving the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3247)|
| 0:54:12| And then last, I don't know if it's prerequisite, but I think, of course, experience is helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3252)|
| 0:54:21| Dealing with government law, zoning law, it's not something that comes easy to every lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3261)|
| 0:54:27| It's not something that's covered in most law classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| So I think having experience with government and zoning would be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| In terms of the compensation, I think that could be a separate section of the agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| But I called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| I thought Mr. Swanson was going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3283)|
| 0:54:46| He wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| I found out he wasn't this afternoon, so I called him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| He said over the last ten years he's spent roughly 66.6 hours per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| You were taking ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| He said roughly 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| I mean, this was just very rough, rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| Just on a cell phone, what's a breakdown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| He said 15 to 20 percent on meetings, 10 to 15 percent on calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3309)|
| 0:55:15| Defending litigation, there's just a huge swing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| And then drafting legislation, 15 to 20 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| And it doesn't add up to 100, but, I mean, that sort of gives you a breakdown of where he spent his time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| He said he thought it would be important to know that he took calls, you know, from us and from constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| and from the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Oftentimes those calls were outside business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| So I think we'd want someone that's willing to take calls on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| And those were some of the things we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| And I just thought it would be, you know, a basis to start from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| That's very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Well, I'll just piggyback on, I guess that's what we're here to do, just throw out ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3359)|
| 0:56:03| You know, define experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| So, you know, I would throw out that it had to have at least a minimum of seven years experience practicing law with an emphasis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3365)|
| 0:56:13| Like you're saying, councilman stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| I mean, in practicing governmental law, define that, define seasoning, as Nick said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| So I think they can, I don't really have a problem with them living anywhere, as long as they practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| And I think that's what made Charles Swanson accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| He was downtown office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| I've already called him several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I'm a little bit concerned about the liability of this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| And so I value greatly law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3404)|
| 0:56:47| And I would quiver to think that we wouldn't have somebody readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| So I've already asked him several things about liability and exposure for myself personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| So maybe too late to ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| But I mean, I think it's about practice, where they practice in the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| And I don't necessarily think they have to live in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| but I think they definitely need to be of a good outstanding community citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I don't know how you find that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| I pretty much agree with about everything I've heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| Councilman Grieve commented that someone who is apolitical and not bringing an agenda can be really valuable to all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| because as hard as it is to believe, we won't all nine agree on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| And so this will be a real positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3459)|
| 0:57:42| And the ability to work with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| And once we go through the process and identify the person, that's the person we're all going to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3464)|
| 0:57:51| And so we need to be real comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| I've had several constituents talk to me about this process and what are we going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| and how are we going to do and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| And an overriding concern about this and other issues is where does the person live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| You know, you're working for the city of Knoxville, and this is Knoxville taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| And so I would go along with those who think that living in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| at the very least in Knox County, is a really key consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| And, Councilman Wallace, I like your idea that the person is downtown or, you know, in close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| so that we don't have to traipse all over to find a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| Availability is really key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| Charles has always been wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| And if he couldn't talk, at least let me know that he couldn't talk right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| I probably have called him less than any other council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| But when I called, I did need to talk then or very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| So that's a really important component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| And as far as the seasoning issue, I understand Councilman Della Vopi's reference to seasoning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3529)|
| 0:58:57| Having that governmental work experience, I think, is a really key piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3537)|
| 0:59:07| I don't know about seven years, eight years, ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| Certainly somebody who's fresh out of law school or been in practice for a year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| probably needs a little bit more seasoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Of course, that person would get that with this group, so that's a thought too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| But, anyway, I think that we all have some common ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| I just want to point out one thing while we're in this, I guess, transitional period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| I think Charles has sort of made himself available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| Councilman Starr, you talked to him today, and I did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3580)|
| 0:59:44| So he's been very kind to make himself available right now since we don't technically have anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| And he's agreed to, you know, within reason help us as long as we're moving along the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| And I feel like it's, you know, we're obviously going to do the diligence on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| and get this, you know, done as quick as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| Councilman Delmo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| Yeah, thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| I was just going to say someone was talking about accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| And if you haven't been on council, you've got to realize how things come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3613)|
| 1:00:19| And that is you don't get the packet until, you know, Thursday evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and you might not have the firepower to look at it just then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| So by the time you look at it, you're in Friday or the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| and that means the meeting's coming up on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| That means you're going to have issues come up as you go through that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| as you get calls for your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| And someone needs to be available by e-mail or by phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Most lawyers will do that, but I think that's an important criteria to be looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| because if they aren't available until 9 to 5 on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| you're probably not going to get that same kind of question-answer response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| And the other thing, and it goes back to this seasoning concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| and that is the advice we get tends to be on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| I mean, most lawyers are trained from law school to know how to research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| and resolve a problem, but without experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| you're not going to have a well to draw from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| And that's what I was suggesting, that you've got to be able to reach back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| and sort of give an off-the-cuff opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I mean, you can't be 100% certain, but you've got to have some sense of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| I know where the safe ground is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| So that's important in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| I'm sure that any lawyer that you talk to could solve the problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| given enough time and access to the books or computers or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| But we're looking for someone who's either got a facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| because they have that type of practice themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| or they have enough general experience that they can fill in the gaps pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| I assume we're going to be looking down that end of the table occasionally in the first month or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| when we get a lawyer to bail us out, but he'll be here, so that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| Counselor McGrave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| I was going to say also, in terms of the seasoning part, that I understand what Nick is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| but I'd hate to see us put a time limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| In other words, you know, there probably are some very outstanding young lawyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3732)|
| 1:02:18| who have had the kind of work that maybe they've been doing this for two or three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3738)|
| 1:02:23| depending on what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| So I'd hate to see us put any kind of a set time limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| I do think, though, that it's important from the standpoint of what Councilman Steyer said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3747)|
| 1:02:33| in terms of this public service idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| I think that, as he said, we're all here partly because of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| And I think that the person that's joining our team, sort of getting on board with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| ought to have that same kind of philosophy and realize that, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| they are being paid for a certain amount of work, but that there ought to be the public service added to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3771)|
| 1:02:58| And along those same lines, I think that also the idea that they do live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| I mean, if I was living in Maryville, I wouldn't be on this Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| And I think that being a part of the city and understanding what goes on in the city is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3787)|
| 1:03:14| And I do like the idea that their offices would be downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| I mean, I don't think I'd necessarily rule someone out as long as they were accessible and that I could get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| But I really do believe this business about being a part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| And, Ms. Palmer, just like you, several people have asked, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| if we're going to be spending this money, are we paying someone locally or away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3812)|
| 1:03:37| So those two or three items, I think, are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| But accessibility, I think, is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| And then this public service idea, I think, is something that we ought to look into also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| And, you know, if I might, I'd like to have clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| When you say public service, now, what came to my mind was that the person had been involved in the community throughout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3831)|
| 1:03:59| you know, for the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3839)|
| 1:04:01| Is that what you're talking about or just bringing a sense of public service to that job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Well, I think that's one way you show it is looking at what they've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| I was just saying that they have applied for it in the spirit of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| That this wasn't, you know, like lawyers or like anybody, business is business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3856)|
| 1:04:23| So I didn't want someone that has applied for this position that would see us just as another client, just as another fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3863)|
| 1:04:34| And so that's why I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| I think it's also important to remember and to keep in mind of why we have our own attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| And it's my understanding is that it's because we're a separate branch from the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| And because the law department answers to the mayor, if they were giving us advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| then there would be some separation of powers issues because then we would essentially be getting the advice of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| and then we're not an independent body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| So I think all of us need to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| I know we all, especially the members that have been on council, all have a very close relationship with Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| But he's now with the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| He's now with the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3920)|
| 1:05:21| So if we, you know, if council disagrees, you know, that's why we have our own council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| So I think we need to keep that in mind and, you know, that issue out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3925)|
| 1:05:32| Go ahead, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| That's a really good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| The separation of powers is something that has, I think, sometimes become muddied over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| And we do have very different functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| And I love Charles, and I think he's gone to the wrong side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| The dark side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| I didn't want to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| But Mayor O'Hara obviously thinks that this is a good choice, and I can't disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3954)|
| 1:05:58| But we do need to be very aware that this person is representing the legislative function of the city as opposed to the executive function of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3958)|
| 1:06:09| And most of the time we're in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| And I probably figure that over the next two years that there may be a time or two that we don't sing kumbaya.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3971)|
| 1:06:19| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| You know, Marshall, just to dovetail off your statement, I mean, I think we're all on the same page when I hear a lot of the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3981)|
| 1:06:29| and what have you, but the public service part of it really is intriguing to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| And to take it a step further, it's important to me that they have been involved in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| that they have, you know, coached a little league or soccer or been a member of whatever boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=3998)|
| 1:06:45| because that does show that public spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| So, you know, I think it's a great point that you bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4008)|
| 1:06:53| Now, I don't see any other lights as far as the quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4013)|
| 1:06:57| I'm sorry, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| I was just going to footnote what you two guys were saying, and that was that I remember Charles reminding us that even though he had a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4019)|
| 1:07:05| that allowed him to bill hourly over a certain number of hours per month, that he didn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| He kept track of his hours because that's what you do as a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| You write them down on a sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| But he wasn't just billing us even if he spent more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| If he spent more time, he spent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| That was his attitude, and I think that shows that kind of team spirit thing that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4042)|
| 1:07:28| You know, Nick, also I think the other thing that Charles did is that he had a backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| And I think that's something that we probably need to think about or ask whoever is considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4054)|
| 1:07:40| As opposed to a solo or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| If he wasn't here, he had a lawyer from his office who came and participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| And that's really important, because I remember last year there was a situation where we really needed Charles or his backup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4068)|
| 1:07:57| and there was not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| And it was a very uncomfortable set of circumstances for counsel to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| And I did neglect to mention that, but that's one of my priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| that this person does have someone who can backup, because they may want to take a vacation or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4088)|
| 1:08:14| I can't imagine, but in any case, that's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| We do need to know that they will have a backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4097)|
| 1:08:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| I don't see any other lines, so we'll move on to the selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to throw out a scenario here as a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| And you all may say, this guy's nuts, and sorry we elected him vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| But I'm going to do it just for discussion purposes, and then we'll take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| But my initial thought on this was to be happy to chair the committee, I don't want to call it a search committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4121)|
| 1:08:51| but the committee along with two other members, and dwindle the list based on these qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4131)|
| 1:08:58| and then bring those chosen candidates back before this board, before us, to start the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4138)|
| 1:09:10| whether it be, you know, just have them come and we do an interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4150)|
| 1:09:17| But that to me, I mean, we've got to figure out some place to start, or we can keep having workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| But anyway, that's kind of what I'm throwing out, and I see a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| So, Councilman Grieve, you've got an opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| Sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| With all due respect to the mayor, I think the fact that there's only nine of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4171)|
| 1:09:38| and I think that right now we have, I think, 17 applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4178)|
| 1:09:43| Not to say that we can't extend that, but with 17 applications, I don't see any reason to have three of us look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4183)|
| 1:09:52| What I would much rather do is have all nine of us take a look at what we have, and we can rank them accordingly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| and, you know, have a process where we go by the numbers, for instance, so that we all participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| Instead of putting the burden on you and two other council members, I'd rather see all of us involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4205)|
| 1:10:11| And if, in fact, have we actually cut off the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4211)|
| 1:10:18| That was definite, right, unless we want to reopen it, but it's been cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| So I think with only, I mean, if we had 75, 25, or some, you know, some huge number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| but I know I would imagine that some of us have already started looking at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4228)|
| 1:10:32| and probably ranking in our own minds what we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| And so I would prefer, as I say, with all due respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| Oh, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Like I say, I'm just throwing it out there as a starting point and then just, you know, listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| Well, I'd like to see us all be involved, that possibly what we do is we look at the resumes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| we rank them according to what we think, and then we get back and we say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| George Wallace has five nines and two threes and whatever, you know, type of thing, that we could rank them that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4254)|
| 1:11:01| I'm using you as the lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Ah, yeah, that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| I agree with Councilman Grieve, and we actually have a kind of list that is people were speaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| the things that they thought were important, and we could use that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| and then assign some point values to if we think that getting along with all of us is the highest, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| you need to have five points in that category or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| we could come up with kind of a ranking system like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| But I agree with Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| If we had 25 or 30 or 40 applications, then I would be happy for somebody to whittle them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| But we only have 17, and I did look at them as they were coming in, and looking at this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4298)|
| 1:11:46| it's clear that there would, whether there were point values or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| some people would not be meeting some of these criteria right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| So I would be real comfortable if we continued as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| I guess, has there been, has it been advertised enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| Has it been, do you feel like 17 is enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Do you feel like there's been enough people have applied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| I mean, you're saying don't rush, but, I mean, do you think it's well known that this position is available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| I would refer to the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| One of the things that we asked be done, that it not just be put on the city's website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| but it went to the Knoxville Bar Association, and they e-mail blasted their membership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| which is most of the lawyers that practice in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| And so we're talking about getting out to, you know, 1,500 people plus kind of thing, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4358)|
| 1:12:45| And that would be passed around law firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| So if they didn't look, it's not because they weren't given a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| Now, you know how things go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| People wake up at the last minute anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| But if they weren't interested enough to find out by then, then they probably aren't coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4377)|
| 1:13:03| And that doesn't mean to say that if we pick five hot candidates and then we interview them all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| and don't like any of them, I suppose we can go out and get them and chase them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| because the job is to get an attorney that's going to represent us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| But I think it was fairly well spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| In addition to the ABA or the Bar Association blast and the website, this has been in the paper several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4401)|
| 1:13:29| It's been on the broadcast media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| When Charles was selected to be the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| immediately there was great conversation in the print and broadcast media about this position in the community newspapers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4415)|
| 1:13:44| as well as the New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| It's been on the airways, certainly on the blogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| So I think anybody who was interested really should know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4429)|
| 1:13:59| Have you all haven't had anybody call after the deadline and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4439)|
| 1:14:09| Do you want to throw your name in the ring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| A couple of people, after hearing that conversation, said that I should nominate myself and resign from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4455)|
| 1:14:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| So I guess what I'm hearing then is that we collectively want to, because of the small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| that we collectively want to go ahead and go through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4474)|
| 1:14:39| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| I would simply say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| There's nothing wrong with what was suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| I would not like to have a situation where someone has no votes or one vote or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| I think that we ought to have somewhat like we all communicate to Cindy's office or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4492)|
| 1:14:58| and a list be prepared of the top eight or ten candidates or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| and we winnow it down that way rather than, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| maybe making it where it feels uncomfortable for someone to have been, I don't know what, rejected publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| We just talk about the people that we're going to have in the ring, and then we'll deal with it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| I think it's probably healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Yeah, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| I understand what you're saying about that, but if you think about it, when we voted on interim mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| when we voted on beer board, when we voted on vice mayor, we just went around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| and some of us got no votes and some of us got some votes, and so I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I wasn't talking about the actual voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| I think once we get to the short list, it's fair game to do everything publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| We need to do everything publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| Right, but I think if you have 18 people and all of us go around and, you know, Marshall Steyer's name comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| and he gets no votes, then he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| He missed the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| Well, no, but I'm using that as an example that, you know, when you apply for a job, you know what you're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| A lot of folks have applied for a public job where we've all agreed that it's going to be total transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4567)|
| 1:16:14| and so they know what they're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| And so if we go down the list and, you know, I have five people that come out at the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| those are the ones that are going to get the vote that I have, you know, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| So I understand on the one hand what you're saying, but on the other hand, this is a public position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| and everybody should be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| But they don't really know what they're getting into because we haven't set what the salary's going to be and the terms, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4594)|
| 1:16:42| Well, but what I'm saying is that they have publicly announced that they're interested in the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| But when you give the salary range, they may no longer be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| I mean, it's sort of like when we apply for an architectural project, they rank the firms, and we know where we're ranked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| And so then they start with number one, and they say, number one, the fee is this, the time frame is this, do you agree with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| And you either say yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| And if you say no, then you go to number two, and then that number two person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| So, I mean, it's all public, and so you know what you're getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| We don't know what the salary's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| We don't know what the hours are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| And you're right, we're not really quite sure what all this person's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| But as far as ranking the individuals that we now have, that's really what we're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| You know, you think it would be easier to do a job description based on Charles Swanson's contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| and say, here's what we propose to hire this position at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| Those that are interested, you know, I mean, we can present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I mean, I think you'd state that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| Here's our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| These are some of the things we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| Here's what we're going to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Here's what our expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Are you interested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| And if any of the 17 bail out, then now we're down to, you know, we've got a shorter list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| But, unfortunately, that's not how we did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| We're past the RFP, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| Let's go through the lots and then we'll have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| I tell you what, I'm going to go to Councilman Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Well, I mean, back to that heart of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| You know, regardless of the pay, I mean, I think it's been clearly stated that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| they're not going to come in at the same level that Charles went out at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| And, you know, it's not going to be a ridiculously low amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| If they're willing to be council's representative, then they will apply regardless of the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| And they know the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| I mean, 40 hours minimum, I believe, or 60 was approximately Charles's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| So I think we have a window there that most of these applicants know it's going to fall into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| And I think if they want to be that person, then they will apply anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| So and as far as, you know, I think a short list of if we are all narrowed down to, like, a top five, you know, we all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4731)|
| 1:19:00| I think once we all submit our top five choices, I have a good feeling that we all might agree without even talking about it per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4740)|
| 1:19:10| I think there's going to be a top five or a top seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| And that list will present itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| Really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| That's just some thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Councilman Wallace, I share your concern that initially when this was put out to the public, there was no job description, nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4761)|
| 1:19:29| But at the same time, most of the people are aware, at least a little bit in the legal community, what would be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4769)|
| 1:19:38| So I got over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| It was not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| But it did bother me that we didn't have a clear description of what we wanted this person to do, the number of hours and a pay range or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4780)|
| 1:19:49| That being said, I like Councilman DeLavoe's idea about emailing Cindy and putting her on the hot seat to deal with these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4789)|
| 1:19:58| not because she needs to be on the hot seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| But I'm also very concerned that we cannot have any appearance of any kind of back room conversations, actions, whether they occurred or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4800)|
| 1:20:14| not even any speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| I'm afraid that if we don't have another workshop to whittle this down and get the five people in here or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4816)|
| 1:20:25| I'm just really very concerned that the public will be very unhappy with us and rightly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4825)|
| 1:20:33| You can't do it electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| I don't think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| I have that same concern that Councilman Palmer has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| Here, right at this moment, we probably need some legal guidance, which we don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| But we need to be as transparent as possible as we go through this selection process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4853)|
| 1:20:58| If we have to do it all right here in public and where the applicants appear and make whatever statements they choose to make, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4858)|
| 1:21:07| As Councilman Grievous said, they know the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| They know what they've applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| I think as we render the minutes of this meeting and we discover what we have all said about the qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4871)|
| 1:21:19| and you add that to the agreement that we have been working under and we assume, or at least I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| that there's going to be something similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| I don't know where the dollars are going to fall out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| I think there are some parameters that can be quantified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| and that moving forward in a very public manner is not going to be that difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4894)|
| 1:21:40| Now, there may be moments of discomfort, but that's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| Councilman Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| Well, that was going to be my comment about the public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| when we finally get down to whatever number in terms of actual interview process, we'll have to have it public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4911)|
| 1:22:03| And if we select out of the 17 and we say, well, these are my top five, we're really going to have to see these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4923)|
| 1:22:13| You can't do it just based on the resume alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| So we'll have to see them and talk to them in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| And I guess that's why we're here now, to come up with a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| But it will have to be an open public process, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| Councilman Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| All I was going to suggest, and maybe I didn't make myself clear, was that when you listen to the criteria we all talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| if we had a process whereby we just sent our top five or six or whatever the number is to Cindy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| and she went through it, my guess is we're going to find the hits fall within a range of about ten people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| We have a half dozen people that have one, two, and three years' experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| and I just can't imagine that that's going to get nine votes on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| We might as well be interviewing the handful, whether it's five or eight people or ten people, right here publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| But we can cull this list down to a practical workable group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| and then see what these people have to say and have certainly an open and transparent process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4991)|
| 1:23:16| But I guess the question is, I don't know how you do that without it happening in this or the next wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=4996)|
| 1:23:25| Anybody can have the list that she has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5005)|
| 1:23:27| I mean, I'm just saying we could simply e-mail her and then she could make a table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| and the ones that got more than two or three or four nods would be in the winning circle to come interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5012)|
| 1:23:39| Are we going to interview 17 or 18 people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| I actually had 18 on my list because someone didn't show up on Susan's list, Barley Perry or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| He was through? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| He was not on that last list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| But, I mean, I'm not interested in interviewing more than about eight or ten of these people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| because we're just going to be wasting their time as well as our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| Well, that goes back to what I just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Then you've got to have some type of criteria that we would agree to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| that they have this much experience, that they do this, they do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| Otherwise, you stand all 17 right there and talk to them for ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| Or we talk about them out publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| We throw out a name and then we talk about them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| I mean, you cut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| I mean, I don't think e-mailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| I don't know. I don't know much about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| I don't think e-mailing Cindy a list of our top five would be the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| I don't think I could get it to a top five without seeing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| So you'd have to talk to them unless you have a specific criteria of what seasoning means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| and what it is you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| And I have had, I mean, I'll tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| I've had people that are here that have applied that have talked about salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5083)|
| 1:24:50| Salary is a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| I mean, you're overlooking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| They're not just going to take it just at whatever you give them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| And there's people that aren't on this list because of the comment that was in the paper that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| we're not going to hire them at $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| So maybe that was the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| But I'm telling you that, you know, that's a big part of any job is what I'm going to get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| Public services, I really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| I like that idea, the spirit of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| But what you're going to get paid has a lot to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5117)|
| 1:25:22| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| I'd certainly agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| And, you know, once we get into compensation, I think we can talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| And I said public service, but, you know, I certainly need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| You know, I think we need to figure out, I mean, we don't want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| it sounds like we don't want to interview everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| To me, I was sort of thinking along the lines of Councilman Campen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5143)|
| 1:25:47| Everyone would get three or five selections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5147)|
| 1:25:51| And then once everybody goes around the room and makes that, see how many we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| and then sort of go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| Instead of emailing it, just do it publicly, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| What are your five selections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5165)|
| 1:26:07| What are your five selections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| What are your five selections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| And there's going to be some overlap, most likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| Or there's going to have to be some overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| And I think that may eliminate some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| If we had just three selections, you know, and then that would eliminate some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| and we'd see where there's overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| So if I'm hearing you right, then we would stack rank them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| and then we're going to put a number, whatever the basement ceiling is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| Just throw in a number out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| If it was eight and everybody below eight is out, is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| We would just see the results and then see if anybody gets no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| Well, they're obviously eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| That's what I mean by stack ranking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Right, stack ranking them, how many votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| You know, if every person voted for, if all five, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| if all nine of us voted for the same five people, then we'd bring those five in for interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| You know, if there's, you know, probably to eight or nine, then we'd bring them all in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| and then just go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| And maybe you just do that process with a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| We're only bringing in eight people for interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| So the top eight vote-getters come in for interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| I mean, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| Because that's a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| It's transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| You know, we all looked at the resumes and letters, and it's very open of who everyone's choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5251)|
| 1:27:38| I mean, you could make it more complicated where we would get points or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| and the first person we vote for gets five points, the second gets four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| But we're just doing resumes right now, and I think the interview is more important, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| in how we feel about that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| I think at some level we have got to talk to all of these folks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| That may be individually, but once again, I agree with Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5286)|
| 1:28:12| There's got to be some parameters, and I think we've established those, at least in a loose way tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| and especially if you combine it with the essence of this, not the dollars on this contract, but the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5297)|
| 1:28:25| When you put all that together, I'm very comfortable either having coffee with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| as many as want to talk to me personally, or if we want to ask them to come here and talk to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| that's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| But somehow I've got to have a sense of who that person is, because some of these attorneys I do know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| but many of them I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| And I think in all fairness to them and to what we come out with ultimately, we need that contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5325)|
| 1:28:53| And I think from a public standpoint, we have got to be open, very open with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5333)|
| 1:29:00| I'm very comfortable, even though it may take us some time and it may take their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5340)|
| 1:29:05| That's just part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Councilman Canton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Yeah, just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| I didn't mean to make light of the salary, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| I agree that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| I think there is a window that is understood it will fall within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| And, you know, as far as time, if we were to interview everybody, I mean, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| I think it should be public and open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| If they all stood up for five minutes and spoke with us, I would be fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5366)|
| 1:29:31| We're talking an hour and 15, hour and 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| You know, that would be one way to see everybody, put a name with a face, and have an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| And then we submit our short list and vote from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| You know, that's my two cents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Councilman Bryant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| I think one thing we might use is the process somewhat similar when we select a replacement for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5391)|
| 1:30:01| like the fifth district and all of those persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| It may take some time, but all of those we've cut it off already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5405)|
| 1:30:09| It's 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| And it's going to have to be some fairness and openness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5411)|
| 1:30:19| So the only way to do it, the people are going to have to either come maybe not right here, council office or somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5419)|
| 1:30:26| and we can talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| It's going to take a little time, but I don't see any other way to be fair to all of those people who have applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5427)|
| 1:30:35| other than seeing them and talking to them along with their resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5435)|
| 1:30:40| And I think the process we use for selecting council replacements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5440)|
| 1:30:45| which has been done through the years, might be something that we could look at as a sort of guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5445)|
| 1:30:55| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| I was going to say, yeah, Mayor Brown, I think that that's a good example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| or a good thing to use in that we did have those people come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5461)|
| 1:31:04| and they talked and we found out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| At least we got the beginning to feel like we got to know who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| But now the only thing that I would say to that is that, and not to prejudice anyone else's mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5469)|
| 1:31:16| but there are a couple on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| For instance, if it's important that the person lives and works in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5478)|
| 1:31:22| I think right away there are several that are off the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| That those would not, I mean, if we all agree that that's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| then we've narrowed it down to maybe 14 or 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| And so there might be some things that we need to talk about to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| But I'd definitely be in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| I know it's going to take longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| But, again, this is pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| This is our legal counsel, and we want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| Also, I don't mean to make light of the salary either, George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| but to me that is the bottom of the list because we're going to end up finding out the four or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5509)|
| 1:31:57| that we think are at the tops and you start negotiating with that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| And if that person doesn't like the fact that they're getting X number of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| and we know that we've got a second candidate that's as good, then we go to the second candidate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| I think that also, I think Vice Mayor Pavlis' comment came out after the deadline for the applications anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5530)|
| 1:32:20| It was in Monday's paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| So I think these people that applied realized that it is something that they're going to have to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| So, again, not to talk lightly about it, but to me that's not high on my priority list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| And always keep in mind without five votes you can't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| When we're talking to paperettes, you're talking individually, not collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| Just remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| I'm just saying that, you know, there may be people that may or may not be interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| They're thinking 90,000 and you're thinking, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| I mean, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| I think you ought to stand them all up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| You know, 17 people have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| You've made it a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| You put them all up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| Let them speak for a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| And then we cut the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| And then we cut it based on what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| I really can't, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| Other than that, we'll just have to go around the horn and go name by name if you want to eliminate some tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| But I still think you ought to have a. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| I've never hired anybody without a job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| The job always goes beyond that job description, but there is certainly. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| These are the expectations, and that would be presented at that first meeting, that would be my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| And, you know, Charles's line was probably lit up very quickly after that RFP didn't go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5607)|
| 1:33:35| but when it was posted and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| And, you know, I was upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| I'll be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| And he said, Nick, you know, attorneys, they realize what that job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| I said, well, because it was just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| We just got through hiring the executive director of the Cable Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| We had all these qualifications, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| He says, they know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| And, you know, he assured me of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Now, there's probably some interested people in this audience that I haven't seen hit the door yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| So, you know, which tells me that we're probably going down a pretty good path here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5642)|
| 1:34:08| So, anyway, I'll recognize Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| Well, oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| I'm trying to come up with a couple of scenarios to incorporate what everybody wants to have happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| And one of the things, we have this list that are in the minutes of things that we think are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| And so would it be possible at the next council meeting we could bring this forth as a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| with these qualifications, what we're looking for in the people, the seasoning or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5678)|
| 1:34:46| that we have that in some form of resolution so that people would then know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| And then the next workshop date is two weeks from today because we workshop every other Thursday, in theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5691)|
| 1:34:59| And I think this room is reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| And at that point, we have the resolution and we would know if we decide that they need to live at least in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5701)|
| 1:35:09| that would eliminate some of those applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| But that we have the people come into the workshop and, as some of my colleagues have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| give them five minutes to sell yourself through your five-minute elevator speech or three-minute elevator speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| And then at the end of that time, we could probably be ready to move forward in some fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| I'm just throwing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| Along those same lines, we identified, I think you were writing down, we identified certain characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5738)|
| 1:35:46| Could we not do that this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| In other words, you could go ahead and tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| There may be some others that need to be added to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| But if we knew what they are, what we could do, then each of us could rank them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| and we could go ahead and see where those are now so that we can move this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| I'm not sure that we need a resolution is, I guess, my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| But if we have those, if you could repeat what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| There may be some others that we don't have on the list yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Maybe it's something that we could go ahead and, you know, speed this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| I'm all for speeding this up, but I don't think that at a workshop we can come to some kind of formal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5779)|
| 1:36:27| Well, but do you feel comfortable that you know what the five or six qualifications are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| that we're going to try to put in a resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5791)|
| 1:36:33| Well, I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| I mean, I don't even remember what they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| I've got a partial list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| They're apolitical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| They live in Knoxville or at least Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| They're available after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| They are seasoned, meaning that they are somewhat experienced or a veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| They can work with all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| They have a public service attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| They have a backup to come to council if they can't come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| And then I lost count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| What did I leave out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Well, can we go ahead and rank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| I mean, is there a reason we can't go ahead and rank those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| And maybe there's something else I didn't get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| I don't believe that we can vote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| We can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| We can spitball but not act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| That was why I suggested that if we have this list and we bring it forth as a resolution on Tuesday night, then we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5842)|
| 1:37:30| But do you want to go ahead and rank those for the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| Or are you just going to shotgun it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| I mean, we've talked about this and this thing around the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| It seems that we're fairly in agreement about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5864)|
| 1:37:45| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| Let me just say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| I think we're treading on thin ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| I think we're on thin ice right here by wanting to take this, I think, a step further than we're able to really take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5870)|
| 1:38:00| And, boy, do we need to get this process done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| You've got a guy that's been in the cable business for a while telling you, giving you some legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| It's just gut feeling that we're probably on thin ice here by doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| By doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Let me just say this, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| From what I'm hearing, I've heard, I think, more than four or five times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| that the best process is going to be to bring people in here, just like we did when we replaced the fifth district representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| not the mayor, not the vice mayor the last time, but the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| And we interviewed them, and we went around and around and around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| It's public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| I don't know how we can do a better job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| It's a little bit more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| And that's why, initially, I had thrown out to get the smaller committee and then bring it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| And that's the only reason I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| But, I mean, I've heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| I don't know that I could count five, but I think I could count five times that that's how we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5937)|
| 1:39:03| And I can't think of a more open process than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| But it's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| You're going to bring in all 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| I think that's the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| To me, that's, you know, I would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| I would just say that that's, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5963)|
| 1:39:24| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| You don't need a motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| I had one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| Let's ask Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| I'll get him on speed dial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5975)|
| 1:39:39| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5979)|
| 1:39:40| No, I was going to say that, well, apparently we can't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| See, we need Charles here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| We can't make a motion at a workshop, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5985)|
| 1:39:47| No, we're not taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| I mean, but I think that's what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Well, what I was going to say, I'm in favor of having, I mean, if you want to go around the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| I'm in favor of having all 17 come before us and let's do it the way we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| Yeah, it's not mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| And there may be some who read the minutes or hear this discussion or watched it on TV or look at the video,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6001)|
| 1:40:09| and they've heard this discussion and they might self-select out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| So we really might not have 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| But I would encourage us to invite all 17 and do it two weeks from tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6015)|
| 1:40:21| Well, let's, I don't know, let's do a poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| I don't have my calendar in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| We can send out, you know, an e-mail, as we normally do, to find out what the best dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| We'll send out a couple of dates perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Do we want to do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| Do we want to do it at a regular workshop time, or do we want to do it at a, you know, if you bring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6038)|
| 1:40:46| it's going to be a long process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6046)|
| 1:40:48| If we start at five, we may be here to, you know, a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Vice Mayor Pavlis, that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| I'm certainly in favor of bringing everybody in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| We're going to, in one night, will it from 17 down to one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| or do we want to go to 17 and down to three or five and kind of have extended interviews with those candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6062)|
| 1:41:10| I mean, I'm not, I mean, I think we can get it down to one in one night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| I just wanted to be clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| I'd rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| I'd rather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| I'd say winning it down to five, and then we have to have more extensive interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| I think down to three or five, depending on how they shake out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6090)|
| 1:41:34| Whatever the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| So not whittle it down from 17 to one in one night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| Hold on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| I was just going to agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| I don't think we would get from 17 to one that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6103)|
| 1:41:48| but we would have an opportunity to hear from everybody that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| and we can make selection later, not that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| So we're going to hear from everyone and whittle it down that night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| Or I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| That's what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| But to how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| To five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| To five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Well, I think we should make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| And I'm not stuck on five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| I thought for some reason I was understanding we were going to select one that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6139)|
| 1:42:27| When we did the district five, I mean, we did whittle it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6147)|
| 1:42:34| I don't remember how many applicants we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| but we did get it whittled down to one person that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6156)|
| 1:42:40| I mean, we would be here a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| Councilman Delmo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| Here's the problem, and let me put it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| We're going to give people five minutes or something at a podium to tell us a little bit about themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| and see how they handle themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| You're picking an attorney, an advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| I think when you get down to the small handful, whatever the magic number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| we're going to want to be a little more extensive in asking them questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| and grilling them and getting more information about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| And I don't think we're going to have time for much question and answer the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| So we're going to want to question the people that are in the top group, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| That's a normal process in an interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| I mean, that's the way it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| I was just going to suggest maybe we could not try to do it all in one night, all 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6209)|
| 1:43:35| Maybe we split that up in two nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| Well, it would just be, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| Councilman Brown has something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| I was just going to say it would just be, I mean, really an hour and a half to hear from everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| if they get five minutes each with a little wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| So I think it wouldn't take all night just to hear the initial, see you, put your name in the face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6231)|
| 1:43:56| and hear from them, and then we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6236)|
| 1:44:04| Councilman Saunders, you look like you're going to grab the mic there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| Are we looking at the 20?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| So if I'm, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Well, the next, what Councilwoman Palmer had recommended would be the 19th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| Just for your information, and it's not something we must go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| but the school superintendent is doing a state of the schools address that night at Gresham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| And I don't know how many people would like to attend, but I think our relationship with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6280)|
| 1:44:46| we need a better relationship with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| So that may be an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| And that's why we'll poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| We'll give some dates, and we'll figure the date out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6293)|
| 1:45:02| So what I'm hearing then is that we're going to find a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| We're going to bring the 17 candidates in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| We're going to listen to them for approximately five minutes per candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| And then are we going to perhaps lessen the list that evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6315)|
| 1:45:22| or are we going to come back at another time and deliberate and say, okay, I think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6322)|
| 1:45:29| and then start the voting process or, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| Well, I do assume during that process that we will have an opportunity to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| and, you know, clarify things or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| So five minutes, it will end up considerably longer than five minutes per generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| Well, I think it would on some, and I think it would on some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| It will probably be pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| But, I mean, I don't know how you do it and not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| Oh, we just have to devote the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| It's going to be a long night, but this is a hard job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| I think that's what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| We would then vote that night and say, okay, who are we going to eliminate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| Who are going to be our top five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| We'd vote right then while it's fresh on our mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| And then you'd set a date and come back and interview the other ones extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| And it may take you more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6378)|
| 1:46:20| You need 20 or 30 minutes with your top five, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| Yeah, I think you're a bit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| So we'll find a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| We'll interview all the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| We'll make a vote that night to take it to what's the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6393)|
| 1:46:38| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| And then we'll go with a second round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| You know, we'll come up with a date for a second round of interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| Councilman Starr is recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| Well, I just wanted to clarify how we're going to do the voting that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| Will we just each get one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6414)|
| 1:46:56| I mean, because I don't mean to drag this meeting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| This is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| I think we should have it very clear when we come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| This is what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| The 17 people are going to speak for five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| And then we're going to have a process of how we're going to vote and have that very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| And if everybody gets three votes or five votes, and then we whittle it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6437)|
| 1:47:26| I wasn't here for that process with the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| But it's considerably different with 17 applicants versus four or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| So maybe everybody gets five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| I just think we need to have it be clear of how the voting is going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6460)|
| 1:47:45| I hope this isn't getting more painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| We should have, like, just a blackboard or a chart she can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| And after we've heard all 17, each person will say they're five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| And someone will make a tote sheet, and we'll be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| I mean, we're going to end up with a top five when we get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| If five people want these five, then they're coming in, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| So, in other words, you're saying that the top, if one person gets five votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| the next person gets three votes, two and one, those are the ones that advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6492)|
| 1:48:18| I was just saying that if you have a list of 17 names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| the ones that have the most ticks next to them come back that are five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| But I think he's saying, I think you're saying that we, in essence, we have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| Each of us have five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| You say five people you want to see on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| And then you count up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| And someone's got a tote sheet where they're making marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Someone could have nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Some of them are going to have a lot of votes, and some of them are going to have no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| You know, that's what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| It would be pretty clear at that point who the five are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| I mean, just looking around this room now, there's probably three or four names on that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6528)|
| 1:48:54| that will be on virtually all nine of our lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| If you're narrowing it to five, I don't know how you could have less than five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| Well, that's what I'm saying, that we have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| I just wanted to clear about how many votes each council member had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| And are we sure we want to just limit it to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| Do we want to go to three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6555)|
| 1:49:20| 17 to five, you're only eliminating 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6560)|
| 1:49:26| There's quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| I mean, I'm hearing five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| If we want to go less, it's whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I'm hearing five, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| Do we each get five votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| I like Nick's idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| Everybody gets five votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| Tick sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| Tick sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| The top five vote getters, those are the ones we call back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| And in case of a tie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| All ties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Hold on, we're going to go by the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| We can end up with six if that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| The other thing, and I don't know why you couldn't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| if you send each of these persons a letter inviting them to whatever date we're having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| put down some of the criteria that's been talked about by the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| because some people will self-deselect when they see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| If we decide that it's an important criteria that they be Knoxvillians or Knoxcountians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6607)|
| 1:50:13| two people fall out from that list automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| Now, maybe they can come and make their case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| but they're going to see that that's an important criteria they have to overcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| and they should be prepared to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| If we say they want more than, you know, two or three years' experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| there's another four or five people that are going to fall off that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| We may be able to shorten it down to what makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| You don't have to rank order anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| You can just say that the council members talked about blah, blah, blah, and blah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| as desirable characteristics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Come tell us what you got to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| I mean, you know, and get that letter out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| Let's hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6643)|
| 1:50:44| If they want to come talk, we'll hear everyone that wants to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Well, I mean, I think, but, though, that's why you have the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| I didn't hear unanimously that they had to be a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| So when that person who, if it's not that important to that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| then they're going to vote accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| I think, along with what Nick is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| is that the letters that you send to invite these people can summarize what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| that council talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| or they could get the minutes of tonight's meeting could be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| that says these are the things that they talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| that we haven't really eliminated anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| I mean, what may be important to me may not be important to Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| But if they get a letter stating that this is what was talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6684)|
| 1:51:28| somebody that maybe is just fresh out of law school reads that and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| hmm, they're looking for experience, you know, type of thing, that you do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| But that would be in the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| I'm fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| If nothing else, they could then emphasize why that's not important in their case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6702)|
| 1:51:47| because they have some other skill that makes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Well, they may be ready to move to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| You know, we'd find them a new home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| The Wallace Company could get an apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| Uh-oh, uh-oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6718)|
| 1:51:59| Whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6719)|
| 1:52:00| Let's stay with the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| I want to try to keep order here as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6724)|
| 1:52:11| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6731)|
| 1:52:12| Mr. Mayor, I just wanted to say that maybe we'd better be cautious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| about having two lawyers sitting next to one another, just as a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6735)|
| 1:52:20| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| I do think that we've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| Would you summarize where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| Well, I think that we're going to have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| One of the things that I emphasize, let's please, let's be very diligent about answering the time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| as to when we can meet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| That's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| I can see right now this is going to take us a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| So I will talk with Charles in the interim and find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| I mean, we've got to have a person here that can guide us with legal experience other than myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| I mean, we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Well, I mean, there's, you know, I just felt like at times at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6780)|
| 1:53:03| tonight we're on thin ice and we don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| And so with respect to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| Could we not ask the backup, Charles' backup?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| And I think he would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| I think he would do that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| So we're going to have another workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| Then we're going to bring the applicants, all the applicants in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| We're going to inform them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| I'm not sure how we dictate or how we do this letter because it's not unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6808)|
| 1:53:36| These are, I guess we could do bullet points, or these were some of the issues that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| qualifications that we felt were important for the person to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6821)|
| 1:53:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| They will come and be prepared to present for five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| and be prepared to answer questions that evening or that day, whenever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6833)|
| 1:53:59| And then we will vote that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| Each member of council will have five votes for the 17 or eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6842)|
| 1:54:10| however many applicants there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| And then we will do a second round of in-depth interviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6853)|
| 1:54:19| That's how I understand that we're, that's where I understand we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| I was just going to say that with how important this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| and that there is a potential conflict on the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| that possible dates could also be the 12th and the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| which I realize that's the same Thursday that we have a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| But because of the importance of this, let's not put this off two weeks after the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| which puts it into February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| Well, and if those other Thursdays work, I'm willing to, let's say, look at those dates also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6887)|
| 1:54:54| And it doesn't necessarily just have to be this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6894)|
| 1:54:56| I mean, this is, you know, one time in 28 years we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| So, I mean, if it's a non-workshop night, well, we may just have to do a non-workshop night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| And it may be a Saturday or off time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| Who knows what it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Yeah, that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| Let's not just say that it has to be work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| Councilman Campen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6912)|
| 1:55:13| Just looking at the agenda, we might save 15 minutes right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6913)|
| 1:55:17| We've got a few people in the office that are in the audience that might want to talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6917)|
| 1:55:22| Well, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| We have to stick to what we posted as the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6923)|
| 1:55:28| Good idea, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| Well, we have a public forum tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| Oh, well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6932)|
| 1:55:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| Did we want to clarify what we're going to do after we narrow it down to five, how that process is going to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| Well, what we had talked about was more intense interview or, you know, just the second round, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6943)|
| 1:55:52| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| I mean, it would be more, in my mind, it would be more of a Q&A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Because we'll know their qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| We'll have heard them, allow them perhaps two minutes to kind of come up and reintroduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| But then we will start an interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| So there would be another night scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| The five would return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| And then that night we would narrow it from five to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| And in that process would we just have one vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| You would just have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Because I think what we're trying to do today is just get the process, how we get to 17 to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6986)|
| 1:56:35| Yeah, if you've got it narrowed to five, it's going to be pretty quick then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=6995)|
| 1:56:42| If you've got nine votes and five applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| But, you know, that's the way we did it in the fifth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7008)|
| 1:56:49| I think there was three, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Three rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7011)|
| 1:56:52| Three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7012)|
| 1:56:53| Three rounds, four rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| And I think the good part about that is the first night, when we have 17, we can really limit the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| You know, unless something's really burning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| You know, I think that we're going to really, I think we'll go through this pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| I think it will be pretty obvious, not only to us, but the applicant themselves, that perhaps they're not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| they're not the chosen person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| Any further discussion, process, anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7040)|
| 1:57:24| I appreciate your all's diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| Counselor Medell-Bopen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| In this letter that you were sending, someone was going to write, thank them all for participating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7047)|
| 1:57:32| That's certainly, we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7052)|
| 1:57:34| But then go on and say, we've discussed some of these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| Here's what we're going to do, and tell them the process, and invite them to come ready to fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| But thank them all for their, you know, for their effort of responding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7069)|
| 1:57:50| We do thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7070)|
| 1:57:52| I just have one last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| And I guess we've agreed to discuss the salary and that thing after we make the selection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7073)|
| 1:58:03| The initial selections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Or just when do we have that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7086)|
| 1:58:11| Because I think that's also something the public would be interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| I think once we get to five, and we interview those five, and we rank those five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7095)|
| 1:58:22| that's when you sit down and you negotiate with whoever that person is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| Because it could be somebody that maybe $100 an hour means something to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| whereas someone else is a $250 an hour type of person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| So I think that that's part of the negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| They know what the range is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| And so I think that that comes with negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| I don't think that that's something that you go out there publicly and say right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| They don't know the range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| I mean, I don't know what the range is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| I don't know what the range is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| But as far as I'm concerned, the range is zero to $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| Zero is going to limit it and lumber it to $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| Let me recognize Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| Well, I don't think you know what the range is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7142)|
| 1:59:04| And you don't even know, you know, is it $90,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| Is that the highest or the lowest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| I mean, you just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| I don't know that we've ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| I don't know that you haven't set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| You haven't set a range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| But I would think you'd get to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| You interview the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| And then you're going to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| I think it's at that time you're going to establish, based on the criteria that you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7161)|
| 1:59:25| based on people you see, you're going to say, okay, they're going to come up with it, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7165)|
| 1:59:31| They're not being elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| I mean, they're taking a job, and they're going to want to know what they're going to get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| But that will be in the second round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| The second interview, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Yeah, this is what the job entails, and, you know, this is the salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7182)|
| 1:59:50| You either want it or don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7192)|
| 1:59:53| Councilman Starr, if that was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| Yeah, I mean, sit down and, I mean, the whole thing, sit down and negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| I mean, I just don't know what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| This is my first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7203)|
| 2:00:04| Does that mean they sit out there and the nine of us say, okay, what's your normal salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| I mean, to me it's almost easier, and this is just my opinion, I don't know where everybody else is on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| to almost set it before we select someone and say this is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7214)|
| 2:00:24| Because, you know, I've just, and this is new to me, and it's new to, I guess, everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7224)|
| 2:00:28| but to negotiate in public, and I just don't know how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| I don't know what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| I mean, if I think I'm hearing both of you right, we're going to will it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7239)|
| 2:00:47| and then after, once we get it to the five applicants, we will come with the contract and a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7247)|
| 2:00:55| And this is what the job, you can't, it's not like private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| I mean, you know, when you go through the second rounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7260)|
| 2:01:03| then generally that's when you talk about compensation, you talk about, you know, benefits and that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7263)|
| 2:01:08| You don't talk about that on the front end, and this is what the job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| But we don't have that luxury because this is, you know, this is an open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| You know, I don't think one, I don't know how you could do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| and one be 85, one be 125.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| I mean, you know, in my mind, this is what the job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| But I'm open to listen to what everybody has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| You know, again, what I refer back to is, like, when we do work for PBA, or when we did work for PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7292)|
| 2:01:39| you did, you put in what you would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| And if you were number one, and that, which is what you would like to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7304)|
| 2:01:48| wasn't what they were willing to pay, then there was a negotiation that went on between you and PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7308)|
| 2:01:55| So what it is, is what you're trying to do is you're trying to get the best person first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7315)|
| 2:02:01| and then you work on the, whatever the salary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| And, you know, we can tell these lawyers they're going to get at least what we get paid, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| They need a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| You don't talk about public service, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| Plus they'll have to pay for their own parking, too, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| But what I'm saying is, to me, the crucial thing is to get the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| And find out those five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| Then the crucial thing is, what is an attorney in this position, what are they paid, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| with the amount of experience they have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| We may have somebody that might have ten years' experience that when we go out into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| and find out what a lawyer like that ought to be paid, or we check with other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| and find out what they're paid, or this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| So I think we're kind of beating a dead horse right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| What we need to do is we need to get down to the five and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| then go from there and make a decision on what it is we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| Dovetailing on what Councilman Grieve said, I don't know how the contracts with Charles were negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| I suspect they were not negotiated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| And so there should be something similar in the process that he's described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7388)|
| 2:03:13| Basically, the attorney might approach us with, here's what I'm willing to do the job for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7393)|
| 2:03:17| And then we make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| So perhaps I'm not comfortable negotiating salary in public like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7399)|
| 2:03:27| And I guess I'm hearing words that don't quite square with what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| And that is, this is an independent contractor getting a retainer agreement to provide so many hours of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7413)|
| 2:03:40| And it's going to be based, lawyers are used to setting fees based on their experience level, the difficulty of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| There's actually a canon of ethic that lists, you know, the factors that you consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| But they're very comfortable with talking about their own worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7432)|
| 2:03:57| And we are not hiring an employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7437)|
| 2:03:59| It's a retainer for a professional as an independent contractor to come and spend some of their time helping us solve our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| So this is not a full-time job for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7447)|
| 2:04:09| This is a part-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| It's a great thing if you've got a law firm and you want to have part of the income for the month guaranteed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7451)|
| 2:04:17| because we're probably a pretty good payer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| We're probably better than most clients sending checks out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| You know, I mean, you don't have to write three times and beg for your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| So we'll be finding someone who wants this job, and then we'll have a level of experience and expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7465)|
| 2:04:31| I don't think it's going to be that hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| I'll say, to answer your question, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| the vice mayor has been the one that negotiated those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| I mean, that's been the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7479)|
| 2:04:41| But, you know, this is a little bit unusual, but that's the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| So, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7487)|
| 2:04:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| I believe that Charles told us that when he was hired, he did write his contract and bring it to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7489)|
| 2:04:56| And then each year or every two years, however often it was renewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| that was a vice mayor negotiation based on his experience and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7501)|
| 2:05:07| But, initially, he came forth with the contract because there really wasn't one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7507)|
| 2:05:13| And he wrote the contract, and that contract we were all looking at is the one he wrote 28 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7513)|
| 2:05:21| I think it's been amended, you know, a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| But that's the basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| That's the basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| Councilman Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| I just wanted to say that I think that in listening to all my colleagues this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| and especially on this issue, that, number one, we all know how important this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7534)|
| 2:05:38| Number two, I think we're all willing to work extra hard to make sure that we get the right person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| And, number three, we all want to be involved in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| And I think that once we get through those first five, that with what we've come up with in terms of working like we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| with the fifth district, that our candidate, that it's going to come out that we're going to be in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7553)|
| 2:06:00| And part of that has to do with the commitment that all of us have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7560)|
| 2:06:04| And I think it really shows tonight that that's what we're concerned about with all the questions that we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7564)|
| 2:06:09| And so I feel real good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| And I think that we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| And when I say we need to move forward quickly, I don't necessarily mean we're bypassing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| It's just that if we have some dates, whether it's Tuesday after council meeting or Saturday, like you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| I think it's important that we get this person on board as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| But, again, I want to commend all my colleagues on the sincerity in which all of us have acted tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7595)|
| 2:06:36| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| Well, I just want to kind of agree with you, Councilman, and I think when it's all said and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| when we get through this process, looking at the resumes, and I have not read all of them, but I've read many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7602)|
| 2:06:48| I think we're going to get a good person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| It's just a matter of getting there, and I think we're going to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| We'll get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| We've got to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| I think that's probably we've vetted this pretty good this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| We do have a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| Nobody signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| Recognize Hubert Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7630)|
| 2:07:12| Five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7635)|
| 2:07:16| 2323 Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7636)|
| 2:07:18| I seldom, rarely speak, but listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| But after hearing this conversation, I had to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| I guess the first thing I would say to ask each of you, how long are you willing to sit here at city council without council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7645)|
| 2:07:32| C-O-U-N-S-E-L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7652)|
| 2:07:34| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7654)|
| 2:07:35| If tonight is not an example, you need to get this done with some urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7655)|
| 2:07:39| I don't know who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7659)|
| 2:07:40| One thing is for sure, there won't be any 30-minute council meetings for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| If you say you haven't read the resumes by now, it tells me you haven't done your due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7665)|
| 2:07:49| Does anybody think that just today you found out that you needed council for your body and you haven't pursued that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7669)|
| 2:07:57| Or, I won't ask you, but I'll say it rhetorically, have any of you not received phone calls and have talked with people that are interested in the job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| I heard one person admit it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| So this wheel is not having to be recreated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7688)|
| 2:08:12| Now, I know it may not be a good comparison, but I've seen your county commission colleagues choose vacancies in much less time than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7692)|
| 2:08:23| I'm not saying they're the best example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7703)|
| 2:08:25| However, at their last council meeting, they chose a magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7705)|
| 2:08:30| You put down who you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| They get votes or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| They make the cut or they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7714)|
| 2:08:36| And you make the decision and you move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| They're working for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| Let me go back to some very, very early things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| I've got so many asterisks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| Let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| To me, if someone doesn't come with the ability to know zoning, Robert's Rules of Order, and have a familiarity with MPC, they shouldn't even be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7728)|
| 2:09:02| The rest of the stuff doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7742)|
| 2:09:04| Where they live, what does that matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7744)|
| 2:09:08| I can't speak scripture and verse right now, but you've had department heads in this city for many, many years who didn't live in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| I don't see how it affected them from doing their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| The main thing you want to know is that they're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| Maybe having an office downtown or somewhere close might be a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| But if they can't keep you all in line as a body and tell you when you're speaking out of order or the decisions that they make be able to defend them in court, then I don't think they should even be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7765)|
| 2:09:36| I don't see where this is as difficult to process as some of you might be making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| I don't know what's so significant about five, and I think now you only have 17 people, not 16, not 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7781)|
| 2:09:48| I think one person has dropped out, but that's really secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7788)|
| 2:09:52| But I think you should set a time when this is to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7792)|
| 2:09:58| You make recommendations as to who you like individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7798)|
| 2:10:02| And if you don't like them, you don't recommend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| And then you vote on the people that each of you like collectively and get down to someone that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| And then the vice mayor negotiates the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7810)|
| 2:10:12| And you move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| But, again, I go back to my basic question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| How many council meetings are you all willing to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| Now, you may have a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7818)|
| 2:10:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7819)|
| 2:10:20| But this is something that you need to be done urgently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| And I would say you're going to be getting phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7823)|
| 2:10:25| Everybody should know what Charles Swanson was making, his public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| You know it's north of something and south of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| And if you all don't know, you all haven't been doing your jobs, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7831)|
| 2:10:37| So let's see what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| And Mr. Pavlis, tell me when I'm out of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7840)|
| 2:10:42| I'm looking to see if it's something I really want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7842)|
| 2:10:44| But where they live, eh, community service, I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| But you can do community service if you live in Granger County, Cott County, wherever the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| Just throwing some out as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| Timetable, I think you need to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| I think everybody who applied for this position probably at one time or another has called Charles Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7858)|
| 2:11:03| and said, hey, what were you making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7863)|
| 2:11:05| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| I mean, that's kind of what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| You all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7868)|
| 2:11:09| You attorneys up there know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7869)|
| 2:11:11| So I urge you to not make this any harder than it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| Now, with all due respect, Mr. Saunders, the school superintendent giving a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7874)|
| 2:11:21| I mean, this body has no legislative authority over Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7881)|
| 2:11:24| Certainly the city of Knoxville contributes a fair amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7884)|
| 2:11:27| But I don't think it should come in the way of you all choosing what you need to do in terms of selecting someone to represent you as your legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7887)|
| 2:11:37| Thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7898)|
| 2:11:39| Appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| No further business before this following night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7902)|
| 2:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop120105?start=7911)|
