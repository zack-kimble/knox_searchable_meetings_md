| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=0)|
| 0:00:31| We've already had our moment of silence and Pledge of Allegiance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=31)|
| 0:00:35| so we're going to just jump right into this called meeting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| This called meeting is in regard to, well, before I get into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| first I wanted just to, in case anybody's just now joining us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=45)|
| 0:00:48| I want to congratulate again our newly elected board chair, Christy Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| and our newly elected vice chair, Ebony Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=52)|
| 0:00:55| and they will begin chairing meetings next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| So they will be, they'll do that next week. So congratulations again, ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| So before we move into the agenda for this called meeting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| regarding COVID matters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=69)|
| 0:01:11| I wanted to start just by asking everyone here to be courteous and respectful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| to one another. As we've seen over the last few months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| there are many different opinions and viewpoints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| but we must remember that everyone here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=82)|
| 0:01:25| everyone is here for the best interest of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| And the children are watching and listening to us as adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=89)|
| 0:01:33| So it's important how we treat one another and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| and how we handle these difficult issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=96)|
| 0:01:39| We do have 60 speakers this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=99)|
| 0:01:41| And as always, if anyone is not complying with the board's civility code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=101)|
| 0:01:46| they will be asked to leave and escorted out if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=106)|
| 0:01:51| because we must maintain order to be able to get through our agenda and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| complete our work. So thank you in advance to everyone who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| Thank you for engaging and for your passion and your cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| Do we have any changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=123)|
| 0:02:06| I will just note that Ms. Babb has withdrawn her item number 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=126)|
| 0:02:12| And did you want to make any comment on that or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| I just felt like there was another motion made by another board member that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| kind of covered the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| and I didn't really see the point in the two being on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| Great. Any other changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| I just wanted to state that because this is a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| no other motions can be added,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| but motions to amend or substitute a motion that's already on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=158)|
| 0:02:44| or an agenda item that's already on the agenda can certainly be entertained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to make amendments to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| I move that we allow 90 seconds for each public forum speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Okay. There's a motion to amend public forum to 90 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| For each of the 60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| For each of the 60 speakers. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Any question? I'm sorry, Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| Yeah. We've debated this over and over in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=193)|
| 0:03:17| and when we tried to move it down to three minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=197)|
| 0:03:19| we were met with quite an outcry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| I just think that's pretty extreme, 90 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=202)|
| 0:03:26| Regardless of what side these people take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| I think people have prepared their speeches according to the guidelines that we have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=209)|
| 0:03:35| and I think that 90 seconds would be just really a hardship on a lot of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=215)|
| 0:03:42| especially because so many people that come before this board are not public speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| They just want to share their story or their, you know, what they believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| and it's hard enough to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| and when you have to look down and wipe out four-fifths of your speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| then I think that would be a very big hardship on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| So, you know, I sat here until 1.30 one evening, and, you know, we kept it at 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=243)|
| 0:04:11| which I think was very wise, but I don't think it's wise to change it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| Thank you, Ms. Bounds. Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| Board Member Bows, would you make a friendly amendment to lift it higher than 90| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| but less than what we have? I'm asking. I'm open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| What do we have right now? Are we at three or five still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| We're at 90 still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| 90 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Oh, okay, the traditional. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| What were they expecting to be able to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Five. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| I would be willing to go with three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| I think that cuts time off and kind of halfway between yours and mine or what we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| Did you say three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| I'll accept that friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| Any other comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Mr. McMillan, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| You made the second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| I made the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Are you okay with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| I just think that most of these people have been before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| and there are only so many points that you can make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=319)|
| 0:05:28| and I think a couple of minutes would be enough to state what you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| I know there's a local person on the radio that's doing this very same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=334)|
| 0:05:43| and he's only allowing 90 seconds for anybody to just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=343)|
| 0:05:49| it's kind of like get it and quit it, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Just tell what your reasons are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| If you have five reasons, just go down through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| You don't need a big paragraph with each one in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Ms. Bounds, would you like to speak before I ask Mr. McMillan his question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| Well, I really respect both of these colleagues and agree with both of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| and we have heard multiple people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| and I think the last count I got today was over 300 emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| So I do think we have allowed the public to voice their opinions on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=379)|
| 0:06:24| and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| and I do agree with Mike that we've heard over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| but I just think to decide it right now would be very detrimental to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=399)|
| 0:06:41| On a border, there are people out there yelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=401)|
| 0:06:44| Are they allowed to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| No, they are not, and I saw a police officer head that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Can we have order in the other room, please, so that we can not be distracted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=417)|
| 0:06:58| I mean, I understand that we have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=418)|
| 0:06:59| We did have a meeting recently where we allowed three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| and I thought everyone was very able to make their points eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| I do think 90 seconds is a little too short, but I do support the three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| Okay, and I think we're back to Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Would you be willing to accept the friendly amendment that you've seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| Okay, so that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| Mr. McMillan has withdrawn his second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Okay, so Mr. Watson is seconding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| So we now have three minutes for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| Yeah, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| All right, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=471)|
| 0:07:53| This is a roll call vote on allowing public forum speakers three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=485)|

| 0:26:18| And also, I've taught science in two different universities, including the University of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| I have brought some visual aids, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1583)|

| 0:26:52| I want to point out one aspect, that as of elementary school health standards, this may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1612)|
| 0:26:59| surprise many, but as of fourth grade in health standards, one of the main strands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1619)|

| 0:27:08| And as of fourth grade, students are asked to identify prevention strategies for not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1628)|

| 0:27:14| For example, vaccines, staying home with fever, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| So we expect fourth graders across the state of Tennessee and in Knox County schools to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| discuss how to keep everybody safe from pathogens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Why can't you institute policies that do the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Also, in terms of science standards, we have what are called the scientific and engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1653)|

| 0:27:39| And these are the practices and behaviors that we expect students to engage in as they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| learn about science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| I'm going to call attention to two, first being analyzing and interpreting data, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1665)|

| 0:27:53| So let me give you an example of what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| What I've spent a career doing with my students, here's a graph made from data from the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1678)|

| 0:28:20| But one of the questions that I would ask my students typically would be something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| what patterns do you see in the data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1704)|

| 0:28:32| And they can come to conclusions that are consistent with scientific consensus in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| of saying, well, these two lines diverge from each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1717)|

| 0:28:43| It's the line that says school age kids in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| What's the key event there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Kids in Knox County schools are smart enough to put that together too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| The key event is the first day of school, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| As of the time we put kids back in school on August 9th, cases started skyrocketing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| because we were putting them back in and it's in a situation where no safety requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| were in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=1750)|

| 0:40:31| and help teach my children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| The thing that that could not make up for was the experience of going to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| It was a very hard decision for me to make to send my children to school this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| They blossomed within the first few days of being at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| It was remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| I am Cecily Fishman, a mother of two children who are currently battling brain cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2449)|

| 0:41:11| And they too cannot protect them without this choice of pulling their children from school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| At this point, it is my children's right to an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2476)|

| 0:41:31| I tell you this because the hardships of not having a masking policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| of not having contact tracing, means that after week one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| we found out through a friend that their child was exposed and had coronavirus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| and I had to put my children and pull them from school, quarantine them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2504)|

| 0:43:01| I'm here to tell you first and foremost that COVID is a treatable, outpatient condition for almost all patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| The reason so many people here in East Tennessee end up hospitalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| is the failure of our healthcare community as a whole to treat COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| We are denying our community outpatient protocols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| The outpatient protocols that I follow are from a critical care alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| I'll tell you some of the expertise of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2607)|
| 0:43:32| One is the MD, Chief Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| Eastern Virginia Medical School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2616)|

| 0:43:54| These are not what some people want to call quacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| These are the cream of the crop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| And they're telling you and I'm telling you, COVID is largely a treatable condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| In this community, COVID is no more dangerous for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| and in fact is less dangerous based on the current statistics than RSV or influenza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| RSV is normally a wintertime thing but for some reason it hit this summer and it hit hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| We've had way more children hospitalized for RSV than we have COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Yet in the history of our school system, no one has ever made this kind of a deal over RSV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| Influenza is more dangerous for children than COVID but you've never seen these people carry on like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| People that were standing out on the street protesting for masks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| I watched pull down their masks to move in close to talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| This is not about severe real concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I do want to tell you all about a bona fide medical condition called mesophobia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| It's a pathological condition and it's a fear of germs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| People with this condition may feel compelled to engage in excessive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| and ritualistic compulsions against contamination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| Unfortunately for these very tortured people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| living life means sometimes encountering dirt, illness or even pathogens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| But for these people, this fear of coming into contact with any of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| significantly interferes with their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| People with mesophobia struggle to evaluate which situations are dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| and they feel worried or panicked when encountering daily scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| which will always involve germs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| They will take extensive measures to avoid contamination or decontaminate themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| in the spaces they inhabit and they try to reflect those pathological fears on other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| It is vitally important when encountering people that have this medical condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| that we extend love and patience while not engaging in this pathological behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| Thank you to the five of you who have been loving, logical and refused to engage in this behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2750)|

| 0:46:26| We need mask mandates in schools to not help ourselves but to help others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| Masks have proven to be effective at reducing the spread of COVID-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| We need space seating to help reduce the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| We need to contact trace so that way parents know and can be notified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| that their child was potentially exposed so they know to get tested and to quarantine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| which will help reduce the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| I chose to send my kids back to school this year in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| because of a policy passed by our school board in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| that said that the school board would follow CDC guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| That policy has not been rescinded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| I wanted my children to have some normalcy and some stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| Even though they are wearing masks, they want to see their friends and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| My children think masks can be bothersome from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| but they know masks help protect others and they say it's another way they can also use to express themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2841)|
| 0:47:27| And they wish that more students would wear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| My children have seen their fair share of tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| They have lost their father, their granny, their great-grandma, their great-pop-pop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| And upon recently learning I have a compromised immune system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| and I don't know how I would react to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| Do you really want to put my children through another tragedy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| Not to mention all of our students and staff and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| that have compromised immune systems that we could lose to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2872)|

| 0:48:04| Especially with the Delta variant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2884)|

| 0:48:40| Because COVID has a long incubation period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2920)|

| 0:49:23| Mask, contact tracing, and space eating will help reduce the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| I feel hopeless and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Thank you, I'm going to have to stop you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Please follow what you guys promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2970)|
| 0:49:31| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| Dr. Overholt, April Tipton, Helena Rago, Alastair Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| Thank you, if you'll please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| Virginia Overholt, Knox County, and thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| I'm here to present to the board an alternative technology and treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2988)|
| 0:49:55| to help you eliminate COVID from our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| The technology is based on hypochlorous acid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3001)|
| 0:50:05| which is a product that's already in our white blood cells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| It's what our white blood cells use to fight bacteria and viruses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| and kill them when they enter into the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| We have found a way to make that product stronger and better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3018)|
| 0:50:24| and to aerosolize it in a room through a humidifier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| We have found with scientific studies and data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| that the aerosolization of hypochlorous will eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| COVID-like viruses and other viruses, including flu, from the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| and it will do it safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| Safety is a huge issue here because people are going to be breathing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| We have acute studies that show no toxicity to lung or to other tissues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3054)|
| 0:51:02| We have chronic scientific studies that show absolutely no injury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| to human cells that have been cultured outside the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| and exposed to chronic exposure of hypochlorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3072)|
| 0:51:16| Totally safe, safe as air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| What we would like to propose in this short time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3079)|
| 0:51:25| is that we work with Knox County schools to outfit them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| with this system of hypochlorous aerosolization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| to help safely and effectively remove COVID virus from the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3094)|
| 0:51:41| and from your system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| We can do it safely, protect your schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| protect your teachers, protect your students, and do it safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| The technology is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| The decision is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| April Tipton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3119)|
| 0:52:12| Is April Tipton here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Helena Rago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| And after that, we'll have Alastair Elliott and then Murray Clemson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3141)|
| 0:52:31| Hi. Just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| You'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| My name is Helena Rago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| I'm going to move this back because it's really loud out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| My name is Helena Rago and I'm a resident of the 4th District of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| First, I want to acknowledge our amazing representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| We know that you're under tremendous pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| and we are here to thank you for supporting our rights as parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| and our children's medical freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| We, the evident majority, ask you for your continued support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| in keeping the policies the way that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| The board does not have the authority to institute a mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| yet here we are again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| Last time we were told it was because of Delta| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| and with references to the American Association of Pediatrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| and Overrun Children's Hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Just last week, the vice president of the AAP stated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| that there's no evidence that the Delta variant is causing more severe disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| And East Tennessee Children's Hospital is now publishing weekly updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| to provide truth and transparency to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| But even with these numbers, it's not exclusively Knox County children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| Our TCAP scores show us the effects of our district policies last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3215)|
| 0:53:39| To some in this room, it might be statistics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| but that is my child that has always excelled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| yet failed to meet the benchmarks last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| I spent 12 years building my children's immune system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| because the CDC explains that the immune system is the body's natural way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| of protecting itself from infection and disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| Taking care of yourself helps your immune system take care of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| And that active immunity is the result of exposure to a disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| that triggers the immune system to produce antibodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| resulting in natural immunity that is lifelong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| or I'm sorry, long-lasting and sometimes lifelong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| It's from the CDC in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I don't support taking your vaccination card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| to now get two free donuts from Krispy Kreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| And I don't think that people who do support that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| should choose to have a say in my children's health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| To our representatives who believe that they do have a choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| in the medical options of my children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| we see you, we see you fundraising maskless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| we see you instigating in Facebook groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| and we see the comments about your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| But every difference in opinion is not a difference in principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| We were told that this district would not tolerate harassment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| yet we have parents screaming at cars outside of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| and threatening violence at school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Our students are still being harassed and pressured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| by teachers and administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| and subjected to backhanded comments daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Children get sick at the beginning of the school year every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| and every year we cancel school during flu season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Less than 1% of children are currently positive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| and only eight children in our region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| are in need of some extra support to recover with antibodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Our children are at virtually zero risk of COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| a far less chance of severe illness and disease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| than RSV and the flu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| Yet we are trying to rely on failed methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| of mitigation and testing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| to prevent natural active immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| We are done listening to those who have gotten it all wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you for your time and dedication to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| Thank you for coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Alistair Elliott, then Murray Clemson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| then Adina Clemson, and then Drew Kinmear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Please state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| I'm Alistair Elliott from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Did you skip over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| I mean, I was following along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Did we skip over one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Somebody wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| Somebody wasn't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Ms. Tipton was not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| No, I didn't hear the name of Helena Rago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| Oh, that's who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| No, I don't want to skip anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3373)|
| 0:56:15| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Alistair Elliott, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| I keep wondering how we've gotten here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| I'm looking on Facebook, seeing these groups with parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| contact tracing themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| I'm seeing them scared, frustrated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| and not because of a thin little mask that their kids have to wear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3391)|
| 0:56:36| It's because these kids are getting sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Everyone keeps saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| oh, it doesn't affect children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3401)|
| 0:56:43| We have 11 kids in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| 900 Friday had COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| That's clearly affecting our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| And I know the defense for kids being in the hospital is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| oh, well, they have pre-existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| And they're still a part of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| They are still children that we should be caring for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| and we should be concerned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| To dismiss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| it blows my mind that there are people dismissing it as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| oh, pre-existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3432)|
| 0:57:14| It's unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| The other thing that I keep hearing about these kids in the hospital is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| we have way more with RSV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| RSV is a respiratory illness, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| It's probably spread the same way as COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| If you're concerned about RSV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I bet masks would help cover that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| Cut down the numbers some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| I think this has been like a real fun little experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| Experiment with our kids' lives and their families' lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| It's not going so well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| 900 kids have COVID in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| Those kids are going home to their families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| to their uncles, their grandparents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| their brothers and sisters that may have pre-existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| This is affecting the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| I know that the other thing is going to be like this executive order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| First of all, it goes against the Tennessee state constitution and our state charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Bill Lee does not have the authority to make policy for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| That's on you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| All that they can do is fund our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| If it was vice versa and he issued a mask mandate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| I bet many of you up here would be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| he doesn't have the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| But now that like he's saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| parents should be able to opt out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| we got to follow this tooth and nail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| All of this is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| You guys need to start following the CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| mask, the cleaning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| do everything that it takes to cut down these cases for our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| and this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| Murray Clemson, and then we'll have Adina Clemson and then Drew Kinmir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| And you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| My name is Murray Clemson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| My wife and I was going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| but she can't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| So I'm going to try to talk about what she want to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Also, I'm from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| and Dogwood Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| I have three kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| Eleven, eight, and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Going to be six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| He was going to be in kindergarten this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| but we just couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| We couldn't put our kids in the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| one more year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| with just the lack of transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| and application of common sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| in Dogwood Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Now, I hear about considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| putting masks back on kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| but I just can't believe how ridiculous this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| If anybody does any research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| outside of CDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| Fauci's favorite, Bill Gates' favorite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| you're going to know that the virus is very, very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| It's like trying to stop a baby with a chain link fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| So I'm really unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| I'd like my kids to go back to Dogwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| Caleb and Sarah, they're top of their class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| Caleb's an ambassador.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| Never got into trouble. Perfect marks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3633)|
| 1:00:36| But, you know, one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| that broke the camel's back is Miss Lana Lowe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| and, you know, Renee Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Excuse me. We don't talk about individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| You're just addressing the board in general, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Okay, well, I just wanted to let you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| that I brought it up that they're giving my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| sexually implicit videos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| sexually implicit music, and I brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| I brought it up to Lana.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| Sorry, I brought it to the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| And this is just something that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3669)|
| 1:01:12| And they don't consider my needing to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| what they're teaching my kids a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| I'm called a extreme conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I do care about what my kids are learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Yeah, so the point I'm trying to make is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| this lack of transparency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3690)|
| 1:01:33| lack of application of common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| When the virus is so small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| there is no way that the mask is going to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Anybody that's really doing some research here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| is going to know this is what the experts are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| Even the N95 mask will not stop the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| So why are we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| On the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| So I hope that people are going to do a little research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| outside the CDC and Bill Gates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| and George Soros-funded organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you. I think you said Adina Clemson is not coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Heather Carroll and then Tina Shields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| and then Emily McBee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Please state your name and county residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| And you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| Good afternoon. Thank you for allowing me to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| My name is Drew Kenber, veteran, father of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| and new resident to Knox County from Indianapolis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| I will tell the students that want their masks back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| the parents that want their students' masks back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| I came from an area that reissued it just now last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| I guarantee it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I first-hand witnessed that last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| I preface this with between the ages of zero and 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| the age range published on 826 by Knox County Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| out of a population of 97,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| there were zero deaths among our young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| So I appreciate and respect all of your positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| but we have literature on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| and there's a lot of literature out there that masks do not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| What bothers me is I don't hear the propaganda machine out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| and I don't hear the government and our leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| informing us of the harm that these masks cause to our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| How about it weakens the immune system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3810)|

| 1:03:42| The mask option must remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| It is 100% parents' decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| Not the government, not the state, and not the school board, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| And stand your ground, school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3831)|

| 1:03:57| The justification for this insidiously states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| that it is in order to determine if allowing mask freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| is a violation of students' right to a free public education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| Listen carefully. They want to investigate our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| to determine whether allowing mask freedom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| is a violation of freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| That's unbelievable, but it doesn't surprise me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3855)|

| 1:04:21| I'm going to continue on real quick to the last study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| on how masks harm our students and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| It should be about the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3867)|
| 1:04:30| There's a doctor by the name of Margaret Risen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3870)|

| 1:04:39| and their effects on our brains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| The re-inhalation of our exhaled air will, without a doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| create oxygen deficiency and flooding of carbon dioxide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| There are acute warning symptoms that are headaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| drowsiness, dizziness, issues in concentration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| and those of you parents that put two masks on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| I know firsthand, when my sons describe these acute warning systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| when you have a chronic oxygen deprivation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| all of those symptoms disappear because you get used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| Your efficiency will remain impaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3906)|
| 1:05:09| and the under-supply of oxygen in your brain continues to progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| While you're thinking that you have gotten used to wearing your mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| and re-breathing your own exhaled toxic air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| the degenerative processes in your brain are getting amplified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3918)|

| 1:05:30| and the damage that has taken place cannot be reversed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3930)|
| 1:05:33| We don't need a clinical study to tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| Our children need oxygen to function, they need oxygen to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| they need oxygen to avoid damage to the brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=3939)|

| 1:10:43| You are. The CDC says we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| that you wear a mask, and I'm pretty positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| that that's exactly what you have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| When you put in a mask mandate, you do not give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| half of the group, or more than a half of the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| a choice. They have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| When you allow it to be parental choice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| the people who want to can wear one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| If you don't think your one mask is effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| then wear two. Wear my kids. I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| Wear 100 masks. If you're really scared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4273)|
| 1:11:16| do what happened last year when the essential workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4276)|

| 1:11:25| bathe them at four. If you have someone in your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4285)|

| 1:11:34| If you put us in masks when we don't want to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| we have no choice. I found out yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| that my son, who's in a special ed classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| his teacher is begging for no masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| I did not realize this, but my son apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| did not speak hardly at all last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| and when he wears it on his head, he'll talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| So he wears it on his head, pulling his ears up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| half the time. It's really funny, not real clean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| and not real effective. But then again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| masks don't work anyway, so what's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| But he's not getting the education that he's guaranteed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| when he can't see his teacher's mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| can't see their expressions, and they can't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| what he's saying because he's either not talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| or he sounds like he has a bag full of marbles in his mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Okay, I'm out of time. I'm going to have to stop you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4342)|

| 1:12:55| I'm a Tennessee volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| I did not need a mandate to wear a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| or stay home or get a vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| I volunteered, and because many others have not made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| those same commitments, the Delta variant is out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| We all have a common goal at the root of this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| We want safe, in-person learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| I'm not here to argue if masks work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4396)|

| 1:13:22| I'm not here to argue with the local school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| about the situation in our public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4405)|

| 1:13:34| We can't control what goes on outside of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| but we can use best practice in the schools to keep our kids safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| If you follow the science when you decide on curricula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4420)|

| 1:22:25| that have been scared of COVID and wanting to mask kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4945)|

| 1:23:16| Indoor masking is still the best tool we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| to slow down to allow us to continue to be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| If you think about in-person schooling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| you will allow the superintendent the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| to institute what he needs to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| to allow us to stay in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| You know, I had said at the other end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| within the next three to four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| and I'm repeating from last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| when the hospitals and the ICUs are full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| but the schools are closed, you will remember tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| and missing the chance to make a different decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| There are about 70 beds left across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5032)|

| 1:24:16| when we have students who can't be covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| by teachers in classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| there's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5062)|

| 1:24:43| you should listen to those who know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| what they're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| Many of the people who are YouTube watchers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| they don't know anything about RNA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| let alone understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5095)|
| 1:24:58| Many of us have invested our lives in this material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| We don't care about control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| Otherwise, we wouldn't be scientists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| I don't know many scientists who are in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| That's politicians, and I appreciate you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| But what we do ask you to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| is listen to those who have been correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| Are the ICUs full of people who are wearing masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| Are the ICUs full of people who have hypoxia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| from wearing masks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5125)|
| 1:25:28| No, otherwise our surgeons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| who've been masked for 70 years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| would be dropping dead left and right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| So what should you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| You were elected and tasked with leading us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5140)|

| 1:26:01| Because you are my people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| Well, I like it? Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5164)|

| 1:26:25| it would be to make improvements to our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| But that was not to be so. So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| I would like to thank Ms. Horn, Ms. Henderson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5191)|

| 1:26:43| for their children, and I appreciate that you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| In regards to the agenda items tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| I would like to share what the children are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| We, as a pastor, invited our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| to come to the altar and pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| As leaders, we walk around and make sure they don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| anything during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| Many of them were repeating the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| They never want to hear the word COVID ever again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| And when will the adults see us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Our children are still waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| For three weeks, things in our school were pretty close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| to normal. Things started to change when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| pandemic hit, and we started to see a decline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| in our reading charts. We then started to hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| teachers throughout the district that principals were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| pressuring their teachers to wear masks again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| strictly enforcing the three-foot rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5254)|
| 1:27:37| In that same time, we heard from parents of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5257)|
| 1:27:40| that were coming home in tears, asking what they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| done wrong, that their teachers were now wearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| masks and yelling at them all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Also, teachers that do not want to wear masks that fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| the virus, and adults screaming about all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| want to saddle the lowest risk of severe illness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| or spreading the virus with the strictest restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| when all they want to do is just be children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| They also say it's only for a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Two years to us is nothing, but two years to a six-year-old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| is almost half of their lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| While many other countries are confused by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| we're treating our children, as young as two, here we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| vaccines are readily available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| We cannot allow the fear of the adults to crush our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5305)|

| 1:29:34| so now is the time to act and put into practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| the CDC guidelines to keep our schools safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| We need speedy contact tracing, we need social distancing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5380)|

| 1:30:07| they should be required to have their child tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5407)|

| 1:31:48| Can they send them to school? Under what conditions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| And I've been following this group pretty closely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5511)|
| 1:31:54| and what I can tell you, kind of on behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| what I'm sensing is just there's a lot of confusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| there's a lot of frustration, and there's a lot of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| I personally have no way to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| if my kids have been exposed to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| I know the health department is doing contact tracing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| but the system is overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| We need to get our kids back to the school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| so that it can be fast, so it can be efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| because we deserve to know whether we are at risk or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| Which leads to another point, which is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| I'm hearing a lot that kids are going to be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| I know the statistics are in our favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| I'm pretty sure my kids would be okay if they got COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| I don't know that for sure, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| Parents might not be okay, aunts, uncles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| grandparents might not be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| Grandchildren now will not be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Somebody I know recently, an acquaintance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| who's part of an organization I'm involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| just found out the father is currently in the ICU on event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| That child may not have known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| how or under what circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| they were exposed to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| So I think that at minimum, we need to tonight talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| how to inform parents, how to be transparent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| and how to let us know so that we can make good choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5592)|
| 1:33:15| for our kids' health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| Beyond that, I'm just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| the situation has changed dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| I think we can look at last year with mitigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| we can look at this year with no mitigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| and see the absolute clear difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| I think that's very hard to argue against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| The numbers have gone up dramatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| since school has started, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| it's absolutely undeniable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| that COVID is spreading quickly in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| And I'm hearing a couple voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| I'm hearing a voice that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| well, I'm not hearing it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| Collectively, hearing a voice that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| let this spread through the schools, kids will be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| There's another voice, though, that thinks collectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| and says, we, you, have an obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| to protect everybody in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| and that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| And if you'll just say your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| My name is Sabrina Slade, and I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| And I'm also a citizen of the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| And this question that we're asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| mask or no mask, it's not that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| It's going to be the detrimental answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| History repeats itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| I know you've heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| Who's right and who's wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| It's our choice of freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5685)|

| 1:34:54| If you want to wear a mask and cover your face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| go to Afghanistan, where they want our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| They want their girls to go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| What's coming down next is the vaccination mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| The Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5706)|

| 1:35:15| and the CDC director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| they stand firm on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| and this is a quote from the Washington Times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5721)|

| 1:35:27| is becoming a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| of the unvaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| They're already selling the mask people out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| because it's not even about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| Behind the scenes here, there's already a coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| and they're called the compassion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| the compassion of fatigue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| And you know what they say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| The vaccinated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| the vaccinated must now reckon with the feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| like they've already done everything they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| and everything they are supposed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| to quell this pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| while seeing others squash their hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| and sacrifice by refusing the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| I pledge allegiance to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5772)|

| 1:36:30| Vaccine, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| Females, no school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5793)|

| 1:36:51| this has to be looked through a different lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5811)|
| 1:36:54| with eyes wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5814)|
| 1:36:57| We have become so narrow-minded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| that we have forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| the very blood of the people in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5823)|

| 1:37:15| Everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Once that is chipped away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| where do we start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Because let me tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5844)|

| 1:37:36| If you'll just state your name, county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| and you'll have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| This is my first time speaking and I do have valid points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5862)|

| 1:37:54| Okay, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5874)|

| 1:38:06| for the families represented here by saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5886)|

| 1:38:21| but we must not lose sight of our individual rights and freedoms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| that all parents and citizens have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| We have to choose to set our feelings and emotions aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| in order to approach this problem rationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| and not forget to love and respect each other's differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5913)|

| 1:38:42| pursuant to the executive order number 84 by a governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| I let the director know that my son would not be masked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| Since that day I've been threatened to lose privileges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| utilizing their services. I've actually received an disciplinary action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| in the form of a write-up and hand-delivered to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| in the school's office for refusal to mask my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| It's completely absurd that children go to school without a mask all day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| and a very small group of people are able to implement policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| without any oversight, that children must don a mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| before they're able to go back to the cafeteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| if they're in a position of authority to intervene and won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Everyone that is aware of this should be embarrassed to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| a very small and private entity to have a bigger voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| and more power than all of you, and you should be ashamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| to call yourselves a leader. If this is the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| you're hearing this, I hope that you're infuriated as I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| at the impact of families you're elected to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| I had no problem looking into this myself in a quick search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| There actually is some recourse that you guys could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| To those taking the position of my hands were tied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| this aftercare program cares more about their health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| and safety than the parents, the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| the principals, and their teachers. However, I'm no fool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| nor I stand in silence or be coerced by this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| or contracted service providers, now or in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| to comply with requirements or mandates infringing on my rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| as a parent. Using this virus to justify abuse of power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| overreach, and invasion of privacy ends right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Hiding behind it's a private entity is a cop-out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| and I will never accept that. Otherwise, when does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| There's an interesting piece of information available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| that's available on the website, all to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Taking the reported number of cases in the 0-17 age demographic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| 9,036, and dividing it into the reported population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| of 97,080 students in that same demographic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| only 9.3% of this group would contract the virus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| Knox County's been tracking the numbers for 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| so the rate in which the children under your purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| are contracting the virus is only 2% of new cases each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| If you extrapolate that out, we'll be having this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| Be smart. The data's available. It's time to start making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| logical decisions with the information available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| and stop pretending it doesn't exist. What doesn't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| is the mortality rate amongst our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| It's literally killed nobody. No kids. Praise God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| Massport wants a solution on the table, and now they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| They simply don't work. There are other solutions to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Be the board that be an example. Be a board that be an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6069)|

| 1:41:21| and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| Meredith Hayes, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| I've been to many school board meetings. I know many of you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| on a personal level throughout my years in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| I'm usually known as the silent prayer warrior that's over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| in the room praying for every single person in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6096)|
| 1:41:39| for the things that are going to take place, the kids' lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| that are going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| But I decided that I have specifically been praying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| Psalm 46 for you guys, Ephesians 6-12, and 1 Peter 5-7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| if you would like to know what I've been praying over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6111)|

| 1:42:00| I've held about every position you can hold on a PTA board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| between secretary, school carnival chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| I'm a nurse. I've been a nurse for 22 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| 18 of those years in pediatrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| I've been a county teacher for 41 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I say all this to say that I am passionate about children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| I'm passionate about the care of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| and I'm passionate about every single child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| just not one over here or one over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| As we go forward, I just would like to ask you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| to continue on the path that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| Historically, every single thing we do in education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| you have to have parents' permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Go on a field trip, sign a permission slip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Come home with your kid at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| We allow parents a choice. We allow them to choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| what is best for their child throughout all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| Historically, parents have been able to make that choice for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| I'm not going to quote statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| I'm not going to quote studies, because there are studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| on this side of things. There are studies on this other side of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| You guys know, because I know you look at the dashboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| I know you know what's going on in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| I know you've surveyed what's going on in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| I don't want to talk about wearing a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| not wearing a mask, getting a shot, not getting a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| That's not what this is about. Everyone needs to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| to make the choice that is best for them and for their child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| within the health system. I do have three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| My youngest is the only one that is still left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| in the school system, so I've been here a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| and I'm not going anywhere. I will always fight for kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| I'm still teaching. I work with youth at my church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| and I've been involved, as I said, in some form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| with children's lives via health care or the outside world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| for the greater part of 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| So my platform tonight, I didn't really have anything prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| I just wanted to ask you guys, I wanted to first of all thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| I know that when you guys took this board position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| you didn't really know what you were in for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| and to be honest, you might not have if you'd known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| what this last year and a half was going to be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| so I thank you for your service, and I would really like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| us get back to a place of just loving people again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| I know that in the community that we have had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| it absolutely breaks my heart, so how do we come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| to really focus on our kids again and not discuss this again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| at a meeting? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6261)|

| 1:44:45| I know that a lot of people are a little nervous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| about students making the decision to mask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| or not mask their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6291)|

| 1:45:00| Teachers do not need to spend the school year this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| being mask monitors. They need to teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| Our children are lagging behind in their education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6306)|

| 1:52:39| So, is John Meal here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6759)|
| 1:52:49| And the last name is M-E-L-E, so I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| If you're here and just not hearing your name, please walk in and let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| Chrissy Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| Please state your name, county of residence, and you'll get three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| My name is Chrissy Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| I'm a Christ follower, a wife, a mother of three, and a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6789)|
| 1:53:16| As I was preparing for tonight, it occurred to me that you've probably already heard it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| And you've already heard so many impassioned speeches, I'll keep this short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| I'm simply going to thank the board members that respect medical freedom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| and that took a stand to support the rights of parents to choose for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| how to best care for the health of their own children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| My children will never be masked, we do not consent to contact tracing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| and my husband and I do not co-parent with any governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| John Meal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| Yes, my name is John Meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| I have a granddaughter in 11th grade at West High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| and I'm mostly here to speak for her because I've been raising her since she was five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| And, you know, I've heard a lot of talk here, 50-50, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| between masked or unmasked, and I'm not here to give a scientific evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| because you've heard a million, but, you know, we have these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| and we want to believe they're safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| I wish I could tell you they were, I can't tell you they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| It's just the science isn't really good on either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| and you can hold this up and it's basically a mask without strings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| And, you know, you put this over your face, and it changes you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6870)|
| 1:54:36| The minute you put this over your face, you don't talk properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| you don't communicate properly, and you don't even act properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| After a while, your hands aren't moving, I'm Italian descent, so they're always moving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| but you stop that, and you start talking like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| and you talk less, and you talk little, and you do not communicate correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| And that is what's happening in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| First, you had an idea that we'd keep everybody home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| We tried it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| Everybody's tried the mask, everybody's tried everything in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| The science is out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| There is no science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| They're still figuring this thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6913)|
| 1:55:15| All over the world, we've tried everything, every protocol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| and this thing is still spreading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6918)|
| 1:55:20| The children are being brought up in an element of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| Total fear is all they hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| I've raised my granddaughter now, and I can't believe what her generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| is going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| It makes me so upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| No child should have to be brought up in fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| You're supposed to bring your children up to face the world as much as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| And in school, they need to have communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6937)|
| 1:55:40| They need to have a visual connection with their teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| so that they can talk, they can hear, and they can communicate properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| It's how we all communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| Yes, some people are going to get sick from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| and some people are going to die,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| but that's what any sickness is, any pandemic is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| The mask has become nothing but a mask of tyranny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| And tyranny starts in small steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6961)|
| 1:56:04| That is something I learned a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| It starts with a very small step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| And the first step, in this case, is a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| when we know it doesn't work, when we know it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| If people think that it does work, that's their prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| If you do have a good idea, it does not require a mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| It requires agreement. It does not require force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| When we all thought it was a good idea to wear a mask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| I told my granddaughter, wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| When I learned it didn't, I said, take it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| It smelled when she brought it home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| You think these kids are keeping it in their pocket and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| Let's be real about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7002)|
| 1:56:44| You are a school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| You are not a medical authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| In medical, your decision is how best to educate these children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| You need to keep these schools open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7012)|
| 1:56:54| The depression that these kids are suffering through is unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7014)|
| 1:56:57| I know you wish to stop me, but I will keep speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| That's why this hat is on, and I will speak until I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| Sir, I'm going to have to stop you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| I don't care. I have a couple of words to say, and I will finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7025)|
| 1:57:07| We are going to have to stop you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7027)|
| 1:57:09| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Sir, please stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7031)|
| 1:57:13| A mask, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| Rebecca Reeves, then Sherry Garrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| and then Jordan Kimmitt, and then Christy Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7039)|
| 1:57:23| Rebecca Reeves not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| Okay, Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| Please state your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| I'm not going to take up much of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| You've heard all the statistics, all of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| The simple fact is there is no authority here to require masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| I'm not going to take up much of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| You've heard all the statistics, all of the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7069)|
| 1:57:51| There is no authority here to require masking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7071)|
| 1:57:54| It has already been determined by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| This country was founded on individual rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| As a constitutional republic, not a democracy, as some may claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| Each parent has the right to determine what is right for their child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7084)|
| 1:58:08| Let's try this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7088)|
| 1:58:10| Let's make a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| that no one is allowed to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| No children, no teachers, no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| That would be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| That would take away the parental choice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| of those who choose to put their children in masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| But apparently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| some of the members of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7106)|
| 1:58:28| think it's okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| to take away the rights of parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| who would choose not to mask their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| That's not okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| In this country, you do not take away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| the rights of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| to protect the rights of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| And on this last note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| I wanted to make one little comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| When you're looking at epidemiologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| and specific experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| look at where they're getting their paychecks from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| Follow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Jordan Kimmitt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| and then Christy Carter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7140)|
| 1:59:02| and then Jennifer Mendoza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-210902?start=7142)|
