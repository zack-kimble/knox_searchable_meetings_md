| 0:00:00| Okay, welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| We're just about ready to start our second public hearing on our billboard ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=8)|
| 0:00:15| and regulation of EMCs and digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=15)|
| 0:00:21| Before we do that, since we had a snag with the insolvency board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=21)|
| 0:00:25| if for some reason one of our members who is a committee member of the insolvency board comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=25)|
| 0:00:33| we will stop this meeting at that time and allow you to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=33)|
| 0:00:39| I think it will take five minutes, just very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=39)|
| 0:00:43| And so if it looks like we've got a quorum, we'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=43)|
| 0:00:47| If there's no objection from any of the commissioners, if that's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=47)|
| 0:00:52| we're having trouble getting that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=52)|
| 0:00:54| And if that does not take place, we will make sure that the next time we will notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=54)|
| 0:01:02| and have confirmations of attendance before we try to get a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=62)|
| 0:01:08| And I'm sorry that we didn't do that and that you're here stuck with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| Okay, we'll go ahead and start our public forum for our hearing on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=74)|
| 0:01:24| Would any of the commissioners like to say anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| or do we have anybody that would like to do a synopsis of our previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Okay, without that, we'll go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| And I'll go in order of the people who have signed up that I have on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| First, I have Marcia Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| And if you would, and we'll hold to the five-minute rule pretty much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| unless you feel like you've really got something that you can't get in in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=114)|
| 0:02:03| And so if you would, when you come, come say your name and your address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=123)|
| 0:02:08| and then we'll start the clock at five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Marcia Greve and Ms. Greve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| Okay, we'll go to the next one, Terry Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=136)|
| 0:02:24| Hello, Ms. Faulkner, and thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=144)|
| 0:02:28| It's a pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| And thank you, commissioners, for having a second meeting on this because I was unable to attend the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| Do I need to give my address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| I'm Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| And I'm president of the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| And I'm here representing members of our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| and I thought I would tell you just a little bit about it because I'm not sure that we've ever represented ourselves here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=174)|
| 0:03:01| But our council was formed in 2001 and is composed of representatives from five neighborhoods in the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=181)|
| 0:03:11| It's approximately 2,500 households, including Westwood, Forest Heights, Kingston, Pike, Sequoia Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| Historic Sutherland Heights, and Lines View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=199)|
| 0:03:23| Many local business owners and developers attend our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=203)|
| 0:03:27| And working together in the past 11 years, we have sought to create an environmentally sustainable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| aesthetically pleasing pedestrian Bearden village based on an MPC small area plan that city council passed in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=213)|
| 0:03:45| In working with businesses and developers on the front end of local infill projects in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| particularly on our two arterials, Sutherland Avenue and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| we have focused with the business people and the infill folks on the addition of sidewalks, landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=237)|
| 0:04:05| and particularly smaller attractive signage, especially monument-style signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=245)|
| 0:04:15| The success of our efforts with developers and business people has paid off for everyone concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=255)|
| 0:04:22| Economically for the businesses and sustained in rising home values and in our quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| We believe the urban environment created here has attracted many new businesses even during the worst times of the recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=271)|
| 0:04:40| Almost all of our infill sites along these arterials are filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| And our strip mall parking lots are full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| And our traffic is getting really bad because people enjoy being in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| And a big part of it is the pleasant urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| It's for these reasons that the Bearden Council members strongly support better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=303)|
| 0:05:09| more stringent regulations on signage in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Thank you, Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| And sometimes the commissioners will have a question or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| so I'll look for lights on that, but I don't think they do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| Next, Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| It's great to be here, and I appreciate this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| My name is Mary English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| The address is 810 Oak Grove Lane, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| I'm on the board of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| It's got 180 members, and I'm speaking on behalf of the League and its president, Jamie Dobbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=351)|
| 0:05:59| I appeared before you at the October 8th public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| and I really do appreciate the opportunity to briefly add to the comments I made then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| So as I noted at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| the League enthusiastically supports the proposals that are before the county commission regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| prohibiting new billboards as well as conversion of existing billboards to digital models,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| and also to prohibit new electronic messaging centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=388)|
| 0:06:36| The League, as I noted then, supports policies and strategies that enhance community appearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| and livability by, among other things, eliminating billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=402)|
| 0:06:47| And as I mentioned back then, we're particularly concerned about off-premise billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=407)|
| 0:06:55| because they adversely affect the economy and the well-being of our local community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=415)|
| 0:07:01| by degrading the county's appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| So I want to expand on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Billboards, as we know, are intended to capture the attention of people driving around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=427)|
| 0:07:14| and through the community, especially on interstates and on major highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| Obviously, that's why they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| It's virtually impossible to avoid noticing a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| They have a captive audience, and they contribute to people's impressions of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| Our county's attractiveness as a place to live and a place to do business is based, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| on its distinctiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| Billboards do not contribute to the county's distinctiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=464)|
| 0:07:49| They detract from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| The view from the road in Knox County is that our county is no different from any other county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| And we ask, is this what we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| Surely we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| In addition, as I mentioned on October 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| we're concerned about billboards' capability, particularly dynamic versions of billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| as well as EMCs of distracting drivers and therefore making driving more dangerous around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| In closing, we understand that there is a possibility that the county will consider a swap option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=502)|
| 0:08:32| which would allow new billboards in exchange for taking down multiple billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| And I want to make clear that the league has not yet adopted a stance on this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| We do, though, look forward to hearing a specific proposal in that regard if one comes to the fore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| We will evaluate it in keeping with our formally adopted positions concerning land use in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=532)|
| 0:09:00| So thank you very much for this opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| and we really appreciate the serious attention that you're bringing to this important matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Thank you, Ms. English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Next, Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=553)|
| 0:09:22| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm pleased to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| I hope that my comments are informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=566)|
| 0:09:32| I'm going to take a little different approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=572)|
| 0:09:37| I've been involved, I guess, in this discussion, shall we say, since the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=577)|
| 0:09:46| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| I guess I should indicate I'm a resident of Knox County for some 45 years, 3621 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=587)|
| 0:09:56| Back in the 1980s, then Governor Lamar Alexander had as part of his platform a program called the Cleaner Highways Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=596)|
| 0:10:12| And Scenic Tennessee in its earlier form, Coalition for Scenic Tennessee, supported Governor Alexander's program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=612)|
| 0:10:25| It did not end up getting passed, but it gained, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| a lot of support for more effective regulation of outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| One of the byproducts of that effort was the development of the logo signs along the highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| which would reduce dependence on the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=645)|
| 0:10:54| I would be the first to acknowledge that advertising is beneficial, but add quickly that we need to strike a balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=654)|
| 0:11:03| If we agree, as I believe it is reasonable for us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| sufficient opportunities are now provided for that kind of advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| And I think there are three distinct benefits in terms of the audiences for whom these benefits accrue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=676)|
| 0:11:29| First, to the citizens of the county, that we're not going to allow excessive signage clutter our highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=689)|
| 0:11:38| and our beautiful community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| Second, we can give the sign industry some specific parameters within which they can effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| and profitably operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| And number three, we can tell the businesses that use billboards that there is a reasonable limit to the number of signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=713)|
| 0:12:04| that can be placed along the roadsides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| and that they don't have to wait and see their advertising dollar diminish in value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=727)|
| 0:12:15| because of the proliferation of billboards on the road system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=735)|
| 0:12:23| We feel that the conversion of existing billboards to digital has recently been clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=743)|
| 0:12:37| in the situation of the billboard as popularly referred to as Corky's billboard right on the edge of Brentwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=757)|
| 0:12:48| and Metro Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| The October 15th decision by the Metro Nashville Chancellery Court in favor of Metro Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=771)|
| 0:12:58| and Brentwood regarding the billboard, which was converted illegally to the digital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=778)|
| 0:13:05| with authorization of their BZA, Building and Zoning Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| Chancellor Bonneman in that case ruled that, quote, there is nothing in the state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| that gives companies the automatic right to digitize existing billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=798)|
| 0:13:25| Murfreesboro recently cut the power supply to a billboard illegally converted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| and operated in defiance of the city sign ordinance for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| I think the argument against proliferating and adding to the EMCs is a reasonable one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=818)|
| 0:13:47| in the interest of public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| And you've all heard the arguments that public safety is endangered, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=829)|
| 0:13:58| by these brightly illuminated signs and to protect the character of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| The industry, and I'm sure that the local companies that affiliate with these large billboard industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=844)|
| 0:14:16| or billboard companies are the exception to this rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| But across the country, what we've found is the sign industry is aggressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| and often disregards the desires of communities to protect their scenic qualities and character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=867)|
| 0:14:36| The industry has consistently challenged the legal standing of local sign ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=876)|
| 0:14:42| often catching the smaller communities unaware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| and the cities yield to rather than fight to avoid the prospect of litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| which I think is tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| But we have many case studies of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Unfortunately, also, the industry has chosen to actually poison trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| and to illegally cut, that is without permit, trees and planting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| often planting that was erected with public funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=914)|
| 0:15:20| that they feel block the view of their billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| When I was working in Memphis several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| there was an outfit led by Mr. Tanner that was heavily fined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| for poisoning several trees in one particular site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| The Tennessee Appeals Court decision on the issue of billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=943)|
| 0:15:53| the resulting decision was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| it is true that wild vegetation as well as that planted by the state has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| and will have a normal tendency to grow taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| Plaintiffs seem to insist that the licensing of a billboard confers some special right of visibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| or imposes some special duty upon the state to maintain visibility of the licensed billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| No authority has been cited or found to sustain this novel theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| Mr. Burry, you've gone a little bit beyond the five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| I mean, we're not we've got about ten other people that have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| I appreciate your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| That concluded my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| You're welcome to make a summary if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=997)|
| 0:16:39| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| I think I've said what needs to be said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| and I'm certainly available to any of the commissioners to answer questions either now or at some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1003)|
| 0:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| There are some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| So just hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| A simple question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| You cited a couple of occurrences of illegally conversion of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| I picked up on one being Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| What was the other city name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| Well, the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Nashville Brentwood was one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| It was one in Nashville and Murfreesboro also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Thank you, Mr. Burry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Mr. Chair, if we could, I'd like to get back and talk about the insolvency real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| because I do not want to hold the staff up that's here representing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| If we could, Chad, you're going to speak to us at luncheon on Monday at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| How about if we met at 1115 on that day, convene for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| That was actually what I suggested to Rebecca,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| and that is that in the absence of a quorum today, if we could schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I think notice went out for that luncheon for next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| We could schedule that, you know, 15, 20 minutes ahead of time in order to take care of this matter for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| And then that would carry straight over into the full more expanded presentation to all of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| Commissioner Wright, do you know, will you be free on that Monday at 1115?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Will you be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| November the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| That's our work session day, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| No, it's the first Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| First Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| I do not know of a reason why I should not be here, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| There's two of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| So, Joe Lee, could you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| I need to check with the staff and see if the car is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| If you'll just check with the other two commissioners, Joe Lee, and if they cannot, would you let us and let Chad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| because, you know, that makes the fourth time that we've tried to meet with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| And Commissioner Smith and Joe Lee, if you don't mind, with respect to the luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| if you could also ask for confirmation on that so that we would know how many commissioners do plan to be at the luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| so we would have at least confirmation both for the committee meeting and for the lunch presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| And that would assist, I know, community development as well as myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| Yeah, he's having prime rib too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| The menu will be up to community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| But, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| You've heard the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Dave, if you can make that and if Amy or Sam could be here, then we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1154)|
| 0:19:19| But we appreciate you all coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| We don't want to hold you up and we'll get back to the billboard issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Thank you, Commission, for your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Thank you, Mr. Tindall and Ms. Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Thank you, Commissioner Garrett, for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| And we will get a confirmation on both the luncheon and the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Next is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| Don't sit down, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| My address is 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1195)|
| 0:20:02| And thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| And I want to thank all the other commissioners who turned out tonight to listen to these presentations on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I also want to let you know that I'm sure you'll be glad to hear that my remarks tonight will be fairly brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| First, we urge you to include restrictions on the operating care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| I'm sorry, I'm representing Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| I'm president of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| We urge you to include restrictions on the operating characteristics of EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| and digital billboards along with the ban on new ones that are the bans that are being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| in the three resolutions before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| In Knoxville, to date, we've only been subjected to a small sample of the capabilities of digital signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| So far, images on the county's digital billboards have remained static for eight seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| But in reality, these signs are capable of much, much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| Digital billboards are capable of being everything from a TV screen or a movie screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1262)|
| 0:21:10| They can do anything that a TV screen or a movie screen can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| We already have EMCs that flash and scroll, but if you've seen a jumbotron at a sporting event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| which I'm sure you all have, or if you've ever been to Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| then you know what else they're capable of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| They're already gearish and intrusive and distracting to drivers and pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| and these capabilities make them even more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| It makes them extremely unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| So these restrictions that have already been written into the City of Knoxville Ordinance are very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1301)|
| 0:21:49| and we ask you to include a hold for 60 seconds before the image can change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1309)|
| 0:21:55| a ban, a prohibition on scrolling, flashing, fading, a prohibition on animation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1315)|
| 0:22:02| and also controls on the brightness levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1322)|
| 0:22:07| We also want to remind you of the importance of passing these resolutions now at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| Almost 1,000 cities have banned billboards in this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| and we're not even talking about foreign cities, which many have done the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| This is in addition to four states that have banned them altogether, which are Vermont, Maine, Alaska,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| and Hawaii, and the state of Arizona has banned all digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| The outdoor advertising industry, as you know, has repeatedly challenged these bans in court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| and has repeatedly lost recently right here in the state of Knoxville, as Mr. Burr pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1361)|
| 0:22:48| in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Finally, recognizing that the legality of these bans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1372)|
| 0:22:57| they are now trying to circumvent them by asking state legislatures to pass laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| which take away the control that local governments now have to enact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| It's only a matter of time before this is introduced in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| Already a watered-down version related to on-premise signs was introduced in the legislature last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| and tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| I'm sure it will reappear this year and probably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| If local control is taken away, the county will have missed its opportunity to control the aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| and safety of its community because it will be illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| We can't afford any longer to delay making these important decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| and I hope that you will support these resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1428)|

| 0:24:25| Good evening, Commissioners, and I'm Jim DeRaup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| I live at 4126 Maloney Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| As others here have already said, I want to thank you for taking the time to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| what I feel is one of the most important issues facing the county commission at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| I'd like to address, first of all, that two of the associations that I am a member of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1488)|
| 0:24:58| first the Lakemore Garden Club has a resolution that was sent to Commissioner Brown requesting the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1498)|
| 0:25:08| of the bans that have been put forth with regards to billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1508)|
| 0:25:15| and digital billboards and EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| Also, the Lake Hills Homeowners Association Beautification Committee has also requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1519)|
| 0:25:28| through the board of that association, that we support these bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1528)|
| 0:25:38| I'd like to talk to you for just a moment about economics because I think if there's a sticking point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1538)|
| 0:25:47| you realize that the outdoor advertising industry does provide some jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| But in a more broader aspect, this county competes with the other counties for residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| And I think the point of retirees as a growth element for the economics of Knox County is important to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1562)|
| 0:26:17| When a person that's retired, in many cases, is flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| I talk to real estate people in North Carolina mountain area, our mountain areas, and they talk about halfbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1583)|
| 0:26:37| These were the guys that went 20 years ago down to Florida and got so sick of it they came halfway back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| And now they want to live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| They want to live in North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| Well, I think they want to live in Tennessee, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| But they have disposable income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| They're not a drain on our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| They bring their money with them and their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| And I think it's so important for us to provide an environment where they say, gee, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| I really like Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| You know, they've got a ban on billboards and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| They're into aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1630)|
| 0:27:12| And rather than having them live down in Teleco Village where they can't do much but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| sit and look at the fact that they don't have any billboards down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Years ago when I was working, I was with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| I wrote the development standards for Teleco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| And that was one of the key ingredients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| And you can go down there and drive the park where you won't see a billboard down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| But they have plenty of residents down there, plenty of folks spending money in Loudoun County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| We need our share here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I would ask that the commissioners consider this factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Also, in closing, I know you've heard from me before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| I just feel very strongly about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| But people talk about flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Maybe we could work with this, that, and the other and water down the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| I don't think so, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I'll tell you what my thought is in management by KISS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| You know, keep it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| And once you start talking about this flexibility and that flexibility and do we change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1693)|
| 0:28:22| how much light do we need in an EMC and can we vary this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| And all of this gets written into some long-winded law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| and we hire five people to try to minister and somebody calls in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| you know, I think that EMC is too bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| It's keeping me awake at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Well, let's get somebody out there and put a meter on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| Well, then the next thing you know you're in a mash on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| Boy, I'll tell you what, I really think these bans are fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| And I think they're in the best interest of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| in the economic growth of this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| and in the fact that we are not going to have to hire five or six people to run around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| and manage them all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| And they're in line with what the city has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| So I encourage the commission to support these bans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Thank you, Mr. Durant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1763)|
| 0:29:35| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Thank you for having us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| I'm Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| I reside at 104 Crawford Road, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| I'm a member of Fountain City Town Hall Board and a member of Scenic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| First, I would like to say that if you fail to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| and read the Citizen's Voice editorial on billboard ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| which appeared in Saturday's New Sentinel written by Joyce Fell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| I would recommend that if you haven't thrown your paper away that you read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| It's quite good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| For many years, signage has been a center of controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| Where can they be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| How tall can they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| How large can they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| How many can there be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| The incorporation of lights and moving parts are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| There are three groups of us, those who want billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| those who would prefer not to have billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| and those who have the responsibility of regulating them, you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| Those who want them are never satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| They want more, want them to be taller, larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| to incorporate the use of lights and moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| This group gains favor with politicians by donating free billboard space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| tout their community duty by giving some free billboard space to nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1861)|
| 0:31:10| overstate claims about their rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| And we all know the real reason that this group won't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| is in billboard regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| It is for their profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| The second group opposes the proliferation of signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| in size, height, number, and the incorporation of lights and moving parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| This group does not appreciate sign clutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| the ugliness of billboards marring our scenic beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| and the negative effect that they have on our city and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| The regulation of signage is a quality-of-life issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1907)|
| 0:31:52| This group agrees with the mission of Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| to preserve and enhance the beauty of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| You are members of the third group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| You will make the decision for changes in the current sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| Remember that regulations help to protect property values of the entire community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| And if voting for or against billboards was on our current ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1936)|
| 0:32:22| I imagine that the against votes would far outnumber the for votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| Ann Harder, a longtime member of Scenic America, Scenic Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| and Scenic Knoxville said in a 2007 letter to MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1953)|
| 0:32:39| as professional planners and appointed commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| you have a unique opportunity to set a higher standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| than either the federal or state governments require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| I hope you will consider this quite thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Brian Conley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| Yes, thanks for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| My name is Brian Conley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| I'm the vice president for Lamar Advertising here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| 3009 West Industrial Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| I'm also a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| I live at 207 Shadowfax Road, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| And I'm here today, I guess, first to rebut some of the things that have been said about our industry as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| And some of them are just really unbelievable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| I thought I was going to get 15 minutes because that's what they've got for a presentation last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| I'll try to make it short in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| No, Mr. Conley, since you're vastly outnumbered today, we'll be glad to grant you some more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| I'll try to make it as quick as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:52| You take your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| You know, the first thing I want to say is, and I sent an e-mail to the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| is, you know, they talk about the four states that don't have billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| Hawaii and Alaska never had traditional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| There's no comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| You know, there's nothing to compare it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Hawaii and Alaska has never had traditional billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Vermont and Maine, you know, there are studies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| I e-mailed them to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| The study shows that since billboards have been banned in Vermont and Maine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| travel and tourism in those states has lagged year after year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| The 50% boost that you see that the opposition hangs their hats on is a boost because of the way they change the collection of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2069)|
| 0:34:39| Everything after that boost, every year, travel and tourism has lagged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Travel and tourism is the cornerstone of the economy in the entire U.S., you know, as well as this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| You know, and I'll talk about travel and tourism a little bit more later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| I just want to get to a few of these points that, you know, the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| I know they brought up issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| If you allow digital billboards, then all those poor guys that go out and hang the sign, they're going to lose their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2099)|
| 0:35:06| Well, that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2106)|
| 0:35:07| These guys are professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2107)|
| 0:35:11| The tenure of my office alone is 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| That's the average tenure of my office, of the employees of my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| These guys have been there from the time they used to paint billboards by hand on through all the way to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| They adapt with the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| That's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2127)|
| 0:35:28| We don't lay people off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| We will still need guys to go out there and work on the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| I mean, you don't just put them up and they run forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| You know, things happen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| You have to go change modules and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| And there's no way that we're going to go out and change every billboard that we have to a digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| I mean, economics would never allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I mean, the things are not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| I mean, it's a ridiculous comment to think that those guys are going to lose their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| You know, then they talked about all, you know, all the things that you see on digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| I know you all got an e-mail of all these terrible things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| Trust me, some of those things offended me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I have to say, a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Look where they were, Los Angeles, L.A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| I mean, these, you know, you can't compare community standards here to community standards in Los Angeles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| or South Beach, Miami or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| You can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| You know, the comparison is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| Here on our digital billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Angela Capps controls what is the content that goes on our digital billboards from our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| Sometimes from our home she does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| Right here, 24-year service she's been with us, 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| She controls, not someone across the country like they try to make you believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| No, she does it right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Before something goes on there, it's ran through spam filters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Even if she puts it on there, sometimes it's like a spam filter just like you have on your e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| It won't allow things to go up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| You know, a lot of political ads actually almost always automatically get kicked back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| when we try to put a political ad up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| But there's filters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| There's stopgaps for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| You know, the digital boards are monitored all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| If you see the cameras on them, we have a network operating center that monitors the boards all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| There's no scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| There's no blinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| There's none of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| That is controlled by the federal government as well as the state government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| This says you can't have scrolling, blinking, flashing lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| It's a static message that changes electronically to another static message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| You know, I'll talk about digital a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| You know, as far as, you know, the things that she's put in that e-mail about the bad things that were put on billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2256)|
| 0:37:44| you know, I set the standards here in this community as the vice president of Lamar here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| I set the standards of what I feel are good for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| They're not set by, you know, our corporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| We do have guidance from our corporate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| But really, every community is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| We're not going to accept things that are not good for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| And the bottom line is, have we ever had an issue with that here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| I mean, I've looked back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| I've asked people, have we ever had an issue with something being put on a billboard that people didn't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| or that was derogatory or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| You know, moving on to the property value study, I did read the property value study that was done in Philadelphia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| It's home values based on where the home is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| It's logical that homes located close to industrial commercial areas where billboards are allowed are going to have less value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2313)|
| 0:38:41| than, say, a home located on the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| And that's really how it spun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| I mean, it's a flawed study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| You should read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| I mean, that's how it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| I have another study done for the commercial property that the billboards are actually located on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| that shows that the value of the commercial property and industrial property goes up when the billboards are placed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2336)|
| 0:39:04| You know, so there's studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| They have their study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| We have our study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| And if you'd like me to e-mail you those studies, if I haven't, you know, I can do that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2348)|
| 0:39:14| One of the things that really offends me, and it was just brought up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| but it offends other people is, you know, we put up public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| and we help out organizations because, you know, they're strings attached, because we want something from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| You know, like I said, that offends me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| We do it because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| We do it across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| Lamar donates thousands and thousands, if not millions of dollars of public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| I mean, my employees have personal, you know, they have personal things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| They have people that have Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| They know people that have breast cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| They know children that have autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| These are the organizations that we support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And now we're getting, you know, like we're bad people because we help these people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| I can guarantee you, no matter what is voted on on this issue, I can guarantee you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| and I'll talk to those organizations, I'll guarantee you our support will always be there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| It will never waver, no matter how you all vote on this issue, because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| It's not because they're strings attached that we need something from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| You know, we don't go out looking for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| They come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| They ask for our help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| We more than graciously help them in any way we possibly can, because it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| One thing that I do agree on with Commissioner Briggs, we do agree on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2431)|
| 0:40:40| The ban on new billboards, you know, digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| and electronic messaging centers are three different issues, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| They are three different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| You know, you can't lump all of them into the same thing and just, you know, wipe away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| I mean, on the new billboard issue, yeah, we like to build new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| It's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| It's our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| That's how we grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| We like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| In fact, in the last ten years, Lamar has built eight billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| and we've taken down eight in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| On our part, there is no proliferation of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| There's nothing that's changed in the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| I mean, I don't know the other gentlemen, you know, in our industry around here what they can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| but I'd say if you looked at it, it's probably about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| You know, economic conditions change things to where billboards we have today aren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2488)|
| 0:41:36| you know, valuable anymore and we need to take them down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| and we need to have the ability to move with the times, with the traffic patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| You know, you change with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| I mean, that's what keeps our industry, you know, going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| And that's the reason I think it, you know, do we have enough billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| You know, that's everyone's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| A lot of opinions, but not a lot of facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| One thing about the EMCs, that's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| Do the EMCs need regulation and stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| I'd say, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| I mean, I've seen EMCs in other cities I've lived in, you know, explode across the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| to where they're showing Nike commercials on, you know, outside the golf headquarters store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| Who do they call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2541)|
| 0:42:22| Us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| They think it's us doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| It's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| We're regulated by the state and the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| We're not allowed to have flashing, scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| Our digital billboards cannot show a movie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| It's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| The sign that, you know, they said killed the guy down here on Gay and Summit Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| I mean, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| If that was in a police report that that sign killed somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| do you not think that public outcry would have that sign removed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| I think a flash mob or something would come down there and tear it off the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| if they thought that that was the reason, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| It's just not, you know, the sign is not what killed the guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| I don't know what did, but I think if it was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| put in a police report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2583)|
| 0:43:05| But, again, you know, EMCs, do they need regulated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| I would say yes, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| And as far as billboards, we welcome regulation on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| We welcome regulation on digital billboards, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| Ordinances, like everything, have to keep up with the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| Just to talk a little bit about digital billboards real fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| You know, I've given you about ten minutes now, Mr. Connelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| If you would, I think it would be appropriate to end it up pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| I'm going to end it up real fast just talking about digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| You know, I'd like to pass this out to everyone so everyone has a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| You know, traffic safety studies, there are tons of traffic safety studies out there that say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| digital billboards are not in any way a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| Federal Highways has a new one out, too, where they have done one, the Federal Highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| And I'd like to give it to you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| I have copies for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| So, you have to look at what the digital billboards can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| Hurricane Sandy right now, FEMA activated digital billboards in, let me see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| 25 offices across seven states with Lamar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| And I have a picture also attached in this that shows what they put up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| It says, prepare for Sandy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Water, meds, pet, checklist at ready.gov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| FEMA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| That's what we can do, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| We do AMBER alerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| The police departments call us, you know, an extra guy out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| It's new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| And with, you know, one thing with technology, governments aren't there to hold technology back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2673)|
| 0:44:42| That's not what, you know, that's not what you're there for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2682)|
| 0:44:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you, Mr. Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| I have one last thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Corny as it may sound, I really think that the not enough time and effort has been put into the thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| And, you know, we sent you an Asheville ordinance because everyone thinks Asheville banned billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Look how much time and thought was put into that Asheville ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| I think that's what needs to be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| I think the ban is a knee-jerk reaction to four years of inaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| That's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| We've got a light on, too, Mr. Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| You might stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Mr. Connelly, I don't know if you were here at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| I think we're here at another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| But I just want to take a quick second just to tell you that I appreciate your professionalism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| what you've just shown here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| And I said at the last meeting, I don't know about the billboard industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I want to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| That's why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| And you have evidently have corrected some things that you said that weren't true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| And I want that to happen on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| So if the other side hears something that they don't like, same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| But I just appreciate your professionalism and the way that you have presented this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| and give this information to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you, Mr. Connelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Next, Gary Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2766)|
| 0:46:18| My name is Gary Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| I'm a resident at 10040 Casa Real Cove in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| I have been in the outdoor advertising business since 1972.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| I worked in the corporate world for probably 15 of those years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| I left that business and started my own company in the late 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| I sold that company six or seven years ago and have very little to do with outdoor advertising today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| However, I think it's important for Brian made a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| This is not an easy decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| There's a lot to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| There's more to it than just a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| And how you get to the point to make an educated decision, it's tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| because you guys have a whole lot to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| And I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| But you just need to know you're dealing with jobs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| You really need to think about who utilizes outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| The people who our opposition is critical of the billboard, the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2839)|
| 0:47:28| They wouldn't exist if people didn't use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| They wouldn't exist if they did not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| I don't know if it's appropriate, but I would like to see if you folks have a problem with me asking our opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2856)|
| 0:47:46| what would they offer as an advertising solution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| A pilot oil company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| Anybody want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Pilot oil company, 600 travel centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| Six hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| They're probably the largest company in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| They certainly give this town a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| The Haslam's wouldn't be giving the money if they hadn't been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| One of the things they have to have to pull the people off the interstate system is a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2892)|
| 0:48:20| Why do you think Jim Haslam spends his money on a sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2900)|
| 0:48:29| Anybody want to offer another solution for Gene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| You got an idea what pilot could have used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| Mr. Douglas, this isn't really the format for that kind of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| No, I didn't know if it was or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2919)|
| 0:48:39| No, go right ahead with your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| But my point is there is no alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| If you can't pull people off the interstate and make an impulse decision, you have no business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| Cracker Barrel required two signs each direction on the interstate before they would go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2931)|
| 0:48:58| and put an investment of money to employ people, to serve the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2938)|
| 0:49:06| So the relation between that is that a ban doesn't take into consideration the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2946)|
| 0:49:15| It doesn't take into consideration, as time goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| if you're not able to adapt to the marketplace with good, strong regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| And that's what I've believed and have believed in forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| You're killing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| You're killing jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| And I think you really need to think about that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| You're not even giving them a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| And who knows what the next pilot oil might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| You know, what if you had a company come to Knoxville and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| we need to have some locations on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| You don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| And they're requiring it for their business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| So my point is that you do have strong regulations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| Believe it or not, you really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Not so much on the digital yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| But when we passed ordinances for the outdoor advertising ordinance probably 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| we increased spacing two and a half times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| We required everything to be built on single poles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| That got rid of the junk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| We, let's see here, we controlled the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3020)|
| 0:50:28| And you also need to remember that outdoor can only go into certain commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| Not all of them can even be built in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| And precious few zoning comes out of the planners that even allows outdoor to be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| even if you had the old ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| So they're killing it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| Well, you're killing the people that need to use it, is what I'm getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| So I just really wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| One of the things that really hit me the other day was the end result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| You heard it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Some folks don't want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| Some folks want them gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| Most folks want them gone, as our opposition says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| We're not sitting up here saying give us free reign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Brian Conley didn't say I want 100-foot spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| He didn't say I want to build them in residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| He didn't come in here asking for anything other than the opportunity to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| And to think that you're going to come down with anti-business legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| Commissioner Briggs, at a time when this country needs jobs, in my opinion, is absolutely wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| You need to let free enterprise play a part in the success or demise of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3096)|
| 0:51:43| When they stop working, they'll be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Trust me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| You have smart people making the decision to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| I mean, I think the housing's done pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| So I guess, of course, I could go on and on and on, but I'm going to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| I would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Mr. Conley, you've got some lights on, so there's going to be some people asking some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3122)|
| 0:52:07| If you want to stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3128)|
| 0:52:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Dr. Briggs, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| I think my light's the only one on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| If anybody had a question for him, I'll defer to them because I really don't have a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| but I'd like to answer the questions for the group out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| You said, what would Pilot do to advertise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| What would Cracker Barrel do to advertise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| What they'd do, they'd go to the Lamar Company and they'd buy space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| That's what they would do, just like they're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Just so everyone is clear, because I've heard this again and again, the argument against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| This is not to eliminate billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| This is not a ban on billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| Cracker Barrel wants to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| They go to Lamar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| They go to Olympus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| They go to, I think it's Mountain is the other one we see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| They go to somebody else and they buy billboard space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| They would do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| They would do that afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| And unless something changes, even if all these ordinance passes, they'll do this for the next 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| I've heard it say that this is to eliminate billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| It's not to eliminate billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| I've heard people say it's to ban billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| It's not to ban billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| The three parts of this ordinance, just to refocus what we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| it's to ban new conventional billboards, new digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| It's to ban the conversion of conventional billboards to digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| And it's to ban new electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| It has nothing to do with eliminating billboards, doing away with billboards or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| It's just a ban on new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| I forget how many we have in this county, 900 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| And all we're saying is that 900 is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3226)|
| 0:53:48| Do you want to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| The point I'm making, Commissioner Briggs, is that you don't even give the industry a chance to adapt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| And I'm going to make an analogy to your industry you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| Let's say that for some reason 30 or 40 years ago there was someone that said no more hospitals can be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| from downtown Knoxville and be built in the new market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| If you ban anybody from moving where the market is, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| That's where people have moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| And so that's the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| I understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| You're saying you're not going to take them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| All I'm saying is look at the orders you have right now in the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| and the spacing that would be required, the zoning they have to go in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| and they at least have the chance to exist to the new rules and new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| I understand your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| But the end game, the end game as development happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| Brian, you still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3286)|
| 0:54:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| Do you take boards down because of development, because property owners buy your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| and sometimes they come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| I mean, what Gary is trying to say is you have to come to the microphone, sir, if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| I'm Brian Conley again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| What Gary is trying to say is over time we lose leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| So we have 100 billboards this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Next year we've lost five leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| We can't rebuild those billboards because you ban a bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| You know, you passed an ordinance saying no new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3312)|
| 0:55:14| So, okay, after one year we're down from 100 to 95 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| The next year we lose five more leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| Now we're down to 90 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| So the following year we might lose 20 leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| We're not ñ and if you pass a ban, we're not able to build new billboards in different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| I mean, development happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| Turkey Creek came in, took a whole bunch of billboards down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| Things like that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| If we don't have the ability to adapt with traffic patterns, with development and things like that, over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3337)|
| 0:55:44| you know, our business will not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| I mean, not to use you, Commissioner Smith, here's a great analogy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3347)|
| 0:55:51| You sell insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| If we ban you from selling any new insurance policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| and then we ban you from upgrading your current insurance policies to, say, the new Emerald policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| what's going to happen over time as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| the people that have your policies find other people to do business with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| They, unfortunately, pass away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| What happens over time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| Sure, it might not be this year, next year, but 40 years down the road, what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| I mean, we want to supply jobs not just for the people that have worked for me for, like I said, a tenure of 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| We want to supply jobs for their children and hopefully their children's children down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| And when you ban, we're not able to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| You know, sooner or later, it's going to be down to no billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| And the opposition knows that, and that's why they push for the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| Anything else, Mr. Connery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3412)|
| 0:56:55| I just wanted to make, I wanted Brian, because he runs the big show in town, and they have the large numbers of boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3415)|
| 0:57:01| He deals with lessors all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| That's the real world that goes on in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3427)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you, Mr. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3428)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3429)|
| 0:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| A quick question for Brian or Gary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| Take that scenario you said, Brian, about to go from five down to 95, 95 down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3433)|
| 0:57:21| and then you're down to 80 or you're at 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| Would that then not make your billboard that more, if I'm an advertiser, that much more expensive because there's less of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3445)|
| 0:57:33| I think it would make our leases more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| It would make the cost of business for us more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| And, yes, we would have to turn around and pass that cost on to our advertisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| So for the small business that uses probably, I think probably four out of five is what it is ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3462)|
| 0:57:50| Four out of five businesses that use our billboards are small businesses with 50 or less employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| These are not people that can afford thousands and thousands of dollars for a billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| which is what, if that scenario would happen, is what we would have to charge to stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| So, there again, we wouldn't be able to sell it and we'd be out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3494)|
| 0:58:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I think it might be constructive to, rather than make this an emotional argument, try to put a little fact in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| I think it would be interesting to know how many locations and where they could be in this county today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3503)|
| 0:58:29| if you took the ordinance, not the ban, the ordinance that you have on the books now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3509)|
| 0:58:36| and see how many can even be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| They're just asking for the opportunity to exist in a free enterprise system, and that's shameful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| That's exactly how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Thank you again, Mr. Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3534)|
| 0:59:00| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| I'm here just as a citizen to say that I support the three ordinances that are being proposed regarding billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3547)|
| 0:59:16| Two specific things that have occurred to me while I've been sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| One, I can't say I've ever driven around Knox County or any place for that matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3559)|
| 0:59:23| and said, I think this place really would look better if it had a billboard here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| or this sight line would be improved a lot more with a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| So it's tough for me as a citizen and somebody that enjoys our beautiful county in East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| to support the idea of adding more visual clutter to the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3577)|
| 0:59:43| The second thing is the ordinance that talks about the transition from conventional to digital ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| I think that one's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| The digital billboards driving around at night, even the ones that do have dimmers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| and are somewhat light controlled, those are still bright things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Those impact property values and residents that are not only, you know, where that billboard is but across from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| So the digital billboards have a lot of concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| and that one I really feel quite strongly about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| I went up to Virginia a couple weekends ago with some friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| and we left early in the morning and it was still dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| And we got on I-40 and hit the first, go out there and like, geez, there's a really bright light in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3619)|
| 1:00:25| Well, it's the first billboard that you get to across the Sevier County line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| And one of my friends asked, well, when did we cross in Sevier County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| I said, well, I saw the county line about a half a mile ago, and here's the first example of something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3631)|
| 1:00:36| Not a real pleasant welcome to Sevier County at 530 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3636)|
| 1:00:42| And the last thing I'd say is there are alternatives to advertising on billboards that businesses can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3642)|
| 1:00:49| Most of us use our phones now to find out where businesses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| I would, you know, that's my generation and everybody younger than me and a lot of people older than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| In terms of on the highways, I really like those blue signs that we've got out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Here's the gas stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Here's the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Here's the attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Those are small, unobtrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| They're well-regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Those are easy to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3670)|
| 1:01:12| And that's what I use when I'm trying to figure out if I need to get off at an exodus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| Tell me what's there and I'll use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| I hardly ever look at the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| So I'm just offering an individual citizen's perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| And I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| And the last person I have signed up is Martin Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3687)|
| 1:01:53| Hello, gentlemen and ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| I'm Martin Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| My address is 1834 Duncan Woods Lane, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| I own and operate a majority owner and operator of Elevation Outdoor Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3722)|
| 1:02:08| And truth be told, I have a confession to make tonight in front of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| and in front of the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| I do not like to look at billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| Plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| I don't like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| As a matter of fact, I don't like to look at Walmarts, Costco's, Target's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| I don't like to look at Pilot Convenient Marts or Wagons or car dealerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3750)|
| 1:02:37| I don't like all those shiny steel things that blind me sometimes on a sunny day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| I don't like to look at grocery stores or pharmacies or those ugly shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| I don't like to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| I don't like to look at all that asphalt and steel that we have in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| And I don't like to look at the industrial sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| I was driving down Alcoa Highway today and I looked out and saw the mountains over there to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3777)|
| 1:03:03| as you're going south on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| And there it was, the Alcoa, big Alcoa plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| I didn't like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| I don't like McDonald's and Burger Kings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Not only do I not like the way they look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| I don't like what they do to society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I don't like the way that hospitals look either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| They're a big concrete steel block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3807)|
| 1:03:36| In reality, I would like for all of Knoxville and Knox County to be pristine and park-like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| But the plain fact is that we live in a nation and a state and a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| and in a county that is reliant and dependent on its economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| and on the businesses that are here as a part of that economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3838)|
| 1:04:07| By the way, businesses are just groups of people, many groups of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| Take, for example, Powell Travel Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| Is it really just a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| It's the people that work there and it's the people that they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| That's what Powell is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| And that's what McDonald's is or Target or Costco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3864)|
| 1:04:36| Few people would argue that the United States is the greatest economic success story in the history of mankind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| And in my opinion, it's the great economic success story because from its inception in the 18th century,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3884)|
| 1:04:54| we've had an environment in which entrepreneurs feel comfortable in starting businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| and hiring people and growing their businesses and hiring even more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| Also, there's a free flow of information whereby business owners can convey the facts concerning their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| to their potential consumers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| Here in Knoxville, let's look around and see what great examples of businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| and institutions that use outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| And some of these have very local roots, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| Again, Powell Travel Centers, Weigel's, Academy Sports, Kroger, United States Cellular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| Verizon, Wendy's, Banks, the Stovetop Regions, American Trust, BB&T, Jefferson Federal, real estate agents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3938)|
| 1:05:52| insurance agents, Budweiser, InBev, Cracker Barrel, Ruby Tuesdays, car dealers, Harper, Grayson, Mercedes, BMW,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3952)|
| 1:06:04| Berleo's Grill, Crown and Goose, Bricks, Salsarito, Charlie's, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| And those are not businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| Remember, those are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| Those are groups of people that use outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| They have a need for it and they use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| And don't forget the institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| The University of Tennessee, the University of Tennessee Sports, MTSU, Austin Peay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3982)|
| 1:06:31| Tennessee Tech, South College, Virginia College, Pellissippi State,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| and all those nonprofits we talked about last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=3999)|
| 1:06:46| The fact is that Knoxville and Knox County rely on its businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| Knox County relies on businesses using outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| We rely on them to provide their services and goods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4017)|
| 1:07:01| We rely on them to employ as residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| And we rely on them to pay their taxes, which they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4023)|
| 1:07:16| While it would be nice to live in a completely park-like environment here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4036)|
| 1:07:25| we must accept and should continue to accept necessary incidents of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4045)|
| 1:07:34| so that we can continue to live in a prosperous Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| I ask you, why ban a medium that businesses are demanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4061)|
| 1:07:51| that work for them, and that work for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4071)|
| 1:07:59| A complete ban on outdoor advertising, further ban on outdoor advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| is extremist and does not consider the needs of business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4086)|
| 1:08:16| I submit to you that a ban on further construction of outdoor advertising in Knox County is anti-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4096)|
| 1:08:24| It's anti-people, the people who work for those businesses and who are served by them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| It is anti-property right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| It simply restricts the right to use your property as you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4113)|
| 1:08:39| And it is anti-Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Thank you, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| I have no other people signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| Do I have someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Come ahead if you'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| Oh, one in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Go ahead, Margo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| You're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| I didn't sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| I didn't realize I needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4144)|
| 1:09:05| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| I've been home today, sick in bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I didn't especially want to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| I don't really feel like being here, but I am because it's important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| and I really appreciate all of you who are also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| I'd like to say a couple of things, and I'd like to respond to something that Mr. Connelly said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| I don't know Mr. Connelly, but he mentioned that he lives in the county on Shadowfax Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| I'm about 99.99 percent sure that's in the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4171)|
| 1:09:36| Town of Farragut doesn't have billboards, unless they're old ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Town of Farragut has an ordinance that says you can only have six-feet tall signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| Town of Farragut also has a good portion of Turkey Creek, which is one of the most successful business areas in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4185)|
| 1:09:52| I would wonder why someone would want to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| Well, maybe it's because it looks good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| I'll respond to something else that was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| I like Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| I like Publix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| I like Chewy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| I like Aldi's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| All of those places that have come in recently have low signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4210)|
| 1:10:14| It hasn't hurt their business one iota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| And we're not talking about signage today, but we are talking about sign clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4216)|
| 1:10:22| and the clutter that exists when you have a lot of billboards and bright lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4222)|
| 1:10:27| and you go down the road and you can't see any of the signs because there's so many of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4227)|
| 1:10:34| I'm pro-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| Prosperity is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| Making a profit is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| Having a good life is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| I'm concerned because if there is the ban is lifted and new billboards are allowed in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4243)|
| 1:10:51| there could be a billboard on Ebenezer Road, which is predominantly residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| However, there are parcels on that road that are zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| There could be new billboards out around Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| There could be new billboards out around Choteau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| Where would you put one if you were in that industry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I was in advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| I do graphic design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| I worked for Whittle Communications for 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| There's something called enlightened self-interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| There's also something called doing well by doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| You find your market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| You go to where the money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| The majority, the areas of Knox County with the highest per capita income are Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4296)|
| 1:11:43| which you're not going to touch because they have their own ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| and two or three tracts out in West Knoxville, which you can bet is where they would want to put billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4307)|
| 1:11:56| That's where I'd want to put one if I was in that business and I was interested in making money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| It's not in the best interest of the county from the standpoint of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4322)|
| 1:12:08| or the standpoint of our economic progress to allow unregulated growth of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4328)|
| 1:12:19| because too many people want to live not in a park, not in a park-like setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| but in an area that has low, discreet signage where they can have commercial businesses close by that are attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4344)|
| 1:12:35| but where they don't have to look at a glaring light blinding them as they drive down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4355)|
| 1:12:42| or 20 or 30 or 40 glaring signs that are so obtusive that you can't even focus on one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| Thank you, Ms. T.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| Really, we're not ñ I'll give you time at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4377)|
| 1:13:05| I moved to Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| I moved to Farragut, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| You know why I moved to Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| For the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| I looked at Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| I looked at every school system in this entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| I moved there for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| They could have had billboards up and down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| I wouldn't have cared, even if I wasn't in the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| I moved there because I have children and for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| And also, if you look at Farragut, Turkey Creek is like the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Businesses pay to be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| But if you look at Farragut, look at how many empty storefronts from small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| that can't survive in there because they have no signage out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4415)|
| 1:13:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Come ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| Hi, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| I'm Russell Ammons of 7920 Ewing Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| And I went ahead and wrote my thoughts down this morning because I wanted to be concise with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| and I thought it would just be better that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| I'm going to read it if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| Hi, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| Thank you for allowing the public and myself to stand before you as local citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| expressing our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| I'm a lifelong citizen of Knox County, a Powell High School graduate and a graduate of the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4448)|
| 1:14:14| I've raised three children in this community and started two small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| Fifteen years ago, my brother Danny and I started Outdoor Displays Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| It's a small billboard company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| We built our first billboard in a commercial area of North Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| When we started our billboard business in 1997, there were stringent regulations in place by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4469)|
| 1:14:36| and the state of Tennessee governing where billboards could and can be erected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| These stringent regulations are still in effect and have been tightened over the past 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| Since 1982, regulations have been in place where billboards can only be erected in commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| or industrial-type zoning locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Not only does Knox County regulate the locations of billboards, but the state of Tennessee does regulation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| Billboards on state-maintained roadways in Knox County can only be erected on commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| or industrial zone properties, and they cannot be closer than 1,000 feet of each other on the same side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4510)|
| 1:15:18| or within 1,000 feet of an entrance or an exit ramp of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| They cannot be a double-stacked billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| They must be smaller than a certain size, and under no circumstance may they be allowed in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| On secondary arteries such as highways, the state of Tennessee has the same restrictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| except they allow the signs to have spacing 500 feet apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| Not only must I meet the state of Tennessee stringent requirements, but Knox County has its own set of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| Knox County has limited its commercial and industrial zonings, but only in certain areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4552)|
| 1:15:59| and that are CA, CB, CH, and I zoned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4559)|
| 1:16:04| Knox County has increased the minimal distance requirement between billboards to be 750 radial feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| which is in all directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Knox County has a 50-foot height restriction, which the state of Tennessee does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| Knox County limits billboards which are within 300 feet of residential areas where they can't have lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| Knox County states that all new billboards must be of unipole or one single-column construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| The state of Tennessee allows wooden pole construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| These stringent regulations have been in effect since 1982.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| The state of Tennessee's Highway Beautification Office regulates the billboard signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| and routinely inventories our signs to make sure we are adhering to the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| The billboard industry is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| It is a commercial industry located in commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| Myself and my employees rely on the commercial business for our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| According to Mr. Bill Pierce of the Department of Codes Administration for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4621)|
| 1:17:06| there have only been 126 billboards permitted in Knox County since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| Dr. Briggs says there's 900 billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| There's no way there's 900 billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| There's 126 permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| And Bill said right there, I've got a letter stating this, and most billboards are two-sided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| So there's probably only been 60 to 70 billboards constructed since 1985.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4648)|
| 1:17:38| That's 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| These were all in commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| There has not been an overwhelming number of signs in any one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| For the past four years of the Mortium, there have been zero signs permitted in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| I ask you commissioners to please remove the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| and allow new signs to be erected in developing commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| Most existing commercial locations cannot have additional signs erected due to the effective regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4683)|
| 1:18:11| in place by Knox County which limit the number of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| I desire the ability to permit and construct new billboards which adhere to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| and to Knox County's existing stringent regulations in developing commercial areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| As the county grows and its commercial needs expand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| I want to be able to expand my business with billboards in the newly expanded commercial areas of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| Knox County needs expanding commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| With it comes large tax bases, additional tax revenue, and most importantly, new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| Let's face it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| Our economy is stagnant and failing in many areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Our taxes are increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| Our debt is overwhelming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| Revenues are falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Businesses are closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| Mom and dads are out of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| And families are failing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| America needs opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| Knox County needs opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| Businesses need opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| Please, I ask you to remove this moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| Just to please, to remove the moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| and allow billboards to be erected in commercial areas and commercial areas to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4762)|
| 1:19:28| Allow us to generate additional revenue which may employ additional workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| Allow us to expand our operations in commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| I'm not asking you to deregulate our industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| Just remove the moratorium and let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| and let the existing stringent regulations continue to limit the number of billboards in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| Thank you, Mr. Emmons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| Come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4798)|
| 1:20:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4807)|
| 1:20:07| I didn't mean to be here on time, but I had company come to my house and so I was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| I should be on your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| My name is Doug Veah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| I live at 1023 Kiwi on West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| But I'm here more as a driver than I am as a resident of a particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| So I want to address the electronic billboards and that particular ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| My recommendation to you is that all electronic billboard signs be banned from alongside high-speed highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| and from busy surface city streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| Electronic signs are a big distraction to the driver because they are very bright and they move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| The messages are poorly designed to be read quickly and easily, which makes the distraction even more dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| I don't know who designs these things, but it's certainly somebody who doesn't drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4848)|
| 1:20:52| The electronic billboard seems to want to hold the eye of the driver longer than I think must be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| The fact that I suspect that fact I suspect is both a function of the sign's brightness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| and the amount of information the sign tries to convey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| It seems that any effort to make a sign quickly comprehensible and memorable has been forgotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| by those who design the display and electronic billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| These displays are designed like a print ad with more detail than can be absorbed in a period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| that is safe for drivers to take their eyes off the road and the traffic ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| The electronic billboard takes too much time to read because of how the message is designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| and because it is bright and changing, it is a powerful distraction for any driver on a busy highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| Any driver on a busy highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| The powerful impact on the eye of an electronic billboard make it very easy to sell, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| for those who are selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| I've bought a lot of billboard advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| Those are one of the things you really want to have in a billboard is it's catchy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and it returns a substantially higher income, I would think, to the owner than does the standard billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| because you can have a lot more people on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| But that quality being flexible and noticeable is also the quality that makes them a big distraction to drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| I simply say that an electronic advertising billboard should not be allowed on a public street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| or highway for any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Public service electronic billboards also need to be thought out very carefully so that the message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| on them doesn't become too long and therefore hold the attention of the driver too long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| to convey the whole message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| TDOT needs to be thinking about how they use those four or five lines on that highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| because you're going by that at 70 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| You don't pick that up that quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| Until you can be assured that the designers of messages on the electronic billboards will always design a message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| as simply conveyed to the reader as the old Volkswagen gas panes billboard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4952)|
| 1:22:38| I would ban all electronic billboards until that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| Thank you, Mr. Vina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4964)|
| 1:22:45| I have a quick question for Roy and Bill over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| I think I said something over here that sort of jogged my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| I'm here, like I say, I'm here to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| If this goes through as it is now, we couldn't build anything new unless we rezoned something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4977)|
| 1:23:08| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Or are there spots now where more billboards could go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| How's that, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4993)|
| 1:23:14| Yeah, I'm sure there are some spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| Probably less desirable than the most desirable ones, I'm certain, have already been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| But there are some spots that would still be, I think, usable and wanted by billboard companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| Are we talking five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5007)|
| 1:23:28| Are we talking 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| What do you estimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| I think the billboard industry can answer that question better than I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5010)|
| 1:23:33| Anybody want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| How many would be available today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5016)|
| 1:23:43| You're going to have to come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| If you'd like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| This is Russ Ammons again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| There's no way of accurately knowing that because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| there's pieces of property that are zoned commercial continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| But it's all market-driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| If there's a demand there, then there would be a need for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| So what you're asking, Bill has no way of knowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| But, you know, it's not profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| You know, if we were to put signs up on every commercial piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| it would be out of business because no one would rent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| I mean, the way I'm seeing this bill is then we're pretty much set now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| And the only way we're going to get new billboards is if new commercial is developed in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| that would that's in the area that you guys would permit and MPC would permit one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5068)|
| 1:24:36| Is this what we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| That's probably true for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| It would not surprise me if there are some current zones right now that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| where they might want to put a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5085)|
| 1:24:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| We've got another question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| We'll get to you, Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| It's actually not a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| I'd like to get a copy of the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| We were trying to look for it on the computer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| And the current split ordinance that's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| Daniel, do we have that constructed yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5106)|
| 1:25:07| And I can get you a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5107)|
| 1:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Yes, sir, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| My name is Dale Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| I live at 6803 Mundell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| And I have a small business, a small sign company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| It's Modern Outdoor Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| I spoke last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| I was a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| There was a lot of stuff I needed to say that I didn't get said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| Probably the, you know, I'm probably the one that it's going to affect most, right, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| right off the bat when you all vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| It just shuts my business down pretty much totally because I am a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| I don't have 900 signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| I don't have 50 signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| I have 17 signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| And, you know, the fact that I cannot build no more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| I'd have to look for another county to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| And I've lived in this county all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| And I've run a business here all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| You know, it wouldn't negatively affect my business, you know, right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| And I hope you all don't vote no more billboards because it is my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5161)|
| 1:26:14| There's a couple of things, you know, about advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| Everybody needs advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5177)|
| 1:26:18| All small businesses need advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| If you have a small business, you need advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5180)|
| 1:26:24| The guy before me, I don't know his name, but he was saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| I don't have LED billboards, but, you know, he had billboards to sell for his business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| but he didn't like the digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| But he did use billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| And I guess everybody in this room, you know, if they had a business, they'd want to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| And billboards is the most effective way, the most cost-effective way that you can advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5199)|
| 1:26:46| And I think that you need more billboards because all the tourists coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| they need to know where to get off the interstate, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| Direct them on to the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| Their board is telling them, right there on 75, there's a board directing all the tourists to Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| You know, in Gatlinburg, once you get past Pigeon Forge, you know, there's no billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| If you want no billboards and nothing blocking your scenery, go to the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| But, you know, don't shut our business down because somebody wants to look at the mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| Let them drive up there and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| And the lady from Farragut, you know, have discreet signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| You know, why would you want a discreet sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| You can't see a sign that's discreet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| It's hiding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| You know, I wish I had the money to live in Farragut, but I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| You know, I run a business right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| You know, I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| I guess that's why I'm so nervous up here because I am struggling so much, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| And it does negatively affect my business, you know, to the most extreme extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| It's like losing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| And on the digital billboards, I probably never will have enough money to build one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| That's just, you know, nothing to me pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| I do work on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| You know, I service them and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| And I do like the digitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| I think if you completely ban digitals, you're just saying, you know, our county don't have no room to grow at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| And I still think you need to leave some room for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| They may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| I mean, they've named a bunch of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| They've named a bunch of advertisers up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| There's probably tens of thousands of businesses that use advertising, use billboards, you know, for their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5299)|
| 1:28:25| And everybody in Knox County that has a business looks for advertising anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| And the guy said something about using his cell phone to find, you know, find a location to eat or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5310)|
| 1:28:38| I can't imagine, you know, trying to direct everybody on I-75 at 5 o'clock in the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| getting on your phone, trying to find a place to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| And you go over, and there's a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5327)|
| 1:28:48| You say, okay, I'm going to eat here at Cracker Barrel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5328)|
| 1:28:50| You know, and you get right off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5330)|
| 1:28:51| You're not on your cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| That should be against the law anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| Ban cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Don't ban billboards for advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| But I apologize again for being so nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| Like I said, it just upsets me, the fact that, you know, I'm going to lose my job pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5345)|
| 1:29:10| So I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Thank you for listening to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| Thank you, Mr. Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| You don't need to apologize for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| You know, and I appreciate, you know, what everyone said tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| And I think we've all tried to listen very respectfully to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| You know, the one thing that I don't understand is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| we talk about the jobs that will be lost if we put a ban on new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5371)|
| 1:29:38| Knoxville has had a ban now for over 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| And how have we stayed in business if we've had a ban for 11 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| I mean, businesses can get by with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| Knox County has had a ban for over four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| It's been really four and a half years because I believe it was in April or May of 2008 when we passed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5393)|
| 1:29:59| And, you know, people somehow or another have adjusted if you haven't done any business in 11 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5399)|
| 1:30:07| or you haven't done any business in four and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| I mean, I'm addressing this to you, so you still have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| Well, I just wanted to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| Yeah, you had a moratorium on it for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Yeah, I hadn't been able to build a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| And I actually got fired from Lamar for building signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| and therefore I can't even push my company forward because I can't get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| And I have tried to get to three permits, and I can't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| And, you know, to my understanding, the moratorium ain't supposed to stay on but six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| And I do not understand how you off kept it on for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| It was because of what Lamar did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| Lamar has a suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| And we were waiting for that to be settled so we didn't make some ordinance that would ultimately be declared illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5440)|
| 1:30:48| If Lamar did not have the suit, we would have taken care of this four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5448)|
| 1:30:53| So the problem is within the industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| Well, I don't have nothing to do with that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| I still love the people at Lamar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| I always have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| I worked for them for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5461)|
| 1:31:02| They were real good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| They're a good company to work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| They have probably 50 of my friends that works over there, and they've got families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| I want to say something for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| You know, they need their jobs, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| We need to keep this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| You know, we need to keep our jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| No matter what we do, you know, you've got your regulations already on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| It's hard enough to build one now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| But, you know, you're affecting a lot of people by banning billboards totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5482)|
| 1:31:28| Well, we're not banning billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| We're banning new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5489)|
| 1:31:30| I just want to make that clear again because we're not banning billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| Well, you might as well say you're banning them to me because I can't get on new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| I have so many, and, you know, my business don't grow like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| But I just want to make another point also that regardless of what we do here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| Knoxville has had a ban on billboards for 11 years or ten and a half years, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| And that's not going to change no matter what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| And I know there's been this talk about stymieing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| but I think if you look at downtown Knoxville and if you look at the growth of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| there's probably been more growth in Knoxville since they banned billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| than there was probably 20 or 25 years prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| Well, I would think myself city of Knoxville probably has enough billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| I will agree, you know, with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| And that's why they banned them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| I don't think the county has enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| You know, I don't think there's been enough studies done, you know, for anybody in this room to say there's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5539)|
| 1:32:27| Actually, you know, all I'm saying, I'm talking from my heart, I'm going to lose my job if y'all ban billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| I want my company to grow for my family, you know, and I've got grandbabies now, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5551)|
| 1:32:36| And we all want to see our families do good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5556)|
| 1:32:40| And my family's in it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| And, by the way, I do agree with you about banning the cell telephones when you're driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| I think that would be a good idea, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| Well, that's an alternative to billboards, you know, and I don't think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5568)|
| 1:32:52| I just think I had to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| I'd like to comment a little bit about the city versus the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| The city really doesn't have room to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| I mean, there's not a whole lot of, you know, they're redoing brownfields and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| We've got land that's going to grow, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| And Ms. Kline was speaking to Hardin Valley and Ebenezer and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| Well, the regulations wouldn't allow it on Hardin Valley because it's in the technology corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5595)|
| 1:33:20| Pellissippi's not allowed to have billboards because it's a scenic highway by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5600)|
| 1:33:24| So there's we're talking about minimal, and this is kind of a double-edged sword to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| but we're talking about minimal sites anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| We're talking about a very small area of Knox County that we're closing off for growth with a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| Now, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| No, we're not because every, if nothing changes, every billboard in this town could be converted to digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5619)|
| 1:33:46| Well, I'm talking about new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| You know, digital, I could probably compromise on digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| But when you're talking about new structures, the city has very little room to grow industrial-wise, business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5632)|
| 1:33:59| I mean, there's brownfields to redo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| And so the billboard demand is not going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5641)|
| 1:34:05| It's going to be in the county where we have to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5645)|
| 1:34:07| And the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| That's the argument, the difference in the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5651)|
| 1:34:12| The other thing is, as I know we talk about, it's an economic necessity to bring good jobs in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| Most of these industries or most of these businesses that we're talking about that advertise on the billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5657)|
| 1:34:24| the ones that I see are, you know, Target, Cracker Barrel, Pilot, Weigel's, adult bookstore, Mouse's Ear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5664)|
| 1:34:37| you know, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5677)|
| 1:34:38| We're not talking about high-paying jobs that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| the type of things that we're trying to recruit in, the Shonies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| You know, we're talking about minimum wage jobs or actually salaries that are less than minimum wage jobs that depend on tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| So, you know, there are some businesses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| But just look, I've become a lot more aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| First of all, there's three adult bookstore billboards when I go home tonight that I'll be looking at before I get to where I get off the 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5696)|
| 1:35:06| And the businesses that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| these are not the businesses that normally the Chamber of Commerce said that we're recruiting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| And I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5715)|
| 1:35:16| But those people, the people that come off the interstate and pay sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| the tourists that don't use our school systems and don't use our roads and pay the sales tax off the interstate, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5721)|
| 1:35:27| But I think it's also, it may be a true, true unrelated argument, you know, about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| is that I'm not sure that these businesses, it's just like one gentleman said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5732)|
| 1:35:39| the little blue signs with the square things, if you want to know where to eat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| I know when I get ready to look to get off the interstate to get gas when I drive to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| because I can't remember where all the places are, I'm going to stop and get a cup of coffee real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| I'm really looking at those little blue signs more than I am the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| And I do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| But we ran into that on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| There's only, you can only put four or six on, you know, the new Chick-fil-A coming on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| He had to get two billboards because he couldn't get on the blue sign for the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| because it's limited to the closest six that want to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| So you're picking winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| And so, I mean, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| That may be something that we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| I think we could expand those blue signs, but you're limited to six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| and the closest six to the exit get to participate and the ones that are distant don't get to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| And so how do they advertise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| We're picking winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| How much do you pay for that, Brad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Yeah, it's $600 a year, I think, to TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5789)|
| 1:36:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Any other comments or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| Is that Ms. Greave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| Go ahead and give your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Because I did call early in the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| Yeah, give name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| I'm Marsha Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5812)|
| 1:36:53| I live at 3640 Escagna Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| And I really appreciate the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| Since some of the commissioners were unable to attend the last forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| I'm first going to just briefly recap two points that I made in my remarks then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| One of the points was please consider the impact of the number of billboards that currently saturate our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5829)|
| 1:37:18| and why do we want to add to that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| Before the city of Knoxville got a ban on new billboards and on digitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5841)|
| 1:37:26| records showed that the city alone had close to 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5846)|
| 1:37:30| Now, it is true that I think in the county since 85 they added 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| So you have about 620 perhaps in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5855)|
| 1:37:40| But also consider double that number when you consider the billboards have two panels which advertise on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5860)|
| 1:37:48| So you're really getting more than just one image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| My second point is that to me building more billboards and increasing tourism are at cross purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5872)|
| 1:38:01| At a recent state tourism conference convened by Governor Bill Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| it was revealed that Tennessee moved to the number nine spot of top tourism states in the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| up from its previous position at number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| Governor Haslam then asked that efforts be redoubled in our state to attract visitors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5897)|
| 1:38:24| as the economic impact in 2011 was $15.36 billion in sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5904)|
| 1:38:32| The Knoxville area alone increased in tourism by 8.8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| Right now the Knoxville area is becoming a destination city with its urban wilderness corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5919)|
| 1:38:45| waterfront development, downtown preservation efforts, and the East Tennessee History Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| Obviously, with the natural beauty of East Tennessee's green landscapes, hills, and lakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| this area is also attracting more visitors because of groups like Legacy Parks Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| which is promoting this area as an outdoor recreation city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| We are obviously extremely fortunate to live in an area blessed by unique natural beauty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| that is probably our greatest asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| Now, unfortunately, billboards are excellent at hiding many of our natural landscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5959)|
| 1:39:28| Think about how tourists are inundated with intrusive billboards and signs as they enter our area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5968)|
| 1:39:36| from either Chapman Highway, Clinton Highway, Kingston Pike, or I-40 West and East, among others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5976)|
| 1:39:45| In a 2011 study on billboard control, Urban Land Institute fellow Ed McMahon said that communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5985)|
| 1:39:53| who protect their distinctive character and uniqueness, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| the main reason people want to visit, remain more economically viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| In fact, at the last forum, Jill Thompson of the Knoxville Tourism Alliance said that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| around 9,000 people employed in the tourism business in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| Now, just think how many more jobs will be created in tourism in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| if we can safeguard what makes East Tennessee unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| And please contrast that with the amount of jobs created by billboard companies in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| and even less probably if billboards are converted to digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6036)|
| 1:40:42| In other words, tourism is going to bring us a heck of a lot more jobs than the billboard industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| Now, I would like to just move into the topic of digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| Basically, at least from my viewpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| digitals are the driving force in the billboard industry today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| and are specifically designed to draw your eye away from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| They are brighter and more intrusive than standard billboards, and thus add more to visual clutter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6067)|
| 1:41:15| In addition, I offer you some quotes to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| which were taken directly from the Watch Fire Digital Outdoor website, and it was entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6079)|
| 1:41:26| Strategies to Succeed with Digital Billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6086)|
| 1:41:30| Quote, digital outdoor is more targeted and harder to ignore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6090)|
| 1:41:37| Quote, just how profitable can it be to go digital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Monthly revenue can increase by six to eight times after converting to digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6101)|
| 1:41:48| Quote, digital billboards provide a great way to open up a market that is stymied due to local ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6108)|
| 1:41:57| and restrictions on new billboard installations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| Unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| My last point is, and unfortunately since I got here late, I had just a sheet that I would like to pass around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| It's time to dim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| I took some pictures off of Kingston Pike because I was curious about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| There are so many billboards intermingled with regular on-premise business signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| and I wanted to just give you an idea of this, and if we have time I can pass that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| But I understand that the county billboards, as someone mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| must be at least 750 feet apart from each other along major corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6155)|
| 1:42:41| But I'd always wondered why I see the big billboards intermingled, like I said before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| What I learned is that billboards already in place can then be surrounded by businesses who own property right next to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6166)|
| 1:42:55| So that's something I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| I get the impression that we have no restrictions, like you can have a billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| and if you're a small business right next door, they can start putting their signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| So then you've got these huge billboards in the middle of all the on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| So anyway, those are some examples of, and you can see the billboards intermingled there with the business signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6191)|
| 1:43:20| The other reason I'm bringing up this issue is to respond to a question that Commissioner Smith asked at the last forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6200)|
| 1:43:29| about how banning new billboards will affect commercial roads that will be built in the future in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6209)|
| 1:43:36| So my question is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| If new billboard construction is allowed to continue, what methods would we have in place to avoid what you see in these photos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6218)|
| 1:43:48| happening again on new roads into or around the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| And I would definitely like to make clear that I am definitely not anti-business, lived here for 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6233)|
| 1:44:03| love this community, and I'm definitely not against on-premise business signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6243)|
| 1:44:09| But I am opposed to the proliferation of billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| In conclusion, I just want to say that I'm speaking because I care deeply about this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6254)|
| 1:44:20| and the impression it makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| Legal precedent has shown that local communities can make rules about how they want their community to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6264)|
| 1:44:32| A recent example which was mentioned earlier, for instance, in the Brentwood area in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6272)|
| 1:44:37| and there are many, many examples across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| I would ask that County Commission take this opportunity to do something positive to benefit our entire community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6280)|
| 1:44:51| not the commercial interests of a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| Thank you so much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| Thank you, Ms. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| We have another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| Would you like to speak, Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6303)|
| 1:45:11| Good evening now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| I'm Jill Thompson, and I'm the executive director of the Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6314)|
| 1:45:21| Just a ---- Marcia, we had changed our name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| We had changed our name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| And your address, Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| It's 7520 Hollycrest Lane, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| I had sent, you gentlemen, a letter this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| I was not sure if I was going to be able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6338)|
| 1:45:41| And if you don't ---- if you will indulge me a little bit, I'd like to read it, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6341)|
| 1:45:49| First, I would like to thank the Ammons Brothers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| I was ---- when their first billboard went up, I was a hotel owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| I was probably one of the first customers of theirs, so it helped me tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6355)|
| 1:46:06| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| A possible decision to ban new billboards in Knox County will have a significant impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| on the vitality of the business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| Many in the lodging industry include billboard advertising in their marketing plans due to its effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6380)|
| 1:46:28| Since the last public meeting, Knox County hotels were sent an informal survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| They were asked if they used billboards, what percentage of their business came from billboard advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| and if they thought it was an effective form of advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| From those who responded, the results were 6% had not used billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| 4% had used billboards in the past but were not using them at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| 10% said less than 5% of their business came from billboard advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| 40% attributed billboard advertising for 6% to 15% of their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6416)|
| 1:47:04| 20% felt that 16% to 25% of their business was from billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| and 20% responded that more than 25% of their business came to their property through billboard advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6428)|
| 1:47:17| Some of the comments that they were able to make on this survey included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| my hotel does not have interstate visibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| My billboards drive theirs, the traveler's, business into my hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6446)|
| 1:47:31| Travelers appreciate billboards so they know what is available in a city for entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6451)|
| 1:47:36| restaurants, shopping, and hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| Billboards increase business in a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| Billboards are useful to the promotion of my hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| Travelers may make reservations for their final destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| However, they do not normally make lodging reservations for a midway overnight stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| They know, as we all do, that there are many variables when traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6475)|
| 1:47:59| They instead make those decisions as the day goes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| The same principle applies when they are deciding where to eat during their trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| Because of Knox County's geologically centered location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| the use of billboard advertising has proven to be an effective way to attract this incremental business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6492)|
| 1:48:19| The travel and tourism industry is the number one purchaser of outdoor advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| However, the citizens are the number one benefactor from these marketing efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| By marketing and advertising our businesses through billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| we are an economic driver for the community by bringing in outside dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| Recent economic impact figures for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| released by the Tennessee Department of Tourist Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| show that tourism accounted for 44.64 million in state sales tax and 20.7 million in local taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6524)|
| 1:48:54| Because of tourism spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| each household in Knox County realized a savings of $367 in local taxes in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6536)|
| 1:49:04| The industry also provides jobs for, as Ms. Grief stated, over 9,000 Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| Tourism contributes to the economic health of Knox County, and the industry continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6551)|
| 1:49:17| There are five hotels under construction and two others in the development stage in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6557)|
| 1:49:24| National restaurant chains have recently opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| and several are considering a Knox County location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| showing that the area has great potential for new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| In order to reach their full earning potential, they will rely on tourism dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| And TDOT recently determined that the use of digital signs on interstates was an effective means of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| and implemented installation of these signs across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6586)|
| 1:49:53| Regulation and guidance for billboard application in commercial and industrial areas is encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| and preferred rather than a ban on new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| Perimeter hotel properties and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| and those that cannot be seen from the interstate in particular depend on this form of advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6606)|
| 1:50:12| To reduce or diminish the availability of billboards could have a devastating effect on their profitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6612)|
| 1:50:18| We sincerely hope you will give a great deal of consideration to the business aspect of billboard installation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6618)|
| 1:50:26| And as an aside, I was able to speak to a UT class today on the hospitality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6626)|
| 1:50:33| excuse me, Retail Hospitality and Tourism Management Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| and I did pose the question about billboard advertising to these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| And you'll have to see that they are the incoming class, the refreshment class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| And I asked, do you use, do you watch billboards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| Do you look for billboards when you're going back and forth to home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| And they said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| And I said, what about your phones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| And one young lady sitting right in front of me, she says, oh, no, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6657)|
| 1:51:03| You'll get a ticket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| I went, you will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| She goes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| So it was evidently a personal note on her part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| I thank you for listening to all of us this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| And I trust you all will make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Thank you, Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| Anyone else like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6686)|
| 1:51:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6690)|
| 1:51:31| Well, that concludes, I assume, concludes our public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| This item will be taken up on the November in our November agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| November, not October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| So there may be a discussion item or it may be further entertained in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| I don't know what we've got right now on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| Thank you for your attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121029Special?start=6715)|
