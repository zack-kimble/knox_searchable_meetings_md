| 0:00:32| Help us this week especially to call upon our hearts to give thanks for the many blessings that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=32)|
| 0:00:40| the freedoms that we have, the opportunities and the challenges that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=40)|
| 0:00:46| It truly makes life very meaningful, and it is our desire to be servants of yours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=46)|
| 0:00:53| that this community, this city, may be so much a better place because of all of the citizens who live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=53)|
| 0:01:02| and all they give of themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=64)|

| 0:01:28| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=88)|

| 0:01:34| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Councilman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| I think the only item on our agenda is to return to the postponed item discussing the NSP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=104)|
| 0:01:49| There are several folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| I know Ms. Rojero also has some things to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=111)|
| 0:01:54| Mr. Lawler is here to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| So I guess I'm looking to council for their desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=118)|
| 0:02:03| Would you like to hear the speakers first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Would you like to hear Ms. Rojero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Would you like to hear the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| I'm seeing several voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| I would concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Ms. Roddy, do you have a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| I'm wondering if since some of the information has changed since we met last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| I wonder if it would make sense to hear from Ms. Rojero first to give that review and then from the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| Maybe just the update with the change that we've gotten, THGA, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| That's what I would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| I think that would be best also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| We'll go ahead with everybody's kind of nodded assent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| We will do that, and then we'll go to the folks who signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| Madeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| Well, thank you, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Thanks for this special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| It has allowed us to both receive more public comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| You know, the public comment period is officially over tomorrow at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| We have passed out to you a summary of the public comments so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| There are 64 comments that have been summarized, I think three from the public meeting last week, the council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=178)|
| 0:03:07| 61 that we've received through e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| I was just talking to Becky on the way over, and for our annual plan process, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| we have two public meetings, a council workshop, five-and-a-half months in planning for about a $5 million budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| We receive something like 25 or 30 comments at the public meetings, but zero comments by e-mail at the very end of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| So we were very pleased that we received these many comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| There are actually two more that came out actually in support of the plan after this was summarized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| and then we'll still keep collecting these until 430 tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=219)|
| 0:03:43| As I mentioned in my e-mail to you on Friday, the things changed Friday afternoon in terms of we got word from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=223)|
| 0:03:56| that they had decided that in their draft plan that had been posted in which we had been, we had talked with THDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| and they said, yes, go ahead and put that in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| They had decided to not, their board, their grants allocation committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| and their board decided not to include the allocation to other cities as they had designated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=251)|
| 0:04:18| they had delineated all the different cities and how much money they would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| They decided not to submit that to HUD in their annual plan or in their amendment that's due on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=262)|
| 0:04:29| but instead they would meet again in January and decide on those allocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=269)|
| 0:04:34| We were told, of course, nothing's set until it's voted on, but we were told that it was likely that we would get funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=274)|
| 0:04:44| and even likely we might get the same amount of funds, but we won't know for sure until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| So that meant that we needed to revise the draft plan that had been posted on the website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| and that you all had reviewed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| In revising the draft plan, our intent was to preserve the original intent of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=297)|
| 0:05:03| since that's the plan that's been out on the website and had been discussed for over a week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| and we wanted to protect the integrity of the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| So I sent you not only a revised plan but also a summary sheet, this sheet here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| and in that sheet it showed both the original proposal and then in the gray area the revised proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=321)|
| 0:05:30| And when we on Monday finalized these changes, we also put it up on the city website and sent out notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=330)|
| 0:05:40| tried to get it on the blogs and the listservs so that people would be aware that this was revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| I can go into, there are questions I can go into details on this later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=346)|
| 0:05:54| but in essence we have preserved each of the projects except for the infrastructure for housing development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=354)|
| 0:06:02| which was $60,000 that we would have conducted, done in-house to try and do some utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=362)|
| 0:06:09| and storm drainage extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| This is something that we've been wanting to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| We took that off and then we basically adjusted in order to keep the integrity of the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| In addition, where there were other sources of funding that could be used, such as for Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| we propose if the NSP dollars don't come in from the state, we propose that the city still contribute the $1.635 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=386)|
| 0:06:35| but we would use home dollars and we would use additional house program income funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| We prefer not to use those if we don't have to because home creates certain complications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=401)|
| 0:06:50| It just makes it a tougher deal to put together, tougher monitoring actually afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| It can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| It's routinely used for these projects and we would have used it for these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| except that this NSP, these funds became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| In addition, with the house funds, we have a little more flexibility with those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| so we like to keep those in our housing program when we need that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| However, they both legitimately can be used for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| So anyway, again, I think I explained pretty well in the revised description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| but I'll be glad to talk to you about those in a minute or if you have the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| The new resolution that is before you that I worked with the law department on this afternoon actually calls for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=447)|
| 0:07:35| because of these changes, we're requesting that you basically approve the revised plan, which is Exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=455)|
| 0:07:47| That's correct, isn't it, Debbie, Law Director Poplin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=467)|
| 0:07:53| Exhibit A is the revised plan, and what we're asking in the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| if you look at page 3 of the resolution, we're asking that you approve this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=480)|
| 0:08:13| that reflects the allocation of the direct NSP funds from HUD in the amount of the $2.735 million, which is Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=493)|
| 0:08:22| and that you further authorize us to submit a revised amendment to reflect the allocation of the additional NSP funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=502)|
| 0:08:30| in the amount of the $1.8 million in the event that such funds are received from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=510)|
| 0:08:35| So basically what we are saying is approve Exhibit A, which is the revised plan for the lesser amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=515)|
| 0:08:42| today, but also authorize us, should those funds come through at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=522)|
| 0:08:48| to go ahead and submit the revised amendment, which would be Exhibit B, which is actually the first one you looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| because that's the one that was out on the website, that's the one that we've received the public comment on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| and then we wouldn't have to come back from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| We could hit the ground running once the state decides on their allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| If the state decides on a different allocation, then we'll still have to come back to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| but in the event that we get the same one, we'd like to just be able to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| So that's the resolution that's before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| I just want to remind you that this is just the plan that has to be submitted by December 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| With such short notice, our intent was to build upon existing neighborhood stabilization strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=571)|
| 0:09:40| and initiatives that this department and this administration has already been involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| We wanted to build upon the core competencies of both my staff in the Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| and those of our nonprofit partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| The plan still has to be approved by HUD, and then the plan can later be amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| according to HUD regs and our citizen participation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| if as we move forward we see that there's something that won't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| And finally, each of these subrecipient projects have to come back to you for approval as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| So our intent today is to get a plan approved, and we hope you will support this plan that's before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=616)|
| 0:10:25| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I'm going to move now to the public, the folks who have signed up to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| By our rules, we have the folks in favor speak first and then against speak second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=631)|
| 0:10:40| There's two in favor, three against, and one that's sort of half and half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| So I'm going to ask the two who are purely for to speak first, and they can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| I would remind everybody who's getting up to speak, this is something we've talked about several times in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| so we welcome your information and your view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| If it's something that we've said before, let's try to kind of keep that to a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| and make any points that we have that are new tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| First up to speak in favor is Kelly Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=665)|
| 0:11:17| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| I'm Kelly Schultz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| I'm the director of Knoxville Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| I just wanted to come forth and state my request for you to approve this funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| This is money that Habitat for Humanity International actually worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| and our advocacy office in Washington worked very hard with Congress to get many months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=691)|
| 0:11:37| This is something that would benefit Habitat for Humanity all across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| And we were very excited when it was approved to see that it would be something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| as affiliates across the country, we could do to go in and help our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=708)|
| 0:11:53| With this request, Madeline has included us in this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=713)|
| 0:11:57| and with our funding we would use the money to purchase foreclosed or blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| Looking at the possibility of doing some rehab, we haven't done that before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| but I've got a very anxious, energetic construction staff looking to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| We are moving to a greener building model, starting two Saturdays ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| going towards an earth craft certification with all of our houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| So we're doing a lot of shifting and moving forward in our building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| and are very excited about being part of the communities in which we're vested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| and this money would be helpful to be able to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Second is Ginny Weatherstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=757)|
| 0:12:47| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| I had just a couple of points that I wanted to make, particular to the MinnVilla project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| There has been a great deal of talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| and one thing that I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware of is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| MinnVilla offers a permanent solution to the problem of homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| It is permanent, supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| And yet, as I say permanent, and what that means is that it does carry a lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=786)|
| 0:13:12| that people will be living there, paying rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| availing themselves of the social services that are on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| But those social services are the very things that will make it possible for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| to move onward and outward with their life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| We have experience at VMC with this kind of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| both in the Jackson Apartments, which we own and operate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| and with the numerous people that we have placed in permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=814)|
| 0:13:39| in various other parts of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Our success rate is 84%, which is well within the national average of 80% to 85%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=822)|
| 0:13:49| What I want to share with you is that it is not just 57 individuals that we are concerned with here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=829)|
| 0:13:57| It is the 57 people who will start out at MinnVilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Some of them will move on, out into the community, into a better life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| into a productive life elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| They will be replaced by others who need the heavy kind of social support offered there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| And in turn, some of those will move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| So over the years, it is far more than 57 individuals who will be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| and whose lives will be transformed in a permanent solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| These are folks who will no longer be homeless but, in fact, will be neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| I just wanted to make those points, and I thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| Next is Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=876)|
| 0:14:48| I'm Kim Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I don't know if we still do the addresses, 112 South Gay Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=890)|
| 0:14:55| I sent out an e-mail earlier this afternoon to members of council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| and I'll read that real quick and then talk about the larger point of why Knox Heritage is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| about some of the buildings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| We are writing in support of the proposed Neighborhood Stabilization Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and believe it is an important part of reaching the City of Knoxville's goal of improving low-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| to moderate-income neighborhoods and providing assistance to low- to moderate-income citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Funding for the projects in the plan will advance ongoing efforts to increase neighborhood stability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| rehabilitate blighted and vacant properties, increase homeownership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| and assist the homeless in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| In addition, several of the projects included in the plan will preserve historic resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| in the center city and allow them to contribute to the stabilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| and long-term redevelopment of the city's historic neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| These historic resources represent a capital investment that should be preserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| while providing affordable housing opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| and serving as architectural anchors for ongoing redevelopment efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| The City of Knoxville's funding for these projects will leverage equity investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| and federal funding that will make them good long-term investments for taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| and the neighborhoods where they are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Knox Heritage is committed to assisting in any way we can with the implementation of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| targeting historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| We are available to provide information on financial incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| and share our experience in preservation-based development and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| We will do everything possible to assist the nonprofit organizations identified in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| so their projects will be successful and preserve Knoxville's history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| in the neighborhoods across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| And often when you see me here, we're talking about the toughest projects out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| projects that we believe are important in the communities where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| whether it be Menvilla or Eastport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| These are projects that are in the heart of communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| They're historic buildings that give character and stability to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| And I think, especially in the case of Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| that it is a beachhead and a corner location that could be a great beacon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| to the neighborhoods to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| And I think that after years of trying to find a private developer to dive into that market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| and take that project on, that that is an unrealistic expectation at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| And I think that what we do at Knox Heritage is look at the longer term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| I live in the 100 block of Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| And I think 15 years ago there were probably people in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| who wanted to tear down several buildings on that block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| because they were empty and they were an eyesore and they were a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| And now we can see that they are big contributors to the city's tax base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| and to the investment going on downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| So I think when it comes to historic buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| often we need to take the longer view and not look at the current use as the permanent use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| With the low-income housing tax credits, there's a 15-year recapture period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| At the end of that period, buildings are opened up again for market rate or other housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| That may or may not happen in the case of the buildings we're talking about tonight in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| But what this can do is help save historic structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| They are the anchors and communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| And then keep those buildings alive for future investment and future redevelopment that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| I think the efforts in downtown north are going to come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| You can already see it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| And I think the historic structures in that area deserve a chance to be a part of that renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| and, in several cases, can actually be the anchor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| and the impetus for further investment for people in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Commissioner Harmon, why don't you come next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| You're kind of the swing person, so we'll put you in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| and then we'll go to the three who signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| I can't help being short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| I'm Knox County Commissioner District 2, very close to many of these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1111)|
| 0:18:36| Of course, I want to speak first and say that the Neighborhood Stabilization Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| I see no problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| I think overall it's a good thing and it reflects a lot of serious and thoughtful work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| The Minn Villa is the one thing that's causing great concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| And what I want to stress to all of you is to just do your homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| Between now and when we gather as a group, both city council and county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| look into the legal matters, look into the planning matters, look into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| because I am quite persuaded after having looked through a lot of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| that it is quite possible to create a plan with a radius amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| or a perimeter amendment or some other contractual obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| that persons who get Minn Villa or take money for the Minn Villa project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| will not be creating a mission district by further developments in the same area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1166)|
| 0:19:33| We know from research that the best way to approach a housing problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| is to not cluster all in one neighborhood a homeless solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1181)|
| 0:19:43| And we get a lot of words about this, but what we need are words on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| What we need are commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| If we can find a way to get a legal commitment that those who take money for these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| will get their good work out into many neighborhoods, accessible neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| neighborhoods that can handle this material just as well as our neighborhoods can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| then we will all be better served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| So I suppose my point is really do your homework, do your legal work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| I am quite persuaded from much, much looking into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| that it is both administratively and legally possible to do the right thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| by spacing better and making sure that these resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and these obligations to our community are shared more equally geographically around our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Joe Minnicello, I might have messed that up, but Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| Minnicello, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you very much for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| My name is Joe Minnicello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1242)|
| 0:20:44| I live at 311 Lindy Drive in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| I'm generally in support of the Neighborhood Stabilization Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| I've had encounters with Mr. Lawler a couple of times previous to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| and my concern is with his and Ms. Witherspoon's program for supposedly ending the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1257)|
| 0:21:06| If you notice, she said there was a permanent solution to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| I maintain that we have been dealing with homelessness since Adam and Eve were kicked out of the Garden of Eden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| There were homeless people around the walls in Athens and Jerusalem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| and I don't think people who say there is a permanent solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| they're either naive or they don't understand what they're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| I would like to see, as part of a neighborhood stabilization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| to perhaps make the housing projects that Knox County is supporting a lot safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| and try and stop the drug dealing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| I don't think you improve a neighborhood or stabilize a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| by putting 55 units of chronic homeless, as Mr. Lawler wanted to do with the Flanagan School Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| or 15 units on Baker Avenue into a neighborhood that's on the tipping point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| That can go either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| You're talking about people who are moderate to low income, who are trying to hold on to their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| According to their Bible, the Dr. Noe School of Social Work from UT on the problem of homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| 48% of the people are not from Knoxville or Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1338)|
| 0:22:24| 68% of the chronic homeless that they're talking about have addictions to alcohol, drugs, or severe mental problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1344)|
| 0:22:34| We are talking about someone like the gentleman who crushed the skull of the waitress at Bailey's with a rock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1354)|
| 0:22:42| because he heard voices coming from his shower drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| or the gentleman who shot the customer at the restaurant on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| He was also chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| We have to deal with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| The dictum in the gospel at the church I went to Sunday was from Matthew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| where we do have to feed the hungry and shelter the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| My concern is that homelessness in Knox County and Knoxville has become an industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1388)|
| 0:23:15| and it has its industry leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| and it seems to have an unlimited budget without a metric for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| I don't know where Ms. Witherspoon got her 80% success rate from the apartments that she's tending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1404)|
| 0:23:31| but I would hope every one of you would ask her to show you how she gets to that figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| Could we please have a cap on the number of homelessness we agree to serve in Knoxville and Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1419)|
| 0:23:48| Could we then have the people who don't live here not be supported by my tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1428)|
| 0:23:55| and the tax dollars of my neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| And could we then perhaps urge the church-based organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| which Dr. Kim from the Free Clinic of America on Chapman Highway says number almost 1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| to help us in return for their tax-exempt status| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| and not institutionalize the homelessness problem and make it another fixture of big government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1454)|
| 0:24:25| Basically, I just wish that you would each go to the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| where these projects are supposed to be put and see for yourself that unless we have a better social program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1470)|
| 0:24:40| with 24-hour social workers and medical facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| this is like putting anthrax in a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| and it's not going to help the neighborhoods and it's not going to stabilize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| Unlike the county commissioner, I am for a mission project where all the services are connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1495)|
| 0:25:01| and where all the people who need help are centralized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| It seems much easier to me to manage that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| And thank you for your time, and I hope you all have a nice Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| David Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| My name is David Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| I live at 124 East Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Actually, my take on this is probably much closer to Commissioner Harmon's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| But my concern has to do with, one, accountability, two, transparency, and three, public oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1530)|
| 0:25:40| In 2007, through the help of Councilman Rob Frost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| I tried to find out when the 10-year plan meetings were and if they were open to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| At that time, Morris Kaiser was the city attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| He was kind enough to respond to me and told me that the way that the 10-year plan was set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| they weren't required to have open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| They weren't required to post the minutes anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| They weren't required to take public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Now, I spent four years on the CAT Community Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| and now I also sit on the Transportation and Mobility Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| Both of those are advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1579)|
| 0:26:21| The people on there, if I grouped all those people together in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| we would still not have the authority to legislate a paperclip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| But we've got an organization which gets $200,000 a year from the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1591)|
| 0:26:38| has an office on the fifth floor of this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| and yet its meetings are not open to the public, meeting minutes aren't available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| and there's really no transparency to it, at least from where I'm sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1607)|
| 0:26:55| And that's a big concern of mine, particularly since we sat in here in 2006 in much the same situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1615)|
| 0:27:04| where we had to get approval, we couldn't ask for continuance to discuss this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| and $500,000 was approved for Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| And at that time, we were all led to believe that would be the sum total that would be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| Now we're two years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| The price tag is not for contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| Public contribution is not 1.63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| If I read the chart correctly here, there's $250,000, page 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| asked for from the county and another $250,000 asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| It says HUD SHP, which I'm also assuming is public tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| So that brings the total public contribution to close to $2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| In other words, we have something that now is costing taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| over four times the amount of money originally approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| and yet there's still no transparency oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| I work for a big company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| and we routinely, in doing research and development for new products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| spend $2 million, $3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| before we begin to see a dime come back in for the product that we put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| And there's no guarantee it will make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| But we have in that a whole series of gates that a project must travel through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1695)|
| 0:28:24| and at each step acquire approval before it can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| Now we're here at the last minute asking for funds for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| and I've not seen any gates really put forth on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| I'm not really seeing any accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| It's not that I'm against this, and there may be real legitimate reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| But, you know, the 10-year plan also specifically says in there that there should be people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1726)|
| 0:28:52| from the neighborhoods and from the businesses in the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| where the homeless facilities are on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| The best I can find is there's nobody from Old North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| Fourth and Gill, Mechanicsville, Oakwood-Lincoln Park, sitting on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1744)|
| 0:29:11| Why isn't that the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| The 10-year plan says that should be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| which also says that there should be neighborhood involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| The neighborhoods and communities should be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Well, to me, that means open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| I mean, the two advisory committees I've sat on, we're required to have open meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| You know, we're required to post the meeting minutes so that people can take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| As a chair of a subcommittee, I'm even required for the Transportation and Mobility Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1776)|
| 0:29:43| I'm required to set up my meetings at least five days in advance so they can be posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1783)|
| 0:29:48| so anybody who's interested can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| And the best that my subcommittee can do is make recommendations to the full committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| which the full committee then votes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| And even then, it's not law, it's not resolution, it's not anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| So why should these two advisory committees, granted they have members of this panel on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| and I can understand legally why, but they have no financial control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| They have no legislative control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| They have no judicial control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| About 30 more seconds, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| But we've got something here that's asking for a total of $2.2 million as part of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| and yet they're not required to have public meetings and accept public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| You know, I think the structure needs to be dealt with and then get back to funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| I'm not against this per se, but what I am for is more accountability, which I see very lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Patty Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1851)|
| 0:31:01| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| My name's Patty Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| I live at 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| I guess I'm really the only one that's solidly against this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| I do not believe that this is a plan for neighborhood stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| The neighborhood I live in has an awful lot of rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| It has more rental versus home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| To me, a plan for neighborhood stabilization should state that the objective is to have home ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1884)|
| 0:31:35| because that's what truly stabilizes a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| When you have high ratios of rental to home ownership, it's not a stabilized neighborhood in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1899)|
| 0:31:48| There's always transiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| And I'm sure you've heard all of this here before, and it goes on and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| I've been saying this for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| It's only oriented in certain areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| We have a waterfront plan that will hopefully someday come to fruition so that the people that have struggled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1922)|
| 0:32:11| and worked hard to try and keep their properties up and try and help the neighborhood will eventually benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1931)|
| 0:32:23| by having a place that they really can live in and feel safe in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| Right now, we see so much going on within our neighborhoods that is drug-related, crime-related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| We put up already with apartments that were supposed to have been managed, that were supposed to be condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1954)|
| 0:32:45| Well, they were condemned a couple of times for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| We have been through all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| So, to me, this is not a plan for stabilization of the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| It doesn't go throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| It's not, to me, fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| It's actually discrimination against the homeowners that already live in these areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| and have been struggling for years to bring up their areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| We do not need chronic homeless places that have only got a property management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| and perhaps a case worker once a week coming in to check on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| What we need to do is I agree with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| I mean, I agree with the Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| I agree with the housing, building houses for home ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| That's what's called stabilizing older neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| And we do have a lot of old structures in our neighborhood that we would like to see saved also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| Some of them are from the turn of the century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| So that, to me, puts them on a historic basis because we've lost so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| We have an unusual area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| We have a chance at good positive things coming from the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| We don't need more, I don't know if I should be saying the names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| but places like Spanish Trace and stuff like that where we have so many rentals that have crime problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2054)|
| 0:34:24| Anyways, I really don't see this plan with Old Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| I mean, it's only got a couple of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Some of them are going to South Haven, Woodlawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| They're talking about East Redbud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| And those aren't even within the empowerment zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| And over the years we had high hopes for the EZ, and the EZ really didn't pan out either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2080)|
| 0:34:47| I mean, that was supposed to help stabilize and do stuff for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| Anyways, I had sent an e-mail this morning very early, and I guess I want to put it on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| I don't know if it's in the packet that was handed out since I haven't seen a recent one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| so I guess I need to turn this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| And that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Mayor, what's the thinking around not having open meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| I actually can't answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| John or somebody, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| I'd be glad to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| I'm John Lawler, director of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| I'm not sure what the thinking of Morris Kaiser was when he communicated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| The reality is we are more than happy to have those meetings open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| We meet quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Our next meeting will be the 19th of December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| And at that meeting we've invited anyone, council members, anyone that would like to be there in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2145)|
| 0:35:54| So if we need to go through a new format to make that an open meeting, that's something we're more than happy to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| My interest is as many people that want to come, the better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| because that's that many more people that understand how intentional we are about our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| and the accountability that we interject into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And who is on the advisory committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Are there neighborhoods involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| Right now there are no neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Commissioner Amy Broyles brought that to my attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| because in the back of the 10-year plan you see several recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| When it comes to the structure of the advisory board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| one of those recommendations is neighborhood representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| And quite honestly, Commissioner Broyles brought that to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| And so immediately we started working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| And last Thursday, which was the 20th of November, I met with Ed Eckenrod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| who is the rising president of COIN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| My request to him during that meeting, I think I made the request three or four times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| because I knew how important it was to Commissioner Broyles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| was find me two members from COIN that you would recommend to be on the advisory board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2217)|
| 0:37:03| COIN meets this next Monday, December 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| and at that meeting I'm going to attend and he's going to have that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| So we see that as valuable, again, and important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| and we've tried to work in response to what Commissioner Broyles requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| The eighth strategy among the nine, the first being move people into housing first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| but the eighth one is to make clear that this is a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| And you spoke very eloquently about shifting the culture at the old Oakwood-Lincoln Park Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2250)|
| 0:37:39| And so in order to shift the culture, we need to include people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| Right, right, and we are more than happy to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| because we do believe if we're going to accomplish our goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| it must be a community effort that works with us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Are we as engaged with all other eight strategies as we are with the first one, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2275)|
| 0:38:02| Yeah, we, again, responding to something that was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| I present at the quarterly meetings a status report on the goals we have every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| as a 10-year plan as it relates to those strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| So all of those strategies are included in our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| Those reports are in the process of going up on our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2302)|
| 0:38:28| Our website is changing servers right now, and so Robert is saying by tomorrow he can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| That's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| He characterized my reports as boggy and unfit for posting on the website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| They're really detailed, and I think they're very interesting and helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| So we are going to post those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| and then we're going to allow him also to kind of do a little executive summary on each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| for those that aren't interested in boggy material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Thanks, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Let's see, Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| This is for Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I'd just like to make a formal request while we're in public session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| that the next meeting of the 10-year plan be sunshine through Ms. Mitchell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| so that all the council members could attend if they would so desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| and get that out on the city website so that it's available for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| and the location is announced and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| That's December the 19th at 8 o'clock at the Public Defender's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| and we would love to have you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| That's 8 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| 8 a.m., not p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| We don't do p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| We work nights around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| I have a follow-up question for Ms. Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| One of the folks that spoke, Ms. Barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| talked about the Neighborhood Stabilization Plan that came out of Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| was monies to stabilize neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Obviously there's been a lot of foreclosures across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| and she was concerned that our usage of the funds here in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| don't seem to stabilize neighborhoods in the way that she's thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Can you talk with council about how these specific priorities were arrived at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| and how they dovetail and maybe leverage the kinds of efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| that community development already had in place through our HUD monies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| In other words, how do these priorities that you have recommended to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| stabilize neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| First of all, the projects that we proposed are all eligible uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2418)|
| 0:40:23| under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which Congress passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| and then HUD had to develop the regulations for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| Specifically in terms of the issues of rental housing in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| for Ms. Barrier, this is the KHP project that she's talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| in terms of where KHP will buy five houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Their goal is to sell those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| but HUD recognized that given the market right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| that a lot of houses can't be sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| So even if they purchase them and rehab them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| the market is such that they may not be able to sell them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| And so HUD actually encourages to rent them temporarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| until the market picks up and you can sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| We share Ms. Barrier's concerns about the impact of landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| who have houses and they don't keep them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| and they're not concerned about the tenants in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2486)|
| 0:41:29| KHP, on the other hand, has experience in managing rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| and we think that they do a good job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| And this is five houses spread throughout those neighborhoods in south Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| and we believe that they will be very concerned, as Ms. Barrier is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| with the impact on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| And as I said, their intention when the market picks up is to sell those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| So we actually have with Habitat and KHP, those would be for resale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2514)|
| 0:42:02| Again, do you want me to go through each of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| Yeah, I guess I'd like to hear a focus on how we're leveraging this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2526)|
| 0:42:13| to stabilize neighborhoods and the kinds of concerns that Ms. Barrier addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| Well, with Habitat for Humanity, we're all familiar, I think, with their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| This would help them acquire and rehab actually four properties in the revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2542)|
| 0:42:29| As you know, when they actually purchase homes and they rehab or build homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2549)|
| 0:42:36| they already have a financing mechanism for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| They have a family that's going to move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| We have examples of where Habitat has been successful throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| We think that this will be a stabilizing impact on otherwise foreclosed homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2567)|
| 0:42:57| which are destabilizing neighborhoods right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| So one of the keys on both the first and second, and third actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| the first three projects are to take houses that have been foreclosed upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| or are abandoned and actually stop the destabilizing effect by going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| and purchasing them, rehabbing them, and then selling them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| or temporarily renting them if necessary until the market picks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| In the case of the fourth activity, which is KCDC Eastport School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| Mr. Nance is here from KCDC and he can expand upon this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| but we all know that one of the issues that has been destabilizing the Five Points area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| where we have a lot of individual citizens, our nonprofit partners, and the city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| a lot of these entities have invested in Five Points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| but the current situation at Walter P. Taylor Homes is a destabilizing effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| And so one of the goals, and this is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| how we are building on strategies that have been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2638)|
| 0:44:01| We've been talking for some time with KCDC about their desires to revitalize Walter P. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| One piece of that are the duplexes that this council has previously funded for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| to build duplexes for senior citizens to move some folks out of Walter P. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| In addition, Eastport School would rehab a vacant blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| for 25 units of low-income elderly housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| These would be seniors who would, again, move out of Walter P.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2670)|
| 0:44:33| It would help them to begin reducing the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| and then they have plans to further redevelop that property, which Mr. Nance can talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| So we think this will help protect the investments that are around that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| With the permanent support of housing, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| the issue of homelessness is destabilizing to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| and there's a lot of debate on the right strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| And I know good friends in this community disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| I see good friends out there on both sides of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| We disagree on how to do it, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| But I'm real excited about finally getting the funding together for Menvella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| but also activity number six, which is the development of the permanent support of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2714)|
| 0:45:21| for a location to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| What I stated last week, and I want to state again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| is these funds are specifically to find property where permanent support of housing can be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| that is outside of the areas of concentration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| It addresses Commissioner Harmon's concerns and some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2739)|
| 0:45:43| And so we're very excited that we can put this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| I'm hoping that additional state funds come so we can put at least the full $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| In addition, we have home funds and some other funds that could probably help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| when these locations, a location or multiple locations, are found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| Again, this is to get it out of where the concentration is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| So we think this is a strong piece of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| The demolitions activity number seven, those will be used strategically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| It's hard to estimate how many properties can be demolished with that amount of money, with the $180,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| It depends on whether it's small residential areas or larger commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| But we know you all are very familiar with the blighted properties that are in these neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2783)|
| 0:46:30| and so we will do some strategic demolishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| This will be over and above what the city is able to do in the normal budget year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| So I hope that answers your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| We think that with each of these projects, they will add to actually stabilizing neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2800)|
| 0:46:47| That is the intent of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| First, I'm glad to hear that the meetings that Mr. Booker referred to are now open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2812)|
| 0:46:58| And I'm also sad to hear that they're just now getting open because, like he accurately depicted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| I went round and round with a number of people a long time ago trying to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| even the time of day when these would meet, let alone who was on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| and who would, you know, if any minute meetings or even an agenda was available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| So that's a good change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Unfortunately, it's been a while coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Second, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| I guess this is for Mrs. Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| The, you know, we're spending, we're putting money into the development item number six, supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2855)|
| 0:47:45| And, you know, we're probably going to be able to do more with less there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2865)|
| 0:47:54| as opposed to number five, which is Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| I mean, is spending approximately $200 a square foot something we should be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2879)|
| 0:48:07| when they're less expensive alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Well, I think I would defer to John Lawler to talk about the strategy of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2890)|
| 0:48:17| This is an historic property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| You know, we've heard all the arguments for and against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| The second one, the permanent supportive housing, certainly if there is new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2903)|
| 0:48:32| it would tend to be less per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| And it's not clear on number six yet whether, in fact, this would be brand new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2917)|
| 0:48:44| or if it would be, you know, rehabbing an existing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| All that is yet to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Let me maybe, John, if you want to get in, but let me maybe comment on that real quick, if I might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| Two things that we probably need to be clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| The amount of money being designated toward the Menvilla is not a pot of money that's sitting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| that if it doesn't go there, it goes somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| That is a large part of it is part of this development situation itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2945)|
| 0:49:12| Everything from there's a developer fee of $850,000 that's being waived on this deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| to the historic tax credits that are part of this to the federal home loan bank money, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| So if we don't do Menvilla, it's not like, oh, well, here's $7 million that we can go put somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| So we need to be real clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| This is particularly specific to this location, and everybody needs to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| I think the second thing when you're looking at square foot costs is this isn't like we're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2975)|
| 0:49:40| adding on or remodeling our own house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| These are units that we're turning into efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| So you're putting bathrooms and kitchens in each one, which by its very nature is going to make it more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| But, John, you might comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| Yeah, I am not the straight man for the mayor, but we had a conversation about this very thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| and I put together a quick little spreadsheet like I did at the last meeting to show that when you look at the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| sources for Menvilla, 80% of those funding sources are specific to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| So they've either been spent already, 460,000 of CDBG funds have already been spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| or they're funds that only can be used on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| So when we talk about a $7 million project budget, 80% of that is specific to the project and it's not portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| We can't take it to some other idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| The other point that needs to be made is the reality is historic rehabs for permanent supportive housing are wildly expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3037)|
| 0:50:45| Is this the primary methodology that our development partner will use to develop the units we need to develop for the senior plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3045)|
| 0:50:55| Absolutely not, because it is expensive and it takes a lot more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3055)|
| 0:51:01| If you remember the length of time the developer went through just to get the National Park Service to give him what he needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| to get the historic tax credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| So it takes more time and it takes more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| We asked the Corporation for Supportive Housing to give us examples of different price per unit on 13 different projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3073)|
| 0:51:21| and they ranged from $90,000 at the low end to in excess of $300,000 permanent supportive housing using historic tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3081)|
| 0:51:31| So $120,000, though it's a lot, it is not excessive when you think about projects like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3091)|
| 0:51:41| But what I'm hearing a little bit conflicts a little bit with what Madeline said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| that in her introductory remarks this plan still has to be approved by HUD, correct, and that there can be amendments, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3107)|
| 0:51:56| So what I'm wondering is, is there some alternative to, you know, we just passed on Tuesday of last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3116)|
| 0:52:08| an additional two years on top of one year to get this project done when we have properties available for sale right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3128)|
| 0:52:23| So I guess those are my issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| Those are, but we don't have the funding for other properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| We do have a funding specific to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| But I'm saying we talked about earlier how things can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Remember, this is just what we're talking about here to go toward Minville is just a small piece of the overall cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| Most of the brunt of that is in funding sources totally separate from what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| So this can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| You're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| But it's not like we can take all the rest of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| This money can be applied somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| You're 100% right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| The bulk of it, though, the 80% of it is, like John said, is specific to the Minville deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| Does that answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| It helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| I think Councilman Holquist is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Then I'll come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| Ms. Rojero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| I sent you an article or linked to an article from a planning publication about the Neighborhood Stabilization Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3200)|
| 0:53:29| and the author's concerns about how we were throwing more money the same way we had thrown money year after year at the same places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3209)|
| 0:53:39| marginalized areas, marginalized properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| And as a result, he was not anticipating seeing any real benefit or impact from the NSP dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| because we were sort of doing the same thing we've been doing for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Did you have a chance to read that by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| Actually, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| It's there for me to read over the holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| We've been working on developing this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| But it is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| And in looking at this, it's kind of a mixed bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| It looks like they were trying to do some things differently, which I think I find some encouragement in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| And we're also doing some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| Of course, one of the concerns you're hearing again and again is Minville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| but I think overall, from stepping back a step and looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| here's an opportunity to do some things differently because these funds aren't necessarily tied to any one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| They do have to fit certain criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| But are we really being creative or are we really getting the impact that we need by trying to do things differently from the way we have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3276)|
| 0:54:45| Well, first of all, I'm sorry I didn't have a chance to read that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Based on what you said, let me just respond in this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| First of all, we're working within the regulations from this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| And I think within those regulations that we've come up with some good options here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| Infill housing for Habitat for Humanity, I think that's a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| These are taking, as I said earlier, foreclosed properties, rehabbing them, and putting families in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| We're talking about four properties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| This isn't a lot of money for many of these projects, but we're talking four properties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| For KHP, again, in an otherwise stable neighborhood that can be threatened by foreclosures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3324)|
| 0:55:31| they will be able to purchase five homes, rehab them, sell them, or temporarily rent them until the market picks back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3331)|
| 0:55:41| HOPE VI, this is a very important project for KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| A lot of money, taxpayer dollars, federal dollars, and others, went to the HOPE VI development in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| It's a wonderful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| These eight foreclosures have KCDC very concerned in the risk of, I believe there's five others that are risking foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3354)|
| 0:56:01| Now, this will help counteract the threat of destabilization in HOPE VI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3361)|
| 0:56:11| With Eastport School, again, Walter P. Taylor destabilizes the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3371)|
| 0:56:18| This is a plan that's been on the books, so I consider this NSP money to be very good timing for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3378)|
| 0:56:27| in a way to move up this project previously than KCDC had anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3387)|
| 0:56:34| The development of the permanent supportive housing outside of where we currently have a concentration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| again, these are new dollars that will allow us to move that forward when we had not previously anticipated doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| Demolitions, how can you argue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| We have demolitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| We need a lot of where there is an order for demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| We are able to now put some more dollars towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| That helps stabilize neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3418)|
| 0:57:00| So, without having read the article, I don't understand the person's point, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3420)|
| 0:57:07| because I see all of these as benefits to us and our work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| Again, it won't solve all the problems because there's not enough money here to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3431)|
| 0:57:17| But it does move us towards the set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| We try to not jump ahead and do something really different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3439)|
| 0:57:24| just chasing dollars to do something that we're not competent to do or have the experience, nor do our partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| These are all activities that make sense for us, builds upon our competencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| and the issues in our community right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| That's a helpful answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| I had a second question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| Well, I'll hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| I'll let it go to the other council members and come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3469)|
| 0:57:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| Councilwoman Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Well, actually, my light went on so long ago that many people have been very helpful in making some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3472)|
| 0:57:59| that I won't need to make and some observations I won't need to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| and particularly I appreciate the mayor answering some questions that were in my mind as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| But, you know, I will make one comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| which really doesn't go to neighborhood stabilization in the same vein that I think Ms. Berrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| and some other people have referred to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| But I do want to comment on just a historical perspective here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| of having tried to be involved as a council and as an individual with this war on homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3507)|
| 0:58:37| because I feel like it is a major battle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| and have been somewhat closely involved with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3521)|
| 0:58:46| and closely concerned about this area of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| which seemed to be so plagued, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| by some of the issues that homelessness brings to a city or to a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3533)|
| 0:59:00| And, you know, there's been much done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| There have been many dollars spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| And there's been a tremendous vision for how we are going to take this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| which seemed to be so concentrated and seemed to be so specifically identified with the homeless issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3553)|
| 0:59:21| and work with not just one property, but an entire corridor there on Broadway and North Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3561)|
| 0:59:31| And I have been so excited to see the broader vision of trying to rehab Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3571)|
| 0:59:38| It's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| It's just amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| And I think Ms. Trent referred to the fact that she's now a part of the neighborhood there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3581)|
| 0:59:49| And she and many people have found that to be a wonderful place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3589)|
| 0:59:54| I'm looking at all of the plans for North Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| and the things that have been done, the facade improvements there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| the investment that we've made there to try to mitigate, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| some of the issues that we all know the homeless bring to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| VMC has just almost completed, I believe, their building there, which is just absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3611)|
| 1:00:20| I never knew if that could ever happen because of how many people had to be involved to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3620)|
| 1:00:28| And that means that that end of North Gay is going to be open for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| and rehabilitation and better uses than we have put that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| I think of Jackson there, where I've spent so many mornings and so many days working with the homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| And someone spoke about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| We are dealing with folks that just have enormous issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| It's not an overnight fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| I think the 80% number that Ms. Weatherstone gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3659)|
| 1:01:05| I can almost believe that because I have seen so many successes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| and personal lives that have been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| But I'm particularly, in looking at what's before us tonight, we have to go back to Mantevilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3673)|
| 1:01:22| That has been, since before I came on to council, just a terribly blighted situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3682)|
| 1:01:33| We've tried many ways to get private developers interested in that because of its historic nature and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| But simply because of the very issues that we've discussed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| it simply isn't something that anybody gets really excited about investing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| This council decided some years ago to become invested there and to change that blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| And to me, it changes the whole nature of the residential neighborhoods that are close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3717)|
| 1:02:05| To me, it changes the whole nature of bringing viable businesses back into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| Somehow we've just got to clean up that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| You remember what was there on the corner across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| It's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| That very unpleasant toy store is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| And we've done a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| But to me, it seems that we just must find a way to have Mantevilla once again restored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3751)|
| 1:02:39| so that we can entice other people to become a part of that area and that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3759)|
| 1:02:47| So, you know, there have been a lot of important reports and important numbers given out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3767)|
| 1:02:53| But a vision for Knoxville, a vision for the people who live in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| who come from Forth and Gillow, come from Lincoln Park and Oakwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| it's just so important to me that they can enter Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| without having to pass through this still needy area, still very blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3786)|
| 1:03:15| So I know that's maybe a very small part of it, but to me that's a huge part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3795)|
| 1:03:21| And I think it would be such an enormous psychological boost to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| in an area where we just have not been able to find the solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| And to me, finding a way to restore Mantevilla as we have already invested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| and to invest in that area of our city is just very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| So for that reason, I just wanted to make those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| And thank you for that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Mr. Lawler, and I apologize if I missed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| but earlier I think maybe Council Member Woodhull,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| if I'm attributing the question to the wrong Council Member, I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| asked about the members of your committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| And I know you said there were no neighborhoods on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| but I didn't hear who is a member of the committee that meets at the Public Defender's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| or what entities are represented on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| Andy Black from Helen Ross McNabb, Lawrence Tolick from the Cornerstone Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| Major Don Vick, who is the head of the Salvation Army,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| Ginny Weatherstone, who is head of VMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Father Reagan, who leads Catholic Charities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| and does a bunch of other items in the community related to homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| David Roush from KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| I'm going around the table right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| Roger Noe agreed to step on to the Advisory Board once he stepped out of the position I'm currently serving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3880)|
| 1:04:47| Alvin Nance is on the Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3887)|
| 1:04:52| John Gill is on the Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| Bo Schaefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| How can I forget Bo Schaefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| He's on the Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| So I probably have left out someone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| Oh, yeah, Mintha Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| And, of course, the Chairman of the Advisory Board is Frank Rothermel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Is Mr. Rosen from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Yeah, Bert Rosen is also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| Why do you guys meet at the Public Defender's Office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| Probably because Dr. Noe operates out of there, and that's where they originally started meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| They have a great meeting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| It's a gem that they turn in a meeting room and make that readily available to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3932)|
| 1:05:36| But if there is a better place for us to meet, we'd be more than happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| I think when Dr. Noe was the Director, he was also part-time on staff there, and I think that's why it started there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Most people don't know where the Public Defender's Office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| It's actually a very nice facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| It's a terrific facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| I didn't know anything about it, fortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| It's actually in my district, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| All these issues, you see, they're coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Everything comes back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| You see where I'm going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Good, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| All roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| Actually, there was a comment made earlier from Commissioner Harmon, who was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| that I had spoke to at the last council meeting regarding issues about radius, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| and then hopefully when we have further discussions, we can further define.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| So I agree with his concern about if we can figure out ways to spread out any services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| especially housing services we provide, that's the best way to do this, and I agree wholeheartedly with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| I think that when we gather and have those kinds of discussions, I'm looking for a, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=3990)|
| 1:06:40| a larger definition than radius of two miles or whatever, because here's one of the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4000)|
| 1:06:46| I'll just use my district as an example because I represent it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| The 6th District is boarded by every district in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| We're right in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| Technically, you could put around the periphery of the 6th District all of these particular permanent housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4015)|
| 1:07:01| supportive housing issues, and then do a radius plan and not be in other districts and be really all in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| While that's a great idea that we need to visit, I'm very concerned about when you deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4028)|
| 1:07:14| We also have to deal with the issue of also what's located in individual districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| Also, with regards to, and I think it's on page 17, and you don't have it in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| but I want to have someone define for me access to public transportation as you're dealing with the issue of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| permanent supportive housing, and I don't know if Director O'Hara can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| And the reason I ask that is if you pull up the CAT map and you can just look at that very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4056)|
| 1:07:41| and determine when you start talking about access to public transportation, once again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4061)|
| 1:07:45| you're definitionally putting it back in my district, Councilman Becker's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| Councilman Holquist's district, and the poor areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Now, that's what CAT serves, but when we do that definition, you know, there are certain areas of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| not districts, but certain areas of the city, that large geographic areas of the city that CAT doesn't touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| Now, it does run out to Farragut, and it's got to run the halls, and it runs up through north and south a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4084)|
| 1:08:10| It merges, but there are large chunks of this community that are not touched at all by public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| So, definitionally, they would be excluded, which then closes the area with regards to what you'd be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4096)|
| 1:08:25| doing a permanent supportive housing piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| And the reason I bring that up is I think that should be a real important part of this discussion on how do we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4108)|
| 1:08:34| access to transportation, which homeless individuals need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| and not definitionally limited to a certain geographic area to provide these kinds of housing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4117)|
| 1:08:46| I also bring that up because the request of Council was to approve Exhibit A and Exhibit B with the understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4126)|
| 1:08:55| if the THDA allocation comes through, we don't have to come back, and this is one that's not for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| We don't have to come back to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| I hesitate a little because that makes great sense for me to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| but the reason I hesitate is 40% of the funding that's going to go into the permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| which I'm going to have some concerns about with regards to the definition I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| would automatically get put back in, you know, and without me having a clear understanding on how we're going to locate those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4155)|
| 1:09:21| where we're going to locate those, how this definition of access to public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| how we're going to deal with the radius agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| So I want to have those kinds of discussions and not, you know, let the THDA funding flow in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4167)|
| 1:09:32| and the plan gets implemented and, you know, I look up in June or July of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| or as I'm heading out the door and everything's situated in or around my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| So I don't know, Director O'Hara, how I deal and get comfortable with doing what I guess with regards to process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4182)|
| 1:09:51| and timing makes great sense, improving both of those now so you guys can move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| but puts me in a very precarious position with regards to what is going to be the outcome of the permanent supportive housing piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| and some of the others with regards to placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| And am I rubber-staffing just placements that are going to ultimately end up a lot in my district or even,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| I don't want to speak for other council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| but I think some of the other council members who have districts that have low-income areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| large pockets of them that could have these types of housing put in them that may not need any more rental housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| I think there was a comment earlier about the issue of rental housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| and I think that was a very good, valid point, and that's why I was glad you mentioned the thrust that you've got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| because a lot of these things are taking folks from the rental property, and I agree wholeheartedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| One of the problems in my district that I've seen is that it's not that you don't have good neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4237)|
| 1:10:43| It's not that Five Points and Mechanicsville and Lonsdale and Fifth Avenue and Woodbine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4243)|
| 1:10:52| and Selma Avenue do not have great housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| The problem is those folks who own those houses, when they move out and move to a nicer house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| they don't turn around and sell it to a young family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| They make it a piece of their retirement and make it a piece of rental property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| and then they rent it to anybody who then comes in and doesn't respect it, doesn't have the ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| So rental becomes a big issue also, and we've got to make sure we disperse that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| So I guess I got on a horse there, and you're ready to answer some of those questions, but that's my struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| I'm glad you told me about the committee because I wanted to know who was on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| I think we need to have neighborhoods on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4281)|
| 1:11:23| And, you know, where you all meet is you all's charge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| but I just thought that was interesting the public defender's office tried to get my hands around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| but it makes sense now logistically from where the beginning of the program started with Dr. Noe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| Vice Mayor Brown, in response to your question about if we go ahead and support the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| which would basically approve both plans, anything for number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| for the development of permanent supportive housing, for the location to be determined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| all of that would have to be publicly vetted, a contract, and there would be public meetings about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| and any proposal would have to come back, just like every one of these, for this council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4319)|
| 1:12:06| So the money will not be spent, could not be spent on anything prior to this council approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4326)|
| 1:12:13| So you're saying for agreement to go ahead and submit and accept the money, but not to go ahead and apply the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| Right, exactly. We would just, if in fact these funds come to us in January, they're allocated to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4338)|
| 1:12:25| we could submit Exhibit B as our amendment showing how we intend to use the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4345)|
| 1:12:32| but again everything would have to be approved by council, each individual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4352)|
| 1:12:37| And there would be, and particularly with number six, since it is not defined now like the other ones are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4357)|
| 1:12:45| it would come through a series of meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| And I hope I didn't ramble on too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| I hope, John, you understand my concerns and Director O'Hara, some of the points I'm making and some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| because, you know, you can look up and these things can be too far down the track to have a positive impact on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| as it relates to location, location, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| And, you know, I think need is, I think we see the need and the plus and benefit of supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4387)|
| 1:13:15| but location, location, location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| And I'd just like to comment that I don't think we can underestimate the importance of the workshop that we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| the meeting we're going to have, the public meeting with the neighborhoods on the 10th and the workshop on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| I think on the 11th we will begin a process where we are going to talk about a lot of tradeoffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| between what kind of sites work, what those sites need as far as attributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| and then at the same time trying to be true to this idea of spreading out the development of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4418)|
| 1:13:47| in every person's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| And maybe there isn't adequate public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| then the development budgets of those plans need to include some form of transportation be provided to the residents there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4432)|
| 1:14:01| in order for us to fulfill the mandate to spread these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| So I think through that process we're going to address the very issues you've got to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| Yeah, because some of the questions I brought up today and I've brought up in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| my hope is that we can have that discussion on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| And hopefully, just as a suggestion, and you know best how to manage your board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| and I didn't hear when Cat had a representative on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| but it might be good to not only add neighborhood but to add Cat on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| because we're dealing with the issue of Cat in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| And as we look at these types of activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| surely someone for Cat should be at the table to chime in not only on accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| but also any cost issues that may come up in the future as it relates to permanent supportive housing and the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4490)|
| 1:14:53| As we were talking about buying foreclosed properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| and rehabbing properties through various organizations, I looked out in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| and I thought, well, there's someone here who deals with these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4503)|
| 1:15:08| rehabbing properties and existing housing stock in our community every day, Jeff Tallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| Jeff, would you mind coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| I'd like to kind of get your take on all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| You may not have anything to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| Actually, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| I was going to call on Jeff next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| He came in and wanted to have a public comment but was in jury duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| and felt like that was a good extenuating circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Jeff, if you would comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| But we would ask everybody else to try to keep it as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4533)|
| 1:15:35| I think he's just asking if you have any comment in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Actually, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| And I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| The fundamental issues of housing in our urban core are issues that I've been preoccupied with for some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4540)|
| 1:15:48| since having served as president of my neighborhood association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| at large member of my ZAC with Empowerment Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4551)|
| 1:15:55| serving on the planning committee with the Empowerment Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| and serving on the board of the Empowerment Zone for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| I represent a responsible private sector player, a lender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4562)|
| 1:16:08| and up to this point I never thought of lending money as a patriotic activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| but in the context of our current circumstances, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4572)|
| 1:16:19| And it's in the spirit of private sector interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| and participation that I've come before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| I had a chance to read the plan as put together by the Department of Community Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4585)|
| 1:16:31| and I don't think there's any question that those are our best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4591)|
| 1:16:35| and brightest players in those respective categories of concern in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| What jumped out at me, though, was maybe an opportunity to create some leveraging of another type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4602)|
| 1:16:50| And let me go back just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| One of my, frankly, frustrations I had with my Empowerment Zone experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| was that we too frequently addressed the supply side of the problem issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4616)|
| 1:17:03| rather than the demand side of the problem issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| And as the late, great management guru Peter Drucker admonished managers, he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4626)|
| 1:17:16| don't fix problems, seize opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| And I think that there is an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| One is that when we talk about the market, and I came in late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| I did hear Ms. Bergero mention something about HUD's definition of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4646)|
| 1:17:31| One of the things that's interesting to me is that there is no one the market in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| There's about 350 markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| And our market's not that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| I mean, we know that Knox County has the lowest unemployment rate in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| And what's interesting in my business, it's a lot of higher end housing is where you've got more softness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| and a lot of time on the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| A lot of our urban housing, as the perception of risk diminishes with living in the urban core,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4674)|
| 1:18:00| as there's greater connection to what living in the city means with a finite supply and with increased demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4680)|
| 1:18:10| Actually, housing in the urban core is not too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| There's plenty of exceptions to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| But I think there's something to build upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4695)|
| 1:18:18| And with that in mind, I would like to possibly make a suggestion to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4698)|
| 1:18:25| And it's specifically here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| I looked at, and I'm not picking on KHP, but I'm just looking at that $750,000 budget for five houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4710)|
| 1:18:37| And I know they're going to do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| And I have great respect and regard for everything that Jackie and the team at KHP does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| However, if we were to be able to turn that $750,000 into individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4724)|
| 1:18:51| and I'm not saying that we should take it from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| but if we were to be able to take $750,000 and turn that into 100 ADDI down payment assistance grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4733)|
| 1:19:00| that would be an opportunity to help maybe energize existing demand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| help create some additional demand, and help renovate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| and help leverage that instead of five houses into 100 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| You double that into a million five and that becomes 200 houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| That's the piece that's missing in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| And I think that with maybe in conjunction with the terrific home buyer education process that, for my money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4767)|
| 1:19:36| KHP is the leader in or one of the leaders in, at the very least, in Knoxville, so that you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| And what's happening is basically there's hardly anything else out there on the mortgage side except for FHA financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4782)|
| 1:19:49| FHA is responsible lending combined with a home buyer education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| That becomes even more safeguard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| so we're not compounding additional folks who are going to be looking at early payment defaults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| and contributing to the problem that we're fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| And as much as we're looking at what I consider to be one-of-a-kind money for one-of-a-kind circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| this to me is maybe one part that's missing from our discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| So that's really all I have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Even though he's left, thank you again, Commissioner Harmon, for researching the two-mile radius issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| I did ask a few weeks ago Mr. Swanson to research that for counsel, and he's been doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4834)|
| 1:20:41| Maybe, you know, hearing what Vice Mayor Brown said about the two-mile radius,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| maybe the issue is more of the empowerment zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| the empowerment, you know, trying to look outside of the empowerment zone for future supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4850)|
| 1:20:58| You know, the neighborhoods in the empowerment zone are in there because they have their own separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4858)|
| 1:21:07| That was identified at the last, when the city was going through the empowerment zone process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| So maybe that is one way to consider the siting of future housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4873)|
| 1:21:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Councilman Holquist, is that a new or an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| It's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| Mr. O'Hara, I want to refer back to Mr. Tolman's question about the possibility of an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4885)|
| 1:21:35| First of all, I want to address what you said earlier about amending this plan, this amended plan, again, if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4895)|
| 1:21:43| If I understood you to say the plan can be amended according,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4903)|
| 1:21:47| as long as it complies with the HUD guidelines and regulations, we can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4907)|
| 1:21:52| If we see something that doesn't work, we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| So is that the only basis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| If we see something is failing, that's the only basis for amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| First of all, what HUD suggested with this plan, because there is such a short deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| they said do the best you can to get a good plan together, submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| If later you see that if you want to change it later, it can be amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4934)|
| 1:22:20| It has to go through a process to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| So that might be because we later see a better use for the funds or a project doesn't move forward as expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4943)|
| 1:22:31| It could be different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| So it's pretty broad, the opportunity to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| What would that process look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Because, again, we all know this is a rushed situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| It's not ideal from anybody's standpoint, not ideal from you and your staff's standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| not ideal from the standpoint of the public and their inability to engage adequately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| and not ideal for this council because we're put in a difficult place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| So what would it look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Are we going to be fairly intentional about looking for amendment opportunities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| Are we just going to kind of move ahead with what we've got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| And then if things don't seem to be working out, I mean, there's sort of a continuum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| And I'm trying to get an idea of how we're going to address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| and the potential for a different approach, perhaps in some case, in amending the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=4999)|
| 1:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| Well, first of all, we think we have a good plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| And so it would be our intention to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| If you all agree and adopt this plan, it would be our intention to move forward with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| so the subrecipients know they can develop their plan for next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| knowing that this source of funding is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| And, you know, so that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| You know, any of these, if we say we're going to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| and then we leave the impression that at any time, willy-nilly, we might decide to change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| then I don't think that's a good way for our department to plan, nor for these subrecipients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| However, in moving forward, as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| if one of the subrecipients found that they just cannot acquire property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| at the 15% average discount that's required, the regulations are too onerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5048)|
| 1:24:17| and it's not going to work out for them to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| then we would come to you with suggestions on how to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| If HUD changes the regulations, which some of these, they might do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5066)|
| 1:24:30| Some of these regulations are getting a lot of pushback from various communities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| If any change in regulation somehow presented an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| or created, again, something even worse for us, then we might want to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| But in general, I think our intention is, I mean, our intention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| and I hope yours is too if you approve this, is to move forward with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| But one never knows if, here's another example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| what if another source of funding came forward that would be a better source for one of these projects than NSP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5101)|
| 1:25:07| with different restrictions, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Then we might suggest to you that we not use NSP funds for one of these activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| and instead use whatever other funds might be presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5116)|
| 1:25:21| So those are the ways we see it being amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Certainly if the state comes back and gives us much less funds than we're anticipating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5124)|
| 1:25:30| or many more funds than we're anticipating, then that would require us to, again, amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| But remember, regardless of this plan, another thing that might cause an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| is if any of these contracts came to you and council did not approve the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| and the funds needed to be reallocated to another project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5151)|
| 1:25:55| depending on the amount of the funds, that might trigger a formal amendment to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5155)|
| 1:26:03| Well, I want to go back to the language you used a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| You said, first of all, it's a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Well, I think overall it probably is a good plan given the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| the difficult constraints that you had on you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| and the folks that work under you had in putting this plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| But we know that it was a rushed plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| and so you did a good job putting together a plan under very arduous conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5185)|
| 1:26:32| and difficult circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| But to say that based on that, that any changes would be willy-nilly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| once we've had much more time to think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| I think I have a little bit of a problem with that choice of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| Given that it's rushed now and it wouldn't be rushed later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| I'm talking about that there would be a reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| I didn't want to leave the impression that we would just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| that for any minor reason, look at opening up the plan again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5221)|
| 1:27:06| A lot of effort has been put in by this council, by the community in reviewing these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| and so we wouldn't approach it lightly is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| We're not going to approach it lightly with you all to bring back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| to put you through this again in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| We believe that this plan, as things stand now, we believe in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Things might change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Again, sources of funding, an individual subrecipient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| finds that it's not practical to carry this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| We're not going to approach it lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| But just like our annual plan can be amended if necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| or as circumstances change, this one can be done as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| That's a good explanation, much better than willy-nilly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| Strike those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| How would a plan be amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| Is it only up to you and your department to initiate an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| or can this council initiate a plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| I would think if it's – well, let me just leave it at that, the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| and let you respond to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5291)|
| 1:28:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| I would have to ask the law department, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| But I believe that this – as a council, you could direct us to amend the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| By resolution, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| By resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| Or we could bring a plan amendment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| But you set the policy for the city, and so our job is to bring these to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| And if we feel that there is an amendment that's necessary, we'll bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5324)|
| 1:28:48| Likewise, if council directs us to do so, we would as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5334)|
| 1:28:55| Well, that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5335)|
| 1:28:56| Let me just suggest something to think about at this point for you, for council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| your staff, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| Since we know we have the NSP funds from HUD directly, we move ahead with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5341)|
| 1:29:09| as you've proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| We don't know for sure about the state yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| So these other client organizations or contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| they don't know that they've got that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| So if and when we find out we have that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| that would be a time to look at proposals perhaps like Mr. Tallman's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| Or in the interim, let me put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Evaluate proposals like that in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| And then if there's additional funds, some or all those funds are forthcoming from THDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| then we use that opportunity in the interim to decide, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| do we really want to continue with the additional funds the way we're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5384)|
| 1:29:47| or do we want to look at alternatives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| I'm just suggesting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| We would still ask you to support the resolution as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| but certainly we would be open to any kind of proposals like this to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| I would like to let the council know, and Mr. Tallman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| that this year in our annual plan we have $500,000 in HOME| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| and ADDIE dollars for down payment assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| which can be used to help leverage some of these projects as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| I think his point is well taken, and we have committed more this year, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| than we had done even the prior year towards down payment assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Sure, and that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5425)|
| 1:30:26| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5426)|
| 1:30:27| But my point is if we vote as a council tonight to approve the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| which addresses both the money in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| and the anticipated funds or hoped-for funds from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| the understanding is that we may indeed want to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| and revisit what we do with those state funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| Not that we don't give the opportunity to move ahead now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| but we also are clear on the record, at least I want us to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| that we have that opportunity in the interim to go back and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| Yes, and I would frankly encourage the subrecipients to take a look at, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| for us to continue talking, to look at the rules, the regulations with these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| particularly related to the purchase price for acquisitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| issues related to program income, and we'll have some time to really look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| And, in fact, if it does appear to be too onerous for a subrecipient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5480)|
| 1:31:25| or if the regulations change, we will come back to you on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| and that would be an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| Any other questions or would someone like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5492)|
| 1:31:37| Anyone like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5498)|
| 1:31:39| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| Motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| I heard seven ayes and Mr. Frost a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| I think that being all the business to come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| Thank you all for coming tonight, and have a great Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil081125special?start=5521)|
