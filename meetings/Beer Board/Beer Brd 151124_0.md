| 0:06:17| Do you want to tell us about your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Oh, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| My husband and I have been brewing beer for 20 years as a hobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| When our children, one graduated from college, one went to college, we decided to open up a business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| being moved from Anderson County to Knoxville to open up our dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=388)|

| 0:06:44| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=404)|
| 0:06:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=405)|

| 0:07:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| I thought you would move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=422)|

| 0:07:08| Next is the Old City Wine and Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=428)|
| 0:07:18| My name is Thomas Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| The address is 108 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=444)|
| 0:07:25| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| No applicable records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Mr. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| We still need the building, fire, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| Move to approve, pen, and file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=455)|

| 0:07:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Now tell us about your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| We will sell wine, and it will be very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Are we going to have any food there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| Small plates, some cheese and charcuterie, some house-made cheese, house-made charcuterie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| How long do you think until all the construction is finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| I was told it would be one more week, but I'm going to guess probably another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| You're a wise man starting out, because we have some people here who applied in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| and they were just really sure they had opened the next month, and they're still not open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| My original schedule would have been two months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Well, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Councilman De La Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| For those of us not of French origin to know what a charcuterie is and would we like eating it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=501)|
| 0:08:26| Pickles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Just cured meats, any type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| You can cure just about anything, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| You can cure eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Just, you know, proper use of time and salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Next is Starbucks, number 8536 on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| My name is Bradley Beal, 4924 Kingston Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=527)|
| 0:08:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| No record, and we did receive the owner-manager form today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Oh, that's always music to our ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=542)|
| 0:09:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| Is this Starbucks just a change in ownership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=548)|
| 0:09:09| We've tested this in markets mostly out west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=549)|
| 0:09:12| I think there are some in Atlanta, too, and some other venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| It's been going on for about five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| It's done very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| We're basically looking forward to capture that evening crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| We've done studies that most people quit drinking coffee at four unless it's decaf in the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| So offering a safe, clean environment for our consumers, we're trying to capture that evening crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Are you going to have pumpkin beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| We've been asked this question, and we don't really – we haven't saw the complete lineup yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| We will carry beer and wine, and we will serve it in the glass and in the mugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| and we also have, like the last gentleman said, small plates and steak skewers and flatbread pizzas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=586)|
| 0:09:52| It's a lot of evening food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=592)|
| 0:09:53| It's a real new change for Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Yes, we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Well, you don't have to have pumpkin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| It seems like the whole world is turning into pumpkin-flavored something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| I think pumpkin spice does it for us, and the latte off the bat, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Thank you very much, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Next is Tienda Noni number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=611)|

| 0:10:35| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=635)|
| 0:10:36| We still need the building and fire prevention approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Anything on those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| Building and fire prevention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| Everybody was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Everything is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Well, they must have not notified Ms. Day yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| At the end of the meeting, you can talk to her, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Good luck with your new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Tienda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Next we have some familiar faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| The first is the Market House Cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| And she's going to explain why she's here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| and not the gentleman last month who promised us this would be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| Bernadette West for the Market House Cafe, which is 36 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=679)|
| 0:11:25| I am begging please for another extension for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| I tried to get the gentleman, Mr. Kehoe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| the last time when he promised that he would get it done in 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| to come back and ask for an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| but he was too embarrassed to come back up last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| I just wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| We do have a couple of finals on a couple of inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| but we're still lacking like two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| So with the Thanksgiving weekend, it's getting really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| The next beer board meeting will be December 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| so this gives you about five days left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| We are very, very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| If this doesn't happen, we will reapply and try for the end of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| I'll help get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| Do I have a motion to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd151124?start=732)|
