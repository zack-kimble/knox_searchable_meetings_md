| 0:02:45| Okay. Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| I have two. Both are postponements for two weeks. It is 12B and 11A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=171)|
| 0:03:00| 11A is the resolution on convenience voting and we are having a public hearing June 1st at 5 o'clock on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=180)|
| 0:03:08| So I'd like to postpone both of those until the June 2nd meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| 11A and 12B. Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Okay. The motion is to postpone for two weeks. Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=197)|
| 0:03:21| Gallows in favor of postponing 11A and 12B for two weeks, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Opposed no. They are postponed. Anything else to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| Okay. Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| Okay. And we do not have any consent items tonight, so that deals with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| Mayor's report very briefly. This is public works week, May 17th through the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| As you all know, our public works department has 424 employees, includes engineering, plans review and inspections, and public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=224)|
| 0:03:52| Steve King is the director of our public works department and Brent Johnson runs engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| Gary Norman has inspections and David Brace is the deputy director of the public service division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| Thursday at 9 a.m. on volunteer landing, we'll have a proclamation recognizing public works week and council is invited to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=242)|
| 0:04:09| That's Thursday at 9 a.m. at volunteer landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| And this Thursday is sundown in the city. We're about halfway through, believe it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| And Thursday is Grupo Fantasma, known as the funkiest, finest, and hardest working Latin orchestra to come out of the United States in the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=258)|
| 0:04:28| Anybody want to argue with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| The weather should be great, so come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Okay. Reports from council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=277)|
| 0:04:38| Thank you. Like I did last meeting, I'd like to remind folks Monday, Memorial Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| Honor Fountain City Day at Fountain City Park and Fountain City Lake from noon until about 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=282)|

| 0:04:51| Thank you. Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Mr. Mayor and members of council, I had the great honor and pleasure yesterday of attending the centennial of the Arthur Street Fire Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=293)|
| 0:05:03| And it was great to see the camaraderie out there, the way the community came to that fire hall and looked at the pictures and reminisced about firemen they knew in the 30s and 40s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=303)|
| 0:05:15| And last of all, I want to say bravo to the city councilman who just couldn't resist sliding down the brass pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=315)|
| 0:05:25| The person shall remain nameless at the time, but the person knows who the person is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| This video exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| Vice Mayor Becker, you just happen to be next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you. I just wanted to remind all the council members and all the public that budget hearings, not quite as exciting as sliding down a fire pole, but almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=342)|
| 0:05:51| We'll start tomorrow morning at 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| And I'm not sure, Ms. Mitchell, if that's in this room or in the room next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| Small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| So 830 tomorrow morning next door to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| We'll be meeting tomorrow until about lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| And then we pick it up again on June 1st for an all day hearing on the budget, public hearing on the budget and on convenient voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=365)|
| 0:06:15| Five o'clock Monday, June 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| Public's encouraged to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=377)|

| 0:06:36| Miss Ray is with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| I thought maybe she might like to stand and wave at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| I think everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| Thank you for agreeing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Long been active in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=411)|

| 0:07:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| All those in favor. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=427)|

| 0:07:25| Victoria DeFreeze has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Victoria DeFreeze, 2921 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| I just thought that I read the statute and realized that somebody from MPC has to serve on the Public Property Naming Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=451)|
| 0:07:40| But I just thought that it would be more fitting for a citizen who's serving on the MPC Commission as opposed to the Executive Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=460)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=471)|

| 0:08:44| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| 9C is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northeast side of Flanagan Avenue, southeast side of Merrillville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=525)|

| 0:08:57| Flanagan Housing LP Applicant First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| We do have three folks signed up to speak against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=541)|
| 0:09:05| I know right now that's all I have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| So I'm going to go ahead and ask those folks to come forward in the order they signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| First is Victoria DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Victoria DeFreeze, 2921 Tipton Station Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=565)|
| 0:09:28| I understand that this is the second reading and it was approved on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| And when this was the MPC, it's been rather contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| There was a task force assigned on site selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| which was dissolved because two attorneys in town thought that it would expose Knox County to litigation because of the Fair Housing Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=579)|
| 0:09:49| I just think that that only allowed or actually maybe it restricted us from using certain terminology such as chronic homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=589)|
| 0:09:59| and had us use more neutered terms such as zoning to get this thing pushed through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| South Knoxville, we take pride in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| We are excited to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| There are business people who are trying to thrive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| And what keeps happening in South Knoxville is we keep getting dumped on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| We keep getting the halfway housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| We keep getting the Helen Ross McNabb, which the community was in support of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| And South Knoxville has been in support of a number of these types of facilities that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=624)|
| 0:10:30| But it seems to me that we are taking a significant number more than other sectors of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=630)|
| 0:10:38| And I just would ask that you take that into consideration and don't make South Knoxville the dumping grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| We also on the same piece of property have a housing unit for the indigent care for the elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=644)|
| 0:10:52| And I think that this is going to be a bad mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| I've spoken to some of the people on the forefront of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| That is a program that exists in about 300 cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| I spoke to some people out in Denver, Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| who have had great success at their 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| When I spoke to the people out there about what we were doing here with the Project of Flinagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| they thought that this may not be successful because of the numbers that we're going to put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| There's going to be about 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| That's a heavy concentration without that much support that's there on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| These people need a number of transitional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| And I think that we need to rethink this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| And, you know, I know that we have issues here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=697)|
| 0:11:41| And we have citizens who have a lot of burdens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| And we want to see that those people become thriving individuals in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| We all need to share in this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=710)|
| 0:11:52| I know that you have this building here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| It's a historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| It's going to be expensive to restore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| And I think that there are probably other locations around town that we need to consider for such a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| And just because you have the available site doesn't mean that you always have to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| on the second reading, this measure and this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| And I do want to see Knoxville overcome our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| I do want to see other sectors of the city also share in supporting these people that need to be empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=736)|
| 0:12:25| and need to be uplifted out from where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| So I would just ask right now that you would please carefully consider your vote on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Next is Nancy Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=757)|
| 0:12:49| If you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| My name is Nancy Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I live at 129 Henry Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| I can look down on the Flinnegan School area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| I've lived there for over 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| And there are numerous small children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| And like they said, also there is for the handicapped and disabled at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=786)|
| 0:13:11| I do work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| I understand, you know, they do have problems because I work for an organization for the mentally retarded and handicapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| I think that by putting that many people there, we are not allowed to know what their history is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| We only know that they say they're going to be screened by Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| And when we were told about this, too, they said that they would not leave on site anyone with them, but they would be checked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=813)|
| 0:13:42| From what I've seen, a check means, hi, how are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| You're doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| See you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| How is that going to protect the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| And especially if pedophiles are put there and small children live near there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=831)|
| 0:13:57| And I really think, you know, they really need to reconsider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=837)|
| 0:14:02| Because like Victoria said, it's too high of a concentration of these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Maybe if they had smaller areas and develop them where you're not having such a high concentrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| and you're specifically saying it's going to be men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| There would be no women, no family whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| It would be only just one person and it would be mostly men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=863)|
| 0:14:26| And what they usually do, I've seen it before, the most vulnerable people that would take and be prey upon others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=866)|
| 0:14:37| will be put in those situations so they can say, we have a place for you to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| and then, you know, the whole neighborhood would be destroyed as far as I'm concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| I know they need a place, but not in a high concentration like we have the older people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=887)|
| 0:14:53| who have a home through KCDC there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| And I think also it could be a threat to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| And Oren Mudrich, I probably mispronounced that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Excuse me if I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| If you'd give us the real way to say your name and your address, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| My name is Oren Mudrich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| I live on 206 Flinnegan Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| I lived in, currently I've lived in South Knoxville and this address for a little over two years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| in hopes of someday starting a family with a nice, safe, clean community with my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=925)|
| 0:15:33| And I've had the opportunity to talk to most of the people around in my neighborhood in the streets and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| And the people in my neighborhood opposed the idea for another housing development location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=941)|
| 0:15:47| Currently there are 42 residents living in the veranda next door to the Flinnegan School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| And more people added to the block means more crowding and congestion for one block of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| If you take the amount of people that live in the veranda, which is 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| and add 48 more people to the block, you end up with 90 residents total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=962)|
| 0:16:11| which is a lot for one city block, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Also, crime is increasing in the neighborhood with theft, drugs, and guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=974)|
| 0:16:19| Most of these crimes are in low-income housing, but also in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| Most people are afraid to go out at night due to these crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| These are not safe conditions for more people in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=988)|
| 0:16:34| Sidewalks and streets are deteriorating in the neighborhood, which makes it hard to get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| More needs to be done, I think, to improve the community rather than increase the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1000)|
| 0:16:46| I also understand that there is talks of possibly improving downtown Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| With the current idea, there's more stores, more walkways, better scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| Flinnegan School, I believe, would honestly make a really good addition to this idea for future business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1017)|
| 0:17:05| Also, the Flinnegan School project itself, from the meetings that I've attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| there's been a lot of questions and a lot of not really solid answers, I feel like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| The current plan is ten years, but what happens after ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Where do people go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Who will pay to help after ten years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| What happens to people that don't succeed in the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Do they end up back on the street, which is where they came from originally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| Most homeless in the U.S. are disabled or handicapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Is it possible to stop a natural part of life?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| That's my other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| But I don't believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| It's just something that we've faced ever since man has been on this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| Most homeless people do not have a source of income and usually have to beg for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| I don't mean that they get turned away because they don't have money to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| I feel like, in a sense, that ten years is a long time, but it's not a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| Flinnegan School has the potential to become something better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| especially with the current economic condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| More and more people are becoming unemployed, no jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| and more places for business means more homeless people on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| Flinnegan School could help to open the door of preventing homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1103)|
| 0:18:27| by having business move into South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Comments from members of Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Who's here from the Office of the Tenure Plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Mr. Arning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Mr. Lawler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| Mr. Lawler, one of the speakers addressed a concern about the frequency of the visitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| of the supportive counselors for the residents of a facility like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| Could you address that the reference was made to once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Could you address how frequently residents will be checked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| and, you know, to what extent that counseling will take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| how long will the interventions be, what sort of checklists might be looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| that kind of thing, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| First of all, my name is John Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| I work with the Tenure Plan here at 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1159)|
| 0:19:22| Instead of me answering that, that's a programming issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Let me let either Bruce or Ginny from VMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| who Southeast Housing will hire to provide the case management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| That's a very important word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| It's case management services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| So, Ginny, if you will respond to Councilman Roddy's question, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1179)|
| 0:19:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I'm Ginny Weatherstone with the Volunteer Ministry Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| My address is 9025 Candlewood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| And with respect to that question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| let me tell you that it's not really permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| unless that support is prevalent and ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| At Flennican, what we anticipate is that the case management is offered on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| That means that there are full-time case managers who office there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| and that there is 24-hour awake staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| So it is much beyond the kind of situation where somebody is dropped in upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| This is regular opportunities to meet with the case manager on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| One of the things that I think is important as these programs are structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| and we have visited enough successful programs to feel like we've got a pretty good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1235)|
| 0:20:42| is that the offices for the case managers, the community area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| the places where people come to get their mail are all centrally located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| so that the interaction between the case manager and the resident becomes a daily thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| It is much beyond a monthly thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| And I have a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| In terms of the visits that you have made to other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1266)|
| 0:21:10| where programs such as this are already in place and are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| what is the concentration of residents typically in a facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| Another concern that was expressed was that too many residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| are being asked to be housed in this one facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| I think the city that I would probably refer to is Portland, Oregon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1285)|
| 0:21:31| where we were able to spend a good deal of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Portland has reduced its street population by 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| And when we investigated how that could have happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| it is through permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| As we visited different projects, we saw them ranging anywhere from 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1303)|
| 0:21:50| I think we did see one that was like 35 residents, up to 150, 175.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1310)|
| 0:21:57| The larger the number of residents, of course, the more case managers are on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1317)|
| 0:22:06| But in all instances, I would say that the smallest was about 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| And as the number went up, there did not seem to be a problem in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| because the supportive services were strong and present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Councilman Frost, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Mr. Johnson, you're here for MPC tonight, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| A couple questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Tonight is a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| This is not the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| So if the zoning is granted or denied tonight, housing does not go forward at this point, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| The only thing that would change would be the zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I just wanted to reinforce the point that we're having a good discussion, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| on what's coming up potentially with the use on review situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| You know, last meeting we discussed a little bit about how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| a C3 in the middle of a neighborhood is not necessarily the best thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| and an office zoning is used as a transition between commercial uses and residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1392)|
| 0:23:21| You know, like I said at the previous meeting, just because someone votes for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| under no circumstance means that they're going to vote for a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| if a use on review ever gets to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| It's a, you know, part of what was said at MPC in the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| This is a part of an issue, and if, for sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1420)|
| 0:23:46| if this rezoning passes and the use on review does not pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| well then you probably have more appropriate zoning on this parcel that butts up to a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1441)|
| 0:24:02| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I think, Mr. Cross, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| I don't want to belabor the permanent support of housing, but I have two questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| one for Mr. Longren and I think one for the mayor about sort of long-term funding for sites all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| Mr. Longren, there was a good question that somebody asked about what happens in 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| and I think can you just say a word about what our plans are for making this sustainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Because this is permanent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| This is permanent housing that these folks are going to be there for a very long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| and how is it going to work not just in 10 but 20, 30, 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| I think when you think about sustainability and affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| and then you put on top of that the concept of permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| you've got to think about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| First of all, do the renters have a payment source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| And the answer to that is yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| They all will get Section 8 vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| Those will be tenant-based vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| So there will be a revenue source for the rent so the operations of the facility is sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1506)|
| 0:25:14| Secondly, you have to ask yourself, well, the support services, as Jenny said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| there is no such thing as permanent supportive housing without support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| How are you going to sustain the provision of the support services, specifically the case management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1525)|
| 0:25:33| That's something that all of you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| Our office has been working hard to raise money to provide for different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| At the same time, Volunteer Ministry Center, several years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| raised their hand when it came to the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| and said we will be the support service provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Volunteer Ministry Center has been around for 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| and for 20 years it has funded its mission in the budget associated with its mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| Volunteer Ministry Center will have to grow its capacity to support the case managers that it currently has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1560)|
| 0:26:06| and it will have, but through Volunteer Ministry has a lot of capacity using federal grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1566)|
| 0:26:13| using greater local support, and using support of the 10-year plan office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1573)|
| 0:26:18| because we believe that this must happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| That's how you make something like this sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| If you remember, the 10-year plan talks about this being a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1585)|
| 0:26:29| So the sustainability of this also has to do with the community coming around it and funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| It is a proven solution, and it serves some of the most vulnerable members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| So sustainability when it comes to case management will result from VMC growing their capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| and the community having greater ownership of ensuring that case management is at Flanagan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| and every other facility that's developed for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| I guess a question for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| I know that one of the concerns about this is sort of how it does get shared around the whole community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| and always an issue that to do this affordably means a tendency is to look at low-income neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1628)|
| 0:27:14| and I know your administration has done some very proactive things to change that equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| I wonder if you can just say briefly what you've all done on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| I think we do understand the concern that we, you know, have a great mix of locations in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| and we're working, and John and others in the 10-year plan office are working hard to do the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| to try to find those locations that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1654)|
| 0:27:36| Obviously, it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| I mean, we'll be, you know, brutally honest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| To find places where we can make the numbers work, where we can get the available zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| and all the issues that come around it, it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| When we started the 10-year plan, I thought, well, the hardest part will be raising the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| Now I'd tell you the hardest part is finding the locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| But I still think it's the right thing to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| and we are committed to having those spread throughout the entire city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| Councilman Hucklist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Mayor, just to follow that up on your statement, I had another question related to what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| You said finding available property, I think, and available zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1690)|
| 0:28:16| Well, I'm not sure if I understand, because this property requires rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| so that means that I would assume that any property that we would be looking at could require rezoning on the same basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| So zoning is not the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Well, no, but it is because you see how difficult it is to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| I mean, anywhere, it's just a tough process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| That's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Saying it's a tough process is different than saying available zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| Available zoning, that's a different term, and it implies that the zoning is already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| No, I didn't mean to imply that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Obviously, in many of these cases, as we're seeing right here, you're going to have to have things rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| and it's obviously a very difficult process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| I'd like to ask Mr. Lawler a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I'm hearing about, you know, we need to more equitably spread these things around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| and not just the city, but outside the city in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| And, you know, you just mentioned about having the zoning in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| There are presently available apartment complexes for sale that obviously have the zoning they need to operate as an apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1759)|
| 0:29:32| What is, and they're in all parts of town, what's, for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| holding up exploration of properties that are presently available, that are obviously multifamily, and have the zoning in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1779)|
| 0:29:50| It's a good question because I think you're going to better understand some of the challenges our office is up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1790)|
| 0:29:58| Fortunately for our office, we have a partner like Southeast Housing Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| who has said that we will be the permanent supportive housing development partner for the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| No one else in the community has stepped up and said they would like that role because, number one, it's a very difficult role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| and, number two, these are hard projects to put together financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| Southeast Housing Foundation is a nonprofit development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| and they don't have a big bucket of funds where they can go out and acquire a bunch of different properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1830)|
| 0:30:40| In actuality, they need to work on these things on a one-by-one basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| because Flinagan was tied up through an option, which is pretty inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| But Southeast Housing does not have the financial wherewithal to go out and tie up a bunch of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| while it looks to get the tax credits together and other funding sources to make these things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| So if there are available properties out there, but Southeast Housing is approaching these on a one-by-one basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| simply because it has the financial wherewithal to only move at that speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| But, you know, we've spent lots of money on Menvilla for sake of argument, and there have been lots of delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1877)|
| 0:31:28| Community development has come back and gotten extensions of time to get that project done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| and then community development came back with over a million dollars two, three meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1895)|
| 0:31:44| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Why does it have to be some sort of tax credit project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| Why do you always have to go through those steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Wouldn't it be easier to not fool with government in some circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| and buy something that is presently available and isn't a huge, expensive undertaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1919)|
| 0:32:08| I guess my point is when you have apartment complexes that are available for about $60,000 a unit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1928)|
| 0:32:18| you know, why can't we do something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| I mean, I understand you're saying they're not sitting on a big pile of cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| but how is it we can find the ability to do huge projects in certain parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1947)|
| 0:32:35| that cost exorbitant amounts of money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| That's a multi-question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Yeah, back to what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| There are some opportunities with some new funds that community development is getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| that we're going to be able to put deals together a little bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| But, again, there's no way to tie something up unless you have the money to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| and make a legitimate offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| The way that Southeast is funding these things, it has to assemble many different sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| and so it normally has to tie these things up through an option, which is inexpensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| Our office is not funded to the point where we can assist Southeast Housing to tie these things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| And so Southeast Housing is, given its financial wherewithal, doing it at the rate it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| David, would you like to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| I just wanted to address your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| David Arning, Southeastern Housing Foundation, 901 East Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Originally you asked specifically what's keeping us from exploring those options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| and I just want to be clear that we are exploring them now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| which I'm not sure if that's what you meant or why they're not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| But I don't want to give council the impression we're not already looking into those options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| because they are viable with the proper funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| I think for us the biggest challenge to go out and try to buy an existing market rate apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| that's for sale would be credit, just trying to go get a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Southeastern Housing Foundation doesn't have the balance sheet to go out, and even if it did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| these permanent supportive housing projects don't support much, if any, debt service on the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2055)|
| 0:34:20| just because they don't generate much cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| But we very much are looking into other options that won't have as many funding sources as Menville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| and wouldn't necessarily tie us to that timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Let me ask you, how much, if you all wanted to go through the process of being able to have an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2072)|
| 0:34:40| I mean, Mr. Lawler's been involved in real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| I know, and I'm sorry, I don't know the extent of your involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| How much would be in a pool of funds that would be good to allow you all to go forward to exercise options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2089)|
| 0:34:59| That's a difficult question for me to answer because I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| if it's 5 percent or 10 percent of the purchase price to tie it up, depending on how large the property is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2103)|
| 0:35:11| I mean, you might be looking at $50,000, $100,000 more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| As John mentioned, Flinnegan is a little bit different scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| in that the property doesn't have a lot of value right now, so we were able to tie it up relatively cheaply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| But if we were to ask for a pot of money to do that, I'm not, I would need to give that some thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| How much was the option for Flinnegan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| How much did that cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| And, David, are there apartment buildings out there that you could tie up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| Councilman Frost's question is that you could tie up relatively inexpensively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| and then work to put the grants together like you have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| Is that realistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| We have not found one yet, but we are looking, and I do think that's a realistic possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| We're going into budget tomorrow for sake of argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| But I think it's a helpful question to know, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Councilman Booker, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| I can understand how Menvilla was chosen for that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Who came up with the idea to use Flinnegan School?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| What was the rationale for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| You're looking at him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| You can blame me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| And, actually, it goes back to I was working for a for-profit commercial developer prior to coming to Southeastern Housing Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2183)|
| 0:36:31| and I had an interest in that property, in historic properties in general, underutilized properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2191)|
| 0:36:37| And so when I first started working, we were looking at the old Parkway Motel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| and we weren't able to make a project work there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| but there were a lot of characteristics about that area with the transit, proximity services, et cetera, that we like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| And, frankly, I threw that out to the tenure plan office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| We discussed it, and that's kind of where it came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2215)|
| 0:36:58| But I personally believe that that's the only financially feasible way to redevelop that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| and I do think it's a property that's worth saving, and I do believe that this would be a good use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Yeah, I sort of have a sense that Ms. DeFries and Ms. Weatherstone would like to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2232)|
| 0:37:19| and I want to give you all an opportunity to address us on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| One thing that I want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| If you could give us your name and address real quick, and I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| And I just had something that I wanted to add, and it is simply this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Because there is an apartment building that is for sale does not mean that it is amenable to permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2255)|
| 0:37:43| There are a couple of things that, from a programmatic point of view, I would consider to be indispensable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| and one is that we have to be able to create a central point of entry, a single point of entry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2269)|
| 0:37:57| Sometimes that's very difficult when you have an apartment building where every apartment has its own exit to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| Something else that I think is important in a permanent supportive housing is that there be adequate space for a community room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| for community activities, both for the residents and for the community in which the permanent supportive housing is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2291)|
| 0:38:19| So finances absolutely are a consideration, but the property itself has to be amenable to the programming that's going to go into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2299)|
| 0:38:29| Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Vice Mayor, for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2312)|
| 0:38:37| I'm just hearing all of this with the Southeast Housing Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I don't know if you all have tried to Google that, but I did, and they are a small organization, a non-profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| I am concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| We do keep coming back almost as if this is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| I just feel that the stars are all aligned with who you have with the ten-year plan of chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2334)|
| 0:39:02| and with the affiliation that we have with Southeast Housing Foundation and with the prospective person who's going to be running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| It just looks like this is just a done deal, and here we are talking about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| but we keep getting into all of the details because this just seems like this is a train that's going downhill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| and the community is not going to be able to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| I would like at this time for everybody who is in the audience to please stand up if you're in opposition of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| because I don't know if they've been officially recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Okay, if you could please remain standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| We have attended several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| These people have come out here when we were at a Boys and Girls Club out in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2379)|
| 0:39:47| and I asked what kind of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I mean, we kept hearing that we needed community support for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| We needed community support for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| And when we asked what, you know, obviously you don't have community support right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| There's a lot of people that are opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| We had Mr. Lawler say that he's spoken with the area churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| I would like to know with a raise of hands, if I may be so bold, for the city council people who are going to vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2407)|
| 0:40:16| have you been to Vestal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| Have you been to this community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| I'm glad that you have been to Vestal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| But in Vestal, you understand then, if you've driven through Vestal, that there is we're trying to revitalize the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2424)|
| 0:40:33| We have the South Knox Waterfront coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| We're trying to revitalize this fragile neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| and the resources are not quite there at the area churches to be much of a support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| especially when you have the citizens who care so much about this project to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| It's not that we oppose the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| I think it's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| I've talked to other people in other cities that have seen success in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| and I think it's great that our mayor is so concerned and that he is wanting to see a successful turnaround for our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| and I think that vision is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| But this really concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| We have schools that let out in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| We have a lot of lack-key children, if you still call it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| children who don't have their parents at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| The area businesses have the children coming into their stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| They've had to call and complain at the different apartments because the children go around unsupervised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| There are no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| There's a liquor store just within blocks of this proposed Flinnegan project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2491)|
| 0:41:38| I'm just very, very concerned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| And to say that this is a zoning-only issue, I think we're all kidding ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| This is not like Lady Justice with blindfolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| So please remember South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Mr. Waller, I wanted to make a comment and ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| As Councilman Frost pointed out, we are talking about the zoning tonight, but it's highly likely this will come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| And as we see the stakeholders and the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| you know, during this process I was talking to former Councilman Nick Pavlis that when the siding task force broke down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2531)|
| 0:42:21| it appeared to a number of people in the community that the communications broke down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| And, you know, we've had a very thorough, I think one of the things that this council sees as very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2546)|
| 0:42:36| is communications and a public process and a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| And the more you do that, the more information is passed and the better off we all are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2560)|
| 0:42:47| And I'm wondering when that task force was no longer really thought they could meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| and can't we or couldn't we have appointed other citizens to that committee or can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| Because not only this site here, but any site across the city, you know, there's going to be concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| There's going to be the same things going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| So I'm wondering, you know, have we learned anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Can we do anything more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Can we pick up the process where it broke down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| Yeah, it's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| And we shared the same frustration that a lot of the neighborhood residents shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| when we were asked by the law director to not go ahead and have the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| How we responded to that, however, was to hold a meeting at Cherokee Health Center in their community room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| where we invited the community, the neighborhood organizations from COIN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2620)|
| 0:43:47| and all the other significant neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| A lot of the city council members were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| A lot of the mayor's staff were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| County commissioners were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| And what we did at that meeting was we approached the issue from a different angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| And what we did to facilitate dialogue is we asked really two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| We had all the stakeholders represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| and we asked each stakeholder to put themselves in someone else's shoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| and answer the question, what do you need from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| or what do you need from a permanent supportive housing development for that entity to be a good neighbor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| And, you know, the irony of the whole experience was whether you're a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| or a resident of the neighborhood, you essentially need about the same things from the other entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| In order to be a good neighbor, you need someone who is there interested in your interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| as much as they are in their own interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| And so we had that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| It was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| We had a follow-up meeting approximately two weeks ago, or two weeks ago tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| where we debriefed the communities on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| And then we even asked at that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| what are other topics you want our office to facilitate a conversation about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| And so we have our list of five or six other topics that we're going to facilitate a conversation about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| So we are a huge believer in and advocate of the value of a community conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| because if we go back up to the macro level, this is a community issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| Ending chronic homelessness is not just an issue that my office is concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| In order to be successful as a community, the community has to own this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| but the community has to be involved in the conversation of what does the solution look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| and how do we all become a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| So I think we've taken steps and we're committed to continue to take the right steps to have a community conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| How about appointing others to that siting task force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| Let me just – I don't think it was an issue that we couldn't have council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| It was the – and Ron, correct me if I'm wrong here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| The law directors, both city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| felt like having anyone have a discussion about appropriate sites was going to get us in trouble with the fair house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| Am I right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| It wasn't a matter of having council people or city people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| It's having anyone have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| Am I right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I'm going to go to Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| I'm not sure whose light was next, but I'm going to go to Councilwoman Pilo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| and then I'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Well, I'm glad that Councilwoman Bailey made that comment and asked that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| because I was just going to comment on those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| and how I thought they were extremely helpful to me in understanding some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| that have been brought up this evening and some of the questions that were brought to council this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| I believe some – I would so encourage some of the folks who have those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| to become personally involved in those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| because it's very, very helpful to be in a setting where one could ask those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| and have people who are there to provide those answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| and to give consideration to a lot of the concerns that are voiced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| So I will have to applaud the efforts to bring the entire city together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2827)|
| 0:47:13| and anyone is – they're public meetings, they're open to everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| and I think have been very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| So I have to applaud the effort to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| and I think it's – I think it has answered a lot of questions for a number of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| The first one is for Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| The scope of this – of the population, the problem that we have here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| does that lead you to – how many of these facilities do you believe we will need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| to adequately address the goal of ending chronic homelessness in our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2864)|
| 0:47:50| And that being said, if each one is a 40 to 50-unit facility, how many facilities do you think we will need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2870)|
| 0:48:01| Estimated when the plan began implementation, 800 individuals in our community chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2881)|
| 0:48:08| Jenny and I were just talking before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| VMC alone placed nine chronically homeless individuals in Permanent Support Housing last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| You can do the math and see that, boy, that 800 at that rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| we'll finish the task way before the 10 years is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| However, what we're running into is there's a lack of affordable units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| especially that are designed like Jenny spoke about programmatically to help us be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2916)|
| 0:48:42| Our goal is to develop approximately 400 Permanent Support of Housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| So if you said they averaged 50, then you're talking about eight different developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| So that's about what we think will serve the needs of the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2932)|
| 0:48:59| So my assumption is if eight units is the final tally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| then they'll be spread out geographically around our community as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| And, again, I maybe undersold David's efforts a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| David has been very good about working with a real estate firm here to locate sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| and he is constantly strategizing with different funding sources how to tie those sites up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2959)|
| 0:49:24| But they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| And as Vice Mayor Becker always reminds me not to say we'll spread these out all over the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2965)|
| 0:49:31| We're going to spread these out programmatically as it works throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| My second question is for Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Mr. Johnson is evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| And this has to do with a question that I received from a constituent in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| regarding the current nature or not current, I guess, of the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| I guess the last time the sector plan for this area was updated was 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| And is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| And how often are those sector plans to be updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| We like to get them to them on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| Right now we try to do anywhere from two to four a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| By 2002, so it's a five, six, seven-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| As it turns out, we're going to be beginning the South City update this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3019)|
| 0:50:26| It's in our work program for FY2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| It will probably be completed sometime next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| So that would be seven to eight years, I guess, between plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Is that unusual to have that long a gap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| I thought it was mandated that it was every five years, but I could be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| I think initially that we tried to do them every five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| but it gets so that it's hard to keep up to that schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| But it's a regular rotation that we try to update the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| So at this point, the data that we're dealing with in terms of recommendations for this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| does date back to 2002, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| I don't know that the sector plan has been updated for this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| but the basic plan was approved in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| Any other lights for council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| I think Mr. Freeze would like to add something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| I'd like to hear from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you, Steve Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| I was just trying to figure the math, and I thank you so much, Marilyn Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| for asking the questions that you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| But if 400 units are needed, then the MinnVilla project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| and the proposed Flinnegan project would account for nearly 25% of the needed housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| So that would mean that if they are going to have eight of these type of facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| the rest are going to be quite small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3105)|
| 0:51:47| And, again, I just want to point out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| when I talked to the people who have been very successful at this in Denver, Colorado,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| again, they warned about the heavy concentration of this being a successful program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| at Flinnegan because of the large numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| So I thank you for your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I was just taking notes, and I just wanted to share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Other comments by members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| We don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| Councilman Holquist, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Well, based on the vote last time, I would guess that it's probably the rezoning is probably going to pass this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3136)|
| 0:52:25| I don't want to presuppose what council is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| And I understand the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| I just want to say that based on my --I'm not going to restate what I said last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| but I'm not going to be able to support the rezoning for the same reasons I did not support it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3154)|
| 0:52:43| There's still no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| I'll move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| I heard Holquist, Hall, and Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3177)|

| 0:57:10| different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| To speak in favor first is Mr. Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Mr. Mayor, members of council, Harold Cannon and I are here on behalf of the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| and Mr. Cannon will be speaking in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| I may use the visuals here if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| This involves a driveway entrance onto Washington Pike for a new apartment complex on Washington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3449)|
| 0:57:48| Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| It is a development that will include 264 apartments in Phase 1 and in Phase 2 there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| will be an additional 286 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| The situation gets a little complicated because the property where the apartments are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3482)|
| 0:58:10| built is outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| It will be annexed into the city of Knoxville, as I understand, in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| However, Washington Pike is in the city of Knoxville and the entrance is in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| of Knoxville and thus we are before city council with the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| The road leading to the apartment complex off Washington Pike is classified as a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3512)|
| 0:58:40| driveway and is limited in width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| Therefore, the request for variance to make an entrance into the apartment, this is north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3524)|
| 0:58:52| east, west, south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| The entrance would be one lane in, the exit would be two lanes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3534)|
| 0:59:02| We have a traffic study which Mr. Cannon has prepared that recommends this configuration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3542)|
| 0:59:10| If approved, traffic exiting from the apartment going west can merge into westbound traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Traffic going east would stop, both would stop, and then, when convenient, merge that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| It has been determined by the traffic engineers that it is best to have this kind of configuration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3568)|
| 0:59:35| for safety purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| Otherwise, Harold, let me sort of take this up, otherwise we are limited for these 264| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3577)|
| 0:59:44| apartments to one lane in, which is what we would be without the variance, but only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3584)|
| 0:59:53| lane out, which would cause traffic to stack here, which causes bad driver behavior when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3593)|
| 1:00:01| you've got a car that has stopped here for some length of time trying to turn left and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3601)|
| 1:00:08| you've got cars trying to exit to the right or go west on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| The variance is required because these 264 apartments do not require 400 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3615)|
| 1:00:28| They will have over 400 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Were they required to have 400 parking spaces, under the city ordinance, this type of driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3632)|
| 1:00:40| would probably have been required by city engineering because the zoning ordinance states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| that if 400 parking spaces are required, you are not limited in the driveway width as we are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3647)|
| 1:00:54| When we go to phase two, we will have more than 400 required spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3654)|
| 1:01:02| This will be a major development, and as I understand, city engineering will require,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3662)|
| 1:01:09| under the zoning ordinance, the configuration we are asking for here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| With that, I'd like to reserve whatever time I have left and turn it to Harold Cannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| of Cannon & Cannon, whose firm did the traffic analysis for this project, which was submitted to city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3682)|
| 1:01:31| Harold, I will hold the props.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| Harold Cannon with Cannon & Cannon, 8550 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3695)|
| 1:01:39| Councilwoman Pelo, I apologize. When this was brought before BZA, Jeff Beckett of our firm spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| He's had a death in the family, and you've got the second team tonight, so let me apologize from the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| Basically what the developer is proposing, and this is what is before you, is with the 264 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3711)|
| 1:01:59| based on the traffic impact study, could the two lanes accommodate that number of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3719)|
| 1:02:05| in essence, a 26-foot wide driveway? The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3725)|
| 1:02:11| Could the driveway accommodate those traffic flows with the minimum curb cut requirement that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3731)|
| 1:02:17| which is the second variance, the curb cut being no more than 60 feet for a driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| We would respectfully offer, from a safety standpoint, the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| So under the scenario of a two-lane driveway, which would meet the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3749)|
| 1:02:35| versus the three-lane that has been proposed, we would respectfully offer that there would be a variance before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3755)|
| 1:02:42| We have 264 residential dwelling units there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| The reason that we have asked for a variance on the driveway width itself, which is going from 30 feet to 37 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| this will allow the construction of the ultimate driveway configuration should other phases of this development occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| Those improvements would be complete at Washington Pike, and Washington Pike would not have to be modified for that to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3780)|
| 1:03:07| As information, it did not require a variance, but there is a center turn lane being added to Washington Pike to facilitate movements into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3787)|
| 1:03:18| The reason for the extra width in this case is related to building the ultimate condition now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3798)|
| 1:03:24| as opposed to coming back to you in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| Ms. Pelo, go ahead. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3811)|
| 1:03:32| No, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| Do I understand correctly that that center turn lane is going to be developed there at the cost of the developer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3814)|
| 1:03:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| This will be at no cost, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| No cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| The city or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| May I reserve my time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| This question is for Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| I believe I heard Mr. Seymour reference that at such time that this property comes into the city under the agreement that is to take effect in 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3840)|
| 1:04:10| that the city design standards would then require this driveway configuration with one in and two out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3850)|
| 1:04:20| And is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| And why would the city not be requiring it now if the ingress and egress portion of the property is already within the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| I think what Mr. Seymour is referring to, when a development requires more than 400 parking spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| it's considered in our zoning ordinance a major traffic generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| And when a traffic impact study is done and makes certain recommendations about driveway widths, a variance isn't required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3879)|
| 1:04:49| So what he is saying is that when the second phase is built and the number of parking spaces is more than 400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3889)|
| 1:04:59| then the driveway as proposed could be constructed without a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3899)|
| 1:05:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| Now I'm more confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| The second phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| It really doesn't have anything to do with annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| The second phase is being built now or is planned for some indefinite time in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| Phase one is all that's in for permits right now is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| And phase two, obviously, will be a couple of years out because phase one, once permits are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| they're ready to start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| That's probably, what, a year or more total until occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| And at that point, start the work on phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| So, Mr. King, under phase one, which is all we are certain about at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| even if the whole property were currently in the city as of today, the smaller driveway configuration would be acceptable under our code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3946)|
| 1:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Mr. Cannon, I have a question for you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| Looking at it, I mean, I went out there as recently as about 630 last night to check on the status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3962)|
| 1:06:10| At what point, assuming this is approved, at what point does the developer construct the road improvements out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| For Washington Pike itself and the entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Please correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| The Washington Pike improvements, I believe, have been approved and bond has been, it is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| And so that would be one of the first phases of construction, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3989)|
| 1:06:33| So, and everything would be coming off the developer's side of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| But now this doesn't include a traffic light or anything, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| No, it does not, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| Mr. King, you know, I'm envisioning this and, you know, when you have three lanes coming into a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4005)|
| 1:06:55| this looks less of a driveway and more of a road to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4015)|
| 1:07:00| With its proximity to mill and the traffic light not that far away, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4020)|
| 1:07:07| are we potentially setting up some conflicting turning situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4027)|
| 1:07:14| Well, anyone that has driven Washington Pike is familiar with the volume of traffic on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4034)|
| 1:07:20| And you will probably recall that improvements to Washington Pike are in the current transportation improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4040)|
| 1:07:29| As a matter of fact, we have, at review with TDOT right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4049)|
| 1:07:33| a planning document that we hope to move forward on improvements to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4053)|
| 1:07:41| So there is some improvements that are needed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4061)|
| 1:07:47| But we think that this will operate at a safe level based on the traffic impact study that Mr. Cannon has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4067)|
| 1:07:56| and also the site distances that are available in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| What's the approximate cost of putting in a traffic signal when we've got, we're going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4080)|
| 1:08:07| it's going to be, it looks like a protected left turn perhaps going into the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| and protected turns leaving the property going out Washington Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| I haven't looked at this one specifically, but typically a traffic signal costs around $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| That's the initial outlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Then there's the cost of maintenance and the power and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4113)|
| 1:08:34| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| Just a quick follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Given the nearness of the Mill Road light, would we even consider putting a stoplight at this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4116)|
| 1:08:45| Well, a signal warrant study would have to be done, and that would certainly be a consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4125)|
| 1:08:51| the proximity to Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| So I wouldn't be prepared to say that it could be warranted at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4134)|
| 1:08:59| And let me ask you, if this road were actually connected to Mill Road, which is 50 yards down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| maybe not even that, we wouldn't need a new traffic light because there's already one there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4144)|
| 1:09:09| We wouldn't be having this discussion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| You mean if the driveway were constructed to line up with Mill Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| The next speaker to speak opposed is Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| Bob Wolfenbarger, 3200 Lexan Lane, Aliceville-Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4166)|
| 1:09:36| I would thank Council and the Mayor for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| I'm going to read rather than speak because I think Mr. Cannon has already made the point that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| based on the application, this development does not have a hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| But I'd like to read the statement so I'll make sure I cover my points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| The requirements of the zoning ordinance may be modified in the case of exceptional, irregular, narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4198)|
| 1:10:04| shallow, or steep lots or other exceptional physical conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| where strict application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| which would deprive the owner of, quote, the reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| The variance shall not be used or shall be used only when necessary to overcome some obstacle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4219)|
| 1:10:25| which is preventing the owner from using the property as the zoning ordinance intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4225)|
| 1:10:31| The zoning ordinance is very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| Article 7, Section 2C, standards of variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| Variances will be granted only where special circumstances or conditions occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4238)|
| 1:10:43| that do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Variances won't be granted to allow a use otherwise excluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| Variances are granted if conditions are such that the strict appliance of this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| would deprive the owner of any reasonable use of their land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| The variance granted shall be the minimum adjustment necessary for reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| Granting any variance must be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, detrimental to public welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| or conflict with the comprehensive plan for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| Further, the requirements for granting a variance are very clear within the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| Article 7, Section 2D states before the council shall have the authority to grant a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4289)|
| 1:11:38| the person claiming a variance has to show burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| And granting the variance will not be in contrary to the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4303)|
| 1:11:48| The literal enforcement of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4308)|
| 1:11:56| By granting the variance, substantial justice will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| We examined this hardship listed that they've talked about and compared it to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| We did not feel the applicant is being denied any reasonable use of his land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| Quite the contrary, Mr. Cannon said that he could do what he wants to do without this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4329)|
| 1:12:15| We do not feel that this land has any special condition that do not apply generally in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| We do not feel that granting of these variances would be the minimum adjustment necessary to allow reasonable use of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| We do not feel that granting the variance is in harmony with the general purpose of the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| and that granting the variance is absolutely contrary to the public welfare and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4356)|
| 1:12:43| The applicant has not demonstrated nor proven a valid hardship under the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4363)|
| 1:12:50| We cannot see how justice will be served by granting this variance as there is no valid hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| Our neighborhood has never had any problem with anyone developing property within the standard subdivision zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| This appeal does not comply with the state and city regulations as set forth for granting a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4383)|
| 1:13:09| And because it doesn't meet the standards, these variances should not be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| We're simply asking the city council to follow zoning ordinances that are in place and not approve this variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| I'd like to reserve my time, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Questions from council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| I guess, actually, Mr. Seymour, by rule, has two minutes to respond at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| I think safety supports the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4413)|
| 1:13:41| The traffic level and so forth on Washington Pike supports this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| The nearness of the development to the absolute parking requirement where it would be approved without a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4428)|
| 1:13:58| certainly is supportive of the applicant's request here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| The applicant is simply requesting that it be allowed to make a situation safer than it is under the strict interpretation of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4442)|
| 1:14:13| And, Mr. Cannon, I think that is your position in your traffic study, which city engineering has supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4453)|
| 1:14:22| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| We will do it without the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| We're simply trying to make this a safer city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| Washington Pike a safer road until the improvements that Mr. King mentioned are ultimately approved and constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4469)|
| 1:14:39| which is certainly going to be a number of years off, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| Mr. King, you would have more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| But approval of this as a project does not mean funding is available at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| And we would certainly support the improvement of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Mr. Seamer, that mic right there is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Looking, I've got a few different maps and there are all sorts of no trespassing signs up around this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| It does have some connection to Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4511)|
| 1:15:17| It's hard to tell from one thing I have, does it connect to any other streets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| Cascadia, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| It's hard to tell from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4527)|
| 1:15:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| I apologize for the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| I did not make the record at the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Yeah, I just have a suspicion that Mr. Warren would like to share something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| You're good at these suspicions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| To address Mr. Frost's question, there is another road from which this property connects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4553)|
| 1:16:03| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| No, I appreciate this development going in, eventually coming inside the city here in a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4567)|
| 1:16:16| Like I said, I went out there last night just as recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| and this project is coming along nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| Unfortunately, the area, the street system around here is overburdened at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4583)|
| 1:16:30| I've got some concerns that we're going to be setting up another large project for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4590)|
| 1:16:40| and the taxpayers to pay the bigger this intersection is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4600)|
| 1:16:48| As we've heard tonight, this project is going forward right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| There's construction equipment out there that I saw last night, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| I'm not sure that based upon the record at BZA here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4617)|
| 1:17:05| and in addition to what folks on both sides of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| I'm not sure that the application of the standards to grant a variance has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4629)|
| 1:17:17| I respectfully move to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| There is a light on for Mr. Hochul, so I'll go ahead and go to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Well, I think this is pertinent to the motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Mr. Wolfenbarger, you had asked me to meet you out there this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| Ran out of time and couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| Can you succinctly state your reasons on behalf of yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| and I guess you're officially representing the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4666)|
| 1:17:53| Just bullet points, reasons for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| I understand the argument against the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4675)|
| 1:17:59| Beyond that, safety, yes, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| I mean, just whatever you want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| If I may respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| First of all, let me say that there's another neighborhood association adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| It's called NEPCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| That president and speaker is not able to be here this evening to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| Lisa Starbuck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| Starbuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| She is a member of the Women's League of Voters, and they're having their election tonight or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| But with regard to, and I don't want to distract from the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| the very pertinent point that this request for a variance does not meet the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4711)|
| 1:18:43| Now, with regard to safety, the community, I don't want to get into the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| because I think it's distracting from the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| The very point is, is their application is for 269 units, and currently they have no burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4728)|
| 1:18:55| But we would differ with the drive as far as safety is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| But, once again, I want to emphasize that from the neighborhood's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4739)|
| 1:19:04| this does not meet the burden of proof that they have a hardship, and we would ask you to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4744)|
| 1:19:13| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| I guess this question is for Bob or maybe Arthur, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| I was out there today, and I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| when we talk about the property and its relationship to the red light, would there have to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4764)|
| 1:19:33| is the church property in the middle of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Would there have to have been property acquired for this particular property to line up to that street light, I mean that red light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4775)|
| 1:19:46| Well, I'm not the developer, but they acquired this particular easement to get access to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4786)|
| 1:19:53| They could have acquired the one at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| From what I understand from rumor, purely rumor, and I want to emphasize that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| they couldn't get together with the church on the number at the time that that deal was being negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4801)|
| 1:20:08| And since then, the primary developer has changed because of economic circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| So that option is probably not on the table any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| I don't know that for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| I wasn't involved in that negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| But I can tell you that four or five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| when the first primary developer came to the community and shared their thoughts with how this grandiose three-property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4830)|
| 1:20:39| three-phase development was going to occur that included this property as the final phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4839)|
| 1:20:46| it included aligning this property access at Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4846)|
| 1:20:53| And it also included an access point onto McCampbell Drive, which is at the back of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4853)|
| 1:21:01| contrary to something that was said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| So the original plan has changed significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| As I said at BZA, the developer's concept plan and the choice of this property created their perceived burden or hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4870)|
| 1:21:22| It's a perceived hardship that they created for themselves, not the community, not the taxpayers of Knoxville City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4882)|
| 1:21:30| But once again, back to the point, we as a neighborhood don't believe that their request for variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4890)|
| 1:21:38| meets the standards set forth by the state and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4898)|
| 1:21:42| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| I understand we're talking about the hardship issue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| But really from a safety and traffic common sense standpoint, it just made a lot of sense really to line up to Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4905)|
| 1:21:54| Mr. Seymour, when this has already been approved, including phase two for 550 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4914)|
| 1:22:04| and then the other road over there is McHenry or McCamey or McCampbell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4924)|
| 1:22:12| And so there's another entrance plan for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| Where does the developer see the majority of the traffic exiting the development to go back towards 640,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4936)|
| 1:22:24| which is off Washington Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| I mean, would they go out McCampbell Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| Well, phase one, you will go out Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| And if you're going west, you'd go right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| If you're going east, you'd probably go left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| I wonder when it was changed to get this easement and why, rather than the original plan to go through the church property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4959)|
| 1:22:47| Well, as I understand, the church property is not available for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| I was not involved in earlier discussions on this, so I cannot answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4972)|
| 1:23:00| I don't know if, Beth, can you answer it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| And, Harold, do you know the answer to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| The initial traffic impact study, which was done in December of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| at this location is the sole entrance point, and the entrance before you is what was proposed under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=4997)|
| 1:23:25| The developer asked us to look into the opportunity to tie into McCampbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5005)|
| 1:23:32| They were pursuing that at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| This was back in, I want to say, January or February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| We then received notice once that traffic impact study was completed that that was not an available option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| as they had thought that the church would not provide that access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| So the traffic impact study was again revised to reflect this phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5029)|
| 1:23:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| Well, as we all realize, we postponed this for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| because the concern was that council members had not had the opportunity to visit the site and consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5043)|
| 1:24:11| I had been there quite some time ago when it was previously before us, but had not been back recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5051)|
| 1:24:19| and did take the opportunity before I left town to drive out there on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5059)|
| 1:24:26| I don't really want to get into the debate about the legal ramifications of it meeting the variance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5066)|
| 1:24:33| because really what's before us tonight is the decision, in my mind, on what is best for this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5073)|
| 1:24:40| This development is going to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| I've spoken to people who have assured me that it's going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| And having been there and having driven the entire perimeter of the property, without a doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5089)|
| 1:24:56| this is the most, as Councilman Bailey said, sensible access and egress area for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5096)|
| 1:25:08| I'm concerned about the safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| In my mind, I can't get beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| The preamble in the charter under which we are to act reminds us that we are elected to serve the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5115)|
| 1:25:25| and to take care of their safety and welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| And I absolutely feel that this is the only safe area in which people can approach that property and leave that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5129)|
| 1:25:41| Sitting across the street in the condo development there and looking at this area and watching traffic move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5141)|
| 1:25:49| it just appears to me that it is very fortunate that the developer is going to bear the cost of the turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5149)|
| 1:26:01| and prevent a stacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| It's very, very heavily traveled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| That was on a Sunday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| So having that turn lane is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| I think the developer being willing, they apparently understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5172)|
| 1:26:17| Mr. Cannon has advised them that that turn lane is crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| I think that is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| I believe that the turning into this development will probably be accomplished safely for everyone involved with one lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5183)|
| 1:26:33| But I do believe that if people are going to pull out of the development onto Washington Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5193)|
| 1:26:40| that it's just necessary to have the two lanes so that it won't be stacked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| and so that people won't make sudden, darting decisions to plunge across a lane of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5206)|
| 1:26:54| in order to make their turn left if they're going east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| And then they will be in position to make a reasonably timed turn to go back toward Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5218)|
| 1:27:06| So in my mind, it's my obligation to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| I feel that when traffic engineers, and I talked to Mr. King today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| and Mr. King, you assured me that you support the recommendation that's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5237)|
| 1:27:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| This came before BZA and engineering supported it, although engineering did not require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5248)|
| 1:27:36| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| And I attended the BCA meeting, so I have heard the discussion previously at BCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| And I appreciate the point that the neighborhoods are trying to make here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| but I feel it's my responsibility to be most considerate of those traveling on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5269)|
| 1:27:58| And until those improvements occur out there, I think this is crucial to the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| and to the expeditious traveling of Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| So I'm going to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Quick question, Mr. King, on safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| We heard a lot about turning movements when we were dealing with Gibbs Drive a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| And I just want a couple quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| Is it your opinion as a traffic engineer that two exit lanes are safer than one in a situation like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| I mean, it seems like traffic backing up might aggravate people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| but if you've got two lanes, you've got somebody turning right whose view is blocked by somebody turning left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| Is a two-lane driveway always safer or a three-lane safer than a two-lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5322)|
| 1:28:48| Well, I think that, speaking for the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| it will make access to leaving that property easier with a dedicated left-turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| That way a one car will keep people from turning right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| Now, whether or not that becomes a safety issue, that would require some analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5347)|
| 1:29:18| I think it's Mr. Cannon's opinion that it is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| Obviously the city's requirements at this point do not require that left-turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5363)|
| 1:29:31| Obviously we didn't object to it if the developer chose to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| But just on safety, you're saying this is one, could be six one-half dozen of another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| If another traffic engineer were to say to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| I studied this and it is safe for having two lanes coming out, you'd say, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| But, you know, if they said it wasn't, you could believe that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| I think the reason we have the requirement for the major traffic generator is when the traffic gets that heavy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5392)|
| 1:30:00| it kicks in those additional laneage, and I think that makes some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| Now, if we wanted to really make this entrance safer, again, going back to Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| wouldn't a right in, right out be a whole lot safer than any kind of left turn either in or out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| Isn't that safer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| It would be safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| It would make access difficult, but it would be safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090519?start=5422)|
