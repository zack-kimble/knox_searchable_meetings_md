| 0:01:05| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| We do have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| At this time, I will recognize Commissioner Hill for tonight's devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=71)|
| 0:01:12| And let me just say, Happy New Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=72)|
| 0:01:15| This is going to be our first devotion that we're having in the year 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| So I thought it was very important that I impart some words of wisdom here for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| This is something that I had read that I thought could possibly be some best practices for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| that we might like to consider adopting in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=94)|
| 0:01:39| And the title of it is Lessons from a Goose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| So next fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter, flying along a V formation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=103)|
| 0:01:52| you might consider what science has discovered as to why they fly that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| As each bird flaps its wings, it creates uplift for the bird immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=117)|
| 0:02:03| By flying a V formation, the whole flock adds at least 71 percent greater flying range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| than each bird if it were flying alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| Lesson number one, people who share a common direction and sense of community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| can get where they are going more quickly and easily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=141)|
| 0:02:25| because they are traveling on the thrust of one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| When a goose falls out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and resistance of trying to go it alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=150)|
| 0:02:37| and quickly gets back into formation to take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| Lesson number two, if you have as much sense as a goose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=164)|
| 0:02:49| you will stay in formation with those people who are headed the same direction that you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=169)|
| 0:02:57| When the head goose gets tired, it rotates back in the wing and another goose flies point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=177)|
| 0:03:10| Lesson number three, it is sensible to take turns doing demanding jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=190)|
| 0:03:15| whether with people or with geese flying south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| Geese honk from behind to encourage those in front of them to keep up the speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| Lesson number four, what messages do we send when we encourage those ahead of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=206)|
| 0:03:36| Finally, and this is important, when a goose gets sick or is wounded by gunshot or falls out of formation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=216)|
| 0:03:45| two other geese fall down with the goose and follow it and lend it help and protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| They stay with the fallen goose until it is able to fly again or until it dies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| and only then do they launch out on their own with another formation to catch up with their lost group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| Last lesson, if we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by each other like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=247)|
| 0:04:15| Bow, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| Our Heavenly Father, we thank you, Lord, that you have introduced us and given us the privilege to another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=257)|
| 0:04:25| I pray, Lord, that this will be the year that our families, our commission, our country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=265)|
| 0:04:34| and our world will work together and support each other and just be focused on the common good, Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=274)|
| 0:04:44| We love you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| We appreciate the freedom you allow us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| In God's name we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| I will now look to Commissioner Lee for tonight's pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| You can stand for the pledge, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=309)|
| 0:05:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=331)|

| 0:05:35| I would like to recognize our newly formed Junior Commission that is standing with us in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| If you would please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=340)|
| 0:05:50| For those of you in the audience, this is a new program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| This is the inaugural class of the Junior Commission, and these 11 were selected among 57 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| They have definitely made themselves stand out, and we are very excited to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| You will be seeing them with us for the next several months, so please give them encouragement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=366)|

| 0:32:53| The hard thing, and I think I've told you guys before, is that we are building houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| and apartment buildings at such a fast rate, we can't catch up with the people that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=1977)|

| 0:34:19| All of you have been there to visit at various points in time, and really the catalyst for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| our visit tonight was one young lady with us, Aishita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| We were conducting a tour at our club several weeks ago, actually a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| now, and the gentleman that was touring asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| And she said, I want to be a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| And I quickly said, no, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| But if you want to be in government, let me get somebody to come over and talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| And I reached out to Commissioner Lundy, and she came over to the club and spent some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| time with Aishita and just kind of talked about that aspiration and invited us to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2090)|
| 0:34:56| tonight and share an update on our organization with this group and let these young folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| kind of see what our local government looks like in action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| So thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| Boys and Girls Clubs of the Tennessee Valley, many of you know us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Some of you know us very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| We're a youth development organization that is largely located here in Knox County, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| we've got operations in five counties now, including Claiborne, Loudon, Anderson, and Blount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| But in Knox County, on a daily basis now, we serve about 1,100 kids every day after school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| We serve about 5,000 Knox County kids annually, almost 7,500 total throughout the entire region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2128)|
| 0:35:36| We provide daily after-school programs that seek to create outcomes in the areas of academic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| success, health and wellness, and good character and citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2141)|
| 0:35:44| Our mission statement truly says it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| To inspire and enable all young people, especially those that need us most, to reach their full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| potential as responsible, productive, caring citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| And I think we would all agree, if we take 5,000 kids that we're working with in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| County on an annual basis and we achieve that mission, this community is going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| to be a great place to live, work, and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| So a couple things that we do, you know, there's some key issues that I know this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| is concerned with, our region as a whole is concerned with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| Child care being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| For employers, like I said, 5,000 kids coming into our clubs on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| We're there to serve kids more than 250 days a year for more than 1,600 total contact hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2183)|
| 0:36:30| So that provides a lot of families, a lot of parents, an opportunity to work more hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| or to even just have a job that they might not have been able to otherwise or go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| to school and pursue education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Speaking of education, that's another significant emphasis for our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| Some data we pulled from Knox County Schools last year showed that kids who are attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| the club on average at least twice a week are outperforming their peers in state standardized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| testing and reading, math, and science, with science being about 48% higher proficiency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| rate overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| So we're doing a lot of great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| The 4-H folks mentioned the work they're doing in STEM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| We're doing a lot of STEM work in our clubs as well to make sure our kids are having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| opportunities and experiences to do well in that realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| Additionally, right now, we're placing a significant emphasis on early literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| We've got a great program called Rookie Readers, which focuses on kindergarten through second grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| Last year, 94% of the kids who took part in that program, it was over 400 kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| improved their reading proficiency with that program during that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| So making sure that they're doing the things that they need to to be successful students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| Next is the mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| I think everybody on this group is keenly aware of the impact that COVID has had on the mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| health of our kids, but the reality is young people were struggling with mental health long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| before COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| It only exacerbated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| We've got a program called our Member Emotional and Social Health that employs four full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| social workers, one a licensed clinical social worker that's providing individual and family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| counseling to our kids and their families to help mitigate the effects of child care trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Those are critical to making sure that kids are not falling victim long term to the effects of trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| And then last but not least, workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| We've got an amazing workforce development program called Youth Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| Last year in Knox County alone, our organization put 306 kids in paid internships following 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2301)|
| 0:38:29| hours of soft skills training and development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| 306 kids went into paid internships with business partners in this community of at least 60 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| Some kids did as much as 220 hours of paid internship work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| So when we talk about preparing that workforce for the next generation, the great jobs that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| attracting to this region, this is one of the ways that we're helping our community stay strong for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| So we've got our kids here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| All of these young folks, like I said, are at our Northridge Crossing Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| And I think all four of these kids are in a great program we have called our Youth Arts Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| And I think I've seen all four of these kids on stage at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| And we do that every summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| That's kind of one of the culminating things that we do is our performance at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| It's typically a stage play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| But I would just invite any members of the commission to come by and visit any of our clubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| especially their club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| It's a great club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| It's one of the four sites that we have in KCDC communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| And I'd be open for any questions anybody may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| I don't have any questions, but I do want to thank Bart and the young leaders for coming today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| And, you know, this is a great opportunity for them to come see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| And this is kind of cool for them, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Is this cool to be here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Can we all take a picture with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Because I know this will be a memory they will forever cherish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Commissioner Lundy, there are two more commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| I'm sorry, I missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| We'll do it at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| I wave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Thank you guys for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| Thank you, Ms. McFadden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Could you briefly kind of explain what's the process for how Boys and Girls Clubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| determine how to locate in a community or an area, you know, with a new facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| I'm honestly very thankful you asked that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| We are actually at our corporate board meeting last Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| We voted to launch a board task force to truly look at communities in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| As many of you know, we've been traditionally located kind of in the Old North Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| That's our flagship site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| We've been there since the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| The reality is Knox County looks a heck of a lot different than it did in the 1950s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2447)|
| 0:40:51| So there are pockets of this community, and Commissioner Jay and I were talking about this the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| There are pockets in this community where need exists that really no services for young people exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| especially in the out-of-school time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| So we're launching a group right now to look at that to say, hey, where do we need to be for the next 10 to 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2462)|
| 0:41:09| Can't say permanently, but where are pockets of need going to grow or where are current unmet needs right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| that we can deploy services, staff, and resources to make sure that we're taking care of those young people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Congratulations on a great event the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| I encourage next year all of the commissioners to go to the Youth of the Year event, which was awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| I got to participate as one of the judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| It was a hard thing to do, but it was incredibly inspiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| and it's a great program that you have that sort of takes leadership to another level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| I just want to make sure everyone in your group looks behind you and sees the junior commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| because I'm hoping when you're older maybe you'll apply and be one of our next junior commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| I hope the program will be around to serve you when it's older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| So thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you, future leaders, for being here and joining us tonight, and thank you for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2528)|
| 0:42:12| I had a quick question about if we have employers in our county who want to become community partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| how can they learn more about doing that, and are there any requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| We do a lot to make this easy for employers, because we realize that working with young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| especially high school age, probably isn't their forte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| They run their business, and working with high school kids takes a special skill set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2554)|
| 0:42:38| So we really work to make sure that it's easy for them and successful for them and the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| So they can simply reach out to our organization, either via website or call our offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| and we would love to talk to any businesses that would be interested in hosting interns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| and we're really excited to explore how this program is going to be able to interact well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| with the new 865 Academies initiative of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Mr. McFadden, if you wouldn't mind, would you have these future young leaders say their names in the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| That way we can make sure they are included in our minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| My name is Dominique Mack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| My name is Tyrone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| My name is Aishita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| My name is Zarin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| And now we'll be ready for that group picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2610)|
| 0:43:59| One, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2639)|
| 0:44:13| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2657)|
| 0:44:47| That concludes our presentations for the evening and brings us to public forum for agenda items only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2687)|
| 0:45:02| Under our rules, those who have signed up to speak on a particular agenda item may speak at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| We have six people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2707)|
| 0:45:12| First on the list is Ms. Linda Smith, followed by Kevin Murphy and Caitlin Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| Ms. Smith, if you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| Ms. Smith, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| I will roll to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Next on the list is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2734)|
| 0:45:35| Please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| Please state your name and county of residence for the record, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Kevin Murphy of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| I'm here speaking on the resolution that was on the consent agenda for the interstate bypass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| and I hate speaking without having options and solutions and stuff to present, but I've got just a perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| Our rivers and ridgelines are a defining feature of our Tennessee Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| We love and it draws all of us here, and that's why none of us want to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| And those same ridgelines and rivers, they influence our road and transportation design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| Roads run parallel to ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| They run through gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Kingston Pike, a couple hundred years ago, was built out, and the early road makers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| they were definitely looking for the easiest way to build a road, and they followed that natural topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2783)|
| 0:46:28| And then back in the 50s when they were laying out their interstate system, 40 and 75 also followed that topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2788)|
| 0:46:34| and we probably had some pretty smart people back then saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| oh, we can save some money by combining our interstates on this one corridor here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| So that's great, but today it's carrying a lot more traffic than anybody could imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| And meanwhile, you know, we developed out along that corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| and we kind of created a downtown commercial district, you know, that's four blocks wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| and about nine blocks long going from the Bearden area where they come together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Kingston Pike and the interstates, all the way out to Campbell Station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| So that's a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| A lot of that's external to Knox County, and that creates an issue that is not in our purview to solve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| and that's a great reason to look for a bypass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| And I don't think there's another, you know, viable option out there for a bypass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| But if we are looking at a bypass, then there's some things the commission should also be thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| as you look at other decisions you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| First, you know, once a new road project gets kind of declared and kind of cited out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| you're going to have a need for additional infrastructure from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| There will be pressure to build more roads or enlarge and widen roads that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| so that's going to create some budget pressures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| You can look at what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| You know, we did an interstate I-40, and that's, you know, there's been a lot of development along there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| including you've got North Shore Town Center, and you've got a lot more road and growth that happens out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| So it's natural that a new interstate will change growth patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| and that's really important for us to be thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| I know it takes a long time for a new interstate to be planned out and cited and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| but that's going to have a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Right now, the advance, oh, and of course, you know, with that comes our oldest American,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| well, not the oldest, but one of our oldest institutions, which is land speculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2894)|
| 0:48:20| So you'll, as commissioners, experience immense political pressure when it comes to land usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| Right now, Advanced Knox is looking at all these growth patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| and the word bypass only appeared in one of over 7,000 comments that I could find on the Advanced Knox website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| so that's not in your constituents' minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| So that's something that is going to take some rethinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| You'll need to revisit our general plans as that comes along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| I just want you to be aware of the impacts that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Bypass is probably the right, you know, the only way out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| but just be aware there will be some other things you'll need to do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Next on the list for public forum is Ms. Caitlin Jones, followed by Keith Britt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| Ms. Jones, please approach the podium, state your name and county of residence for the record, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| Hi, my name is Caitlin Jones, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Most of you know that I'm a single mom with a son with Down syndrome and autism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| and I just wanted to take the time to thank you all today for voting for Commissioner Lee's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| When I found out that I was pregnant, I wasn't in a good place in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| Half the time I wonder how I didn't end up dead or in jail, and my son saved my life 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| When I found out he had Down syndrome, the doctors, I got moved to a high-risk specialist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| and the doctors told me all the things that were going to go wrong when he was born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| He had a major heart condition, major things, problems with his intestines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| He's had Hirschsprung's disease, went through multiple surgeries and has had multiple hospitalizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| but I couldn't imagine not having him in my life, and I just appreciate anyone who is able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=2995)|
| 0:50:03| and who takes care of a child like that or any child at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| And I just wanted to also take the time to just say out there to anyone listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| if you're a mom or going to be a mom and need help in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| that I would be happy to speak with anybody who wanted to reach out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| I know that finding out not only are you pregnant, especially at a young age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| in a time when you're not ready, and that now you find out your child has a disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| that it's very difficult, and that's okay to feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| And so anyone who wants to speak with me, they can find me on Facebook, Instagram, anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| and I would be happy to speak with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| So I just really appreciate anybody, everyone who voted for this to pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| and I appreciate Commissioner Lee for bringing it forward, and I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| Thank you, Ms. Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| Keith Britt, if you would please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3049)|
| 0:50:53| Debbie Stafford and Sherry Garrett will be our next speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3053)|
| 0:50:58| Mr. Britt, please state your name and county of residence for the record, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| Hi, Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| Just to be clear, I am absolutely 100 percent a Democrat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| but I have never felt more Republican in my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| reading over the proposed lease agreement with the Concord Yacht Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| They are fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| The Concord Yacht Club, I know some of them personally, they are good, decent people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| But the plain fact of the matter is we as taxpayers are subsidizing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| through the giveaway of some of the most valuable property in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| we are subsidizing boat slips at substandard rates, sub-market rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| And I did some rudimentary, not to be taken as scientific research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3103)|
| 0:51:53| just property valuation of the property that it sits on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| and I priced it out at about $4.27 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| Based on some comparable residential lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| we could have funded the entire indigent medical program that we cut a few years ago with that for four to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3124)|
| 0:52:13| We could have given medical service to 1,000 people for the subsidy that we are giving for boat slips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3133)|
| 0:52:19| And that money comes, it does come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3139)|
| 0:52:25| There is a tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| That subsidization comes from sales tax, from food for people below the poverty line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| It comes out of my property tax dollars, which I don't mind paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| but I do like for those property tax dollars going to something that go to the general good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| Police officer salaries, I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Raise my taxes if you want to pay the sheriff's office more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| Sheriff's office employees, we cannot fill a myriad of positions for those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| so why are we subsidizing expensive boat slips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| But what if we did decide not to renew that lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3182)|
| 0:53:08| Would we do that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| That would be a major headache for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Knox County Government, Parks and Rec, I don't think wants that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Turning that into, I don't know, a dog park or whatever could be publicly accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| By the way, I priced it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| It would cost me $926 to put on that property according to their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| But we don't want that headache either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| But what I am asking you to do is look at that lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| look at who is paying for it with sales tax dollars and property tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| and are you willing to have those dollars go to subsidize below market value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| or below market rate boat slips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| So at a very minimum, make this revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Do some sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| Make them raise the slip rate to do something more comparable with the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3232)|
| 0:53:57| And just make sure that we're not making people that are struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| pay to subsidize these boat slips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| Ms. Debbie Stafford, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| State your name and county of residence for the record, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| Debbie Stafford, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| I'm here tonight in support of Commissioner Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| and all of you that voted to make Knox County a pro-life county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| I thank you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3270)|
| 0:54:32| I feel like some things need to be said about being pro-life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| Obviously, in the words of Dr. Seuss, a life is a life no matter how small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| At the same time, by removing abortion, which I'm very glad that we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| because abortion is always murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| We can try and color it any way we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| But there are a lot of things in our county that we have not addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| And most of this isn't even county, so it's more to go on public record than anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| But what happens to those women who are forced into pregnancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| who are forced to have sex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| What happens to them in their crisis pregnancies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| Since Roe v. Wade has been overturned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| I personally have seen an increase of babies come into the clinic who were born addicted to drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3312)|
| 0:55:18| Whereas those babies would have otherwise been murdered through abortion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| now they're living, and praise God for them living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| But what's happening to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3324)|
| 0:55:25| What services are available for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| What services are available for women who find out they're pregnant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| I hope that in us continuing forth a pro-life mindset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| which I think is very important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3337)|
| 0:55:39| because if a fetus is not life, then at what point does life matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| And people like Caitlin who share their story are a total beast in this world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| And I mean beast in the best way, beast mode, for going to advocate for a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3350)|
| 0:55:54| Most of you know I have a child that's disabled as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| She was actually born healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| And if I had to go back and choose watching my child suffer like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| knowing ahead of time that I would have had to watch her suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| I would have told you no, no, no, that doesn't mean I would have aborted her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| That means that we have suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3371)|
| 0:56:14| And so I don't even know what I'm doing up here talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| I just came up here to talk and to ask you all to please be mindful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| we need to have conversations with boys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| because where every baby is conceived, there was a male.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| I won't call a man, because many times these males aren't acting like men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| when they get women pregnant that they're not willing to commit their lives to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| But we need to bring men back in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| What are we doing to make sure that men aren't creating babies that they're not ready to be fathers to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| What are they doing making babies with women who aren't ready to be mothers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| So I love it that we are becoming pro-life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| but let's open the door to the entire conversation and all the things that lead up to abortion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| And the fallout of not having abortion means extra support for a lot of women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| and trying to push men into being responsible for their duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| that they should have been responsible with all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| So thank you all. Have a great night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| Thank you. And Ms. Sherry Garrett, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3432)|
| 0:57:17| Ms. Linda Smith, have you arrived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| State your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| Sherry Garrett, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| First off, thank you all for passing this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| Thank you again, Rhonda, for bringing that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| I'll start off with Psalms 139, verses 13 through 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| For you created my inmost being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| You knit me together in my mother's womb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| Your works are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| I know that full well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in a secret place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| when I was woven together in the depths of the earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| Your eyes saw my unformed body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| And I want to quote quickly from someone who said everything that I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| but she said it so much better and so much more eloquently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| This is from Mother Teresa at her acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10, 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| And I feel one thing I want to share with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3496)|
| 0:58:20| The greatest destroyer of peace today is the cry of the innocent unborn child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| For if a mother can murder her own child in her own womb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| what is left for you and me to kill each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3507)|
| 0:58:29| Even in the scripture it is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| even if mother could forget her child, I will not forget you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| I have carved you in the palm of my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Even if mother could forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| but today millions of unborn children are being killed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| and we say nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| In the newspapers you read numbers of this one and that one being killed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| this being destroyed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| but nobody speaks of the millions of little ones who have been conceived of the same life as you and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| to the life of God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| and we say nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| We allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| To me the nations who have legalized abortion are the poorest nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| They are afraid of the little one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| They are afraid of the unborn child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| and the child must die because they don't want to feed one more child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| to educate one more child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| and the child must die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| And here I ask you in the name of these little ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| for it was that unborn child that recognized the presence of Jesus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| when Mary came to visit Elizabeth, her cousin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| As we read in the gospel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| the moment Mary came into the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| the little one and the womb of his mother left with joy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| recognized the Prince of Peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| And so today let us here make a strong resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| We are going to save every child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| every unborn child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| give them a chance to be born.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| And what we are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| we are fighting abortion by adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| The good God blessed the work so beautifully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| that we have saved thousands of children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| and thousands of children have found a home where they are loved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| they are wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| they are cared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| We have brought so much joy in the homes that there was not a child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| and so today I ask His Majesty's here before you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| who come from different countries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| let us all pray that we have courage to stand by the unborn child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| and give the child an opportunity to love and be loved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| And I think with God's grace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| we will be able to bring peace in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| I want to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| I want you to love the poor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| and never turn your back on the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| for in turning your back to the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3610)|
| 1:00:11| you are turning it to Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| for He has made Himself the hungry one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| the naked one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| the homeless one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| so that you and I have the opportunity to love Him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| But where is God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| How can we love God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| It is not enough to say to my God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| I love you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| but my God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| I love you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I can enjoy this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| but I give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| I could eat that sugar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| but I give that sugar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| If I stay here the whole day and the whole night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| you would be surprised at the beautiful things that people do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| that share the joy of giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| And so my prayer for you is that the truth will bring prayer to our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| and the fruit of prayer that we will believe that in the poor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| it is Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| If we really believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| we will begin to love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| And if we love naturally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| we will try to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| First, in our own home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| our next-door neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3652)|
| 1:00:53| in the country we live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| let us all join in that one prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| God, give us courage to protect the unborn child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| for the child is the greatest gift of God to a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| to a nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| to the whole world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| This concludes our public forum for agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=3670)|

| 1:07:57| I thought the caption had actually been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| One moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| Okay, so the caption should actually read for a term of five years beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| July 1, 2023 and ending June 30, 2028.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4091)|
| 1:08:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| And then with an option to renew the lease for an additional period of five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| with an annual rent in the amount of $5,000 over their initial term of the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| Is that correct, Mr. Vandiver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| No, no option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| It's just a five-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4114)|
| 1:08:35| It's just a five-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| Mr. Vandiver?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| It's not an automatic renewal, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| It does provide an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| I don't believe it sets a rate, but it does provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| That was one item that's been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| The original item, as proposed, probably does include a default renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4127)|
| 1:08:55| So if Commissioner will recall, on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| a circulated correspondence that included the updated rate that's been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4137)|
| 1:09:04| a couple other provisions including an option to renew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| but it is not a default option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| It would actually have to be acted on by Commission at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| and I do not believe it establishes a rate for that second five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| It's open based on the discretion of the body at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| And, Commissioners, actually per our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| we need a motion before we can discuss this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| So I know it's going to be tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| The item that you just read, though, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| The way you just read it is what we're motioning on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Correct, with no option to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| It's five years with $5,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4181)|
| 1:09:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Everybody in there at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Motion to approve a five-year lease with $5,000 per year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4189)|
| 1:10:00| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| It would also include quarterly reports to Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| with metrics of measurement that the club can provide on activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4204)|
| 1:10:11| and participation, and those will be forwarded by Director Mack to Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| We also ask them to consider establishing a higher rental rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| for non-county residents who do not pay Knox County taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| And then, finally, we ask them to meet with risk management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| and their insurer to discuss if there are safe ways that public access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| to the facility could be improved and to report back to Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| on those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Motion to approve pending stipulations that were just stated by Commissioner Ward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| with a second by Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| Commissioner Ward took my substitute motion, so we're all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4257)|
| 1:11:03| Director Vanderveet, do you care to respond to Mr. Britt's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| about the deeded use of the property just to clarify any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| or concerns in his statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier, and certainly not to discourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Mr. Britt's involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4277)|
| 1:11:18| I appreciate him taking an interest in the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| I would say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I think that an evaluation estimate on the property's commercial value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4282)|
| 1:11:28| would have to consider the fact that much of it is in the floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| I'm not sure that was a variable in his calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| And as far as our operational costs, they are, in effect, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| Remember, I just always come back to the fact that what we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| the Concord Yacht Club to do is provide opportunities for people who live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| in and around Knox County that will not otherwise have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4306)|
| 1:11:50| to learn to sail, an opportunity to participate in the sailing sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| But we actually do not spend any money on this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| They cover their costs and do the work that we ask them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4318)|
| 1:12:08| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| Dwight, I guess I'm the only one that's been in opposition to the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4335)|
| 1:12:19| this lease has been written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| And again, the paperwork that is submitted in our agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| is not 100% correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| In other words, they wrote the lease, and then we're substituting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| the information that you've just presented to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| and that's what the motion says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| It would amend the terms to provide five years, $5,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| no default or automatic renewal, quarterly reports to Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| establishing a higher rental rate for non-county residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| and then opening discussions with risk management and their insurer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| about the possibility of opening the space to public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| And we've talked on the phone previously about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4381)|
| 1:13:06| but I just want to make sure for the record I understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| that Director Mack and his department is not interested at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4389)|
| 1:13:15| in expanding the access for the folks that use the Concord Park boat launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| or expanding the cove at Concord Park into a portion of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4401)|
| 1:13:28| like I spoke about last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| At this point in time, we wouldn't have the staff or budgetary bandwidth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| to take on the space, the physical space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4417)|
| 1:13:41| nor do we have anybody who's positioned to start a recreational sailing program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4421)|
| 1:13:48| to take the place of what the Yacht Club has done for all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| But we never discussed replacing the Concord Yacht Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| We talked about reducing the footprint of their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| We, again, and I do think that's captured in Commissioner Ward's amended motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| which is to start that discussion as to how public access to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| might be considered without creating undue liability for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| as we introduce people into the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| or for Concord Yacht Club who purchase commercial insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| in order to protect their own liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| This would be a different space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| For instance, Concord Marina, people that the commission just approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| people cannot wander about the docks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4473)|
| 1:14:37| We have some trepidation about what the implications of this would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| if we simply swung the gates open and said, okay, it's opened to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| That isn't to say we can't make some improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| but I can't do it between now and the end of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| So we've simply asked for some time to get the subject matter experts engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| And then would you consider this property as one of the top five Knox County assets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4499)|
| 1:15:06| That's a little bit subjective for me, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| It is a fine piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| but West Knox County is blessed with an abundance of lakefront property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4512)|
| 1:15:19| Virtually all our lakefront parks, with the exception of a few south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| are on this stretch of North Shore Dive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| So we have abundant lakefront from Cherokee Park to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| all the way to the Cove on the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| So where it falls in that pecking order, I'd be reluctant to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| I just would take note of the fact that the one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| West Knox County is not short of is lakefront park space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| And Madam Chair, I'd like to make a substitute motion after all the discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| Just for clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| this is a deed-restricted property that was given to us by TVA, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Yes, sir, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| It is deed-restricted and was conveyed by TVA to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| along with obviously the various sites up and down North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| So there's a very limited window of what we can actually do with the property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| I appreciate all the work that you've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| and also I'm glad that you were able to share with the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| that Knox County is not putting money into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| that we were under a lease agreement already with the Yacht Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| and that they have been more than willing to work with your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| trying to come to an agreement that worked for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| And I've heard from quite a few people from the Yacht Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| and I think what they're doing is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| We're able to get some more money for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| But just like you said, it's also important for people to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| when you're looking at commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| it goes into a lot more specific ways that you can appraise the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4614)|
| 1:17:02| and when you have so much under flood zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| you can't use that in that appraisal also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| I just wanted to thank you for your time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| I'd like to offer a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| I would agree with the five-year lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4643)|
| 1:17:26| I just feel that the $5,000 fee annually is not acceptable to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4646)|
| 1:17:38| That's just a personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| So I would like to amend the motion to say that the lease agreement is $15,000 per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4660)|
| 1:17:49| which is basically $65 per year for each of the 230 club members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4669)|
| 1:17:57| which is basically, for those who are mooring a sailboat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| is less than what they would have to pay for one month at some other facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4683)|
| 1:18:13| So the motion is for the five-year term, but for $15,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| $15,000, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| What about, is there a renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| The balance of Commissioner Ward's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| Everything else is included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| Exactly, just a monetary amount difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4715)|
| 1:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| So the substitute motion is for the five-year lease with $15,000 per year for the term of the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4722)|
| 1:18:53| by Commissioner Schoonmaker with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| Through my discussions with certain people, I can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| you know, it's $5,000 too little, it's $5,000 too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| so I wanted to get this discussion going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| Mr. Commodore, name and address before we start off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4755)|
| 1:19:22| Dana Dawson, Knox County, Carnes Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| Is that $15,000 scary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| It's a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| It would be a larger than 5% of our gross revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| I'm not saying that we could not adjust our annual dues to absorb it, but it is a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4776)|
| 1:19:42| It's not been a conversation for the last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4782)|
| 1:19:46| Well, how do you feel about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| It is a good piece of property, and I know that one of my other hangups was public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4790)|
| 1:19:57| It's going to take time to get that public access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| I understand that, and it could be a little bit of a tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4800)|
| 1:20:07| I understand that, and I really hoped we wouldn't have to negotiate it here in this setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4807)|
| 1:20:12| but I'm willing to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| How do I feel about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| We contribute a lot to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| We provide camp at an inexpensive rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4819)|
| 1:20:25| One of the reasons we have access to our club is we've kept our dues low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| Membership is just under $400 a year, and we've not raised our dues since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| If you factor in the cost of living adjustment that our federal government calculates every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| our dues should be more like $550, and we've still not raised them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| Now, economically, with the inflation we're getting, we're under pressure to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| So now you're going to add another $65 per year per member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| So now we're looking at around $600 a year annual dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| Well, that's a 50% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| It makes it a little less accessible to all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| Our membership has been around 230 members for over 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| There's a finite amount of people in this community, and you price it higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| I would argue that we're going to lose members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| This is discretionary spending, and now you're going to increase it by 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| if we adjust for inflation and your additional lease requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4886)|
| 1:21:32| How much does it cost for the Concord Marina per month, per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4892)|
| 1:21:36| I do not know. I don't have a boat over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'll ask you that question. You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| I was just told by the members of the Yacht Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| that if they had a sailboat docked at one of the other facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| they were paying in that $225 to $250 price point per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| and at the Concord Yacht Club they're paying about $70 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| But once again, that is us helping to make it accessible to the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| it not being so expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| We're also on the main channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Concord Marina is in a cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| Our docks, our boats take a lot of pounding from the larger motorboats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| that are now on Fort Bowden Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| It is incredibly expensive to maintain our docks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| and their lifespan is getting shorter every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| due to the amount of wave action we receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| So putting a boat at Concord Marina, you're naturally protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| We are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| So it's not completely comparable for what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| If I could make a suggestion, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| and I don't have any standing to negotiate on behalf of the Yacht Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| but I just wanted to point out that the existing lease is $1,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4968)|
| 1:22:53| and the proposal before the body is to take it to $5,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| That is, in and of itself, not an inconsequential increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| but to go from $1,000 a year to $15,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| is a pretty substantial increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| and I wondered if it might please the body to consider something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| $5,000 for years one and two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| and then 7,500 years three and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| and 10,000 year five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| and give the club an opportunity to adjust their member rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| incrementally and accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| and not come in with an increase that's from $1,000 a year to $15,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| a pretty substantial jump.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| I think if I were one of our other lessees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| or other folks at Parks and Recreation have a relationship with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| I'd look on that with some concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| Is that agreeable, Commissioner Schoonmaker, do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| Well, first, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| I gave you the floor right now, but I want it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| Thank you, Commissioner, I do appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| I never said that you had to raise the dues of the 230 members by $65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| I just said that's what it would be for every member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| unless you decided to adjust your rates for the other services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| that you're providing there at the Yacht Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| So in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| we don't want to be left with the thought that you haven't raised your dues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5063)|
| 1:24:30| because of such a good deal that you had with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| All we're trying to do, I'm trying to do is say is here in 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| that $15,000 a year to have the most prime lakefront property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| for a Yacht Club is a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| I think that's very, very reasonable, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| It's your option as far as if you want to expand from 230 members to 250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5094)|
| 1:25:00| or whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| We're not going to tell you how to run your operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| But at the same time, you guys have also been very good stewards of your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| Otherwise, you wouldn't have excess of $400,000 in reserve accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| for the Yacht Club to draw upon if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5114)|
| 1:25:18| So, you know, the Yacht Club's not operating from hand to mouth, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| You do have reserves, and I just think a $15,000 rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| is fair to the citizens of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| Good points on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Mr. Van, you know, I personally do think $5,000 is low,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| but I do like the idea of incremental increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| And if it's agreeable, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| If it's the Commodore, does that be agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5152)|
| 1:25:59| It's much easier to absorb, yes, sir, than jumping straight to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| I would be more in favor of that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| And that's one of the reasons, you know, I wanted to second it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| so we can get that discussion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5169)|
| 1:26:11| And I'm not saying $15,000 may not be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| We just need to come up with that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| But I do personally think it should be a little bit more than $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5178)|
| 1:26:35| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5197)|
| 1:26:38| I, too, appreciate everyone's comments and perspectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| from the folks who have signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| and my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| I've served on boards like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| We've had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| There were multiple opportunities for us to discuss anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| other than what has been presented to us at work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5212)|
| 1:26:55| And I personally do not feel like this is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| to renegotiate what we have put forth as a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| We have had numerous conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| There's been a lot of work put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5228)|
| 1:27:11| The deed actually restricts Knox County's use and or sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| I appreciate those comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| But, again, this is a valued community partner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5240)|
| 1:27:25| I think they deserve the respect of some foresight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5245)|
| 1:27:28| if we're going to change our ask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| And I'm not willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| I'm not willing to change the ask at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| And I hope that my colleagues will consider that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| I couldn't echo Commissioner Frazier any more strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| than what she has stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| We do need to keep in mind that because of the restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| on this property, it isn't like if they're there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| they're not there, that we have all these choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5278)|
| 1:28:02| to do things with this prime real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5282)|
| 1:28:05| But, again, I do think this is kind of a last-minute proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| that is not warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| And I will tell you, just from also a West Knox County standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| although the club is open to anyone in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5302)|
| 1:28:26| we do not want them to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| They give us something unique and different in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| what they offer to our kids and just a whole sport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| that not many counties can even hope to offer to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5320)|
| 1:28:46| So I hope the commission will strongly, strongly think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| before we just arbitrarily throw out another number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5331)|
| 1:28:55| that may or may not put a hardship on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Nevertheless, they have demonstrated their willingness to step forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| to work with us, to open up to more programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| I mean, again, I would hope that you would be very thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| about any last-moment change like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| I'm going to reiterate what Commissioner Frazier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| and Commissioner Hill said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5362)|
| 1:29:23| I don't want to be negotiating down on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| after we've already had an agreement with the Yacht Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| I think that puts them in a really bad position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| and it just didn't sit well with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| So I can't support the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| You know, you guys came to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| You worked with us, and we were trying to come up with something fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5383)|
| 1:29:49| for everybody at this point, and that's what we came to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| So I can't support a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5396)|
| 1:29:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| I'll just remind the colleagues that as part of this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| we sort of triggered a lot of work for our county team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| to start examining every piece of property we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| and every agreement we have with every nonprofit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| or organization we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| And be careful setting a precedence because almost every district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| has somebody that is using some piece of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| as a nonprofit use under a pretty favorable term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| and that could be sailing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| It could be rugby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| It could be another arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| It could be a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| It could be youth sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| Just be careful going down a road in which our entire purpose is to milk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| as much money out of every nonprofit as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| instead of determining the value of a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5450)|
| 1:30:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| Just as a point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5453)|
| 1:30:55| since we do have our junior commissioners here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| the question about whether we were going to amend a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| we already did that when Dwight Vandervee gave us this on Friday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| So we didn't discuss this in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| And then number two, no one has ever proposed that the Concord Yacht Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| go out of existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| When I expressed my opinion at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| I said a reduction in their land to give more for the Cove Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| and also for the Concord Park boat launch was all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| But I never stipulated that they should be forced out of existence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| Just to further clarify those comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| what we received from Director Vandervee was actually a response to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| request that we made at the work session for him to take our comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| and put them into a bullet point document for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5512)|

| 1:34:40| So I wanted to keep it on your all's minds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| that 62 days ago today, exactly two months ago actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| a 15-year-old girl was fired from her job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| because of the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| lying about events that occurred at McAllister's on Shod Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| Now, I hope that there's been work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| done the past couple of weeks concerning this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5707)|

| 1:35:16| so I wanted to make sure it stays on your all's minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| The public trust in the police is very low across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| And yes, that is mostly the fault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| of the police departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| When you have police departments like the Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| Office that escape accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5741)|

| 1:35:49| on personal Facebook accounts, Kimberly Glenn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| the spokeswoman for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| I mean, I don't know what to say that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5757)|

| 1:36:04| And I'm not going to quit coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| so y'all are going to see a lot more of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| and hopefully other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| But we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| So I mean, hold them accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| I mean, we've had people claim that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| didn't do anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| If they didn't do anything wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| what's the hold up on proving their innocence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5782)|
| 1:36:27| You know, get them to testify, make them come out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| tell their version of the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5792)|

| 1:36:36| and then we take it from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| If they didn't do anything wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| what's the problem with having them come out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230123-business?start=5799)|
