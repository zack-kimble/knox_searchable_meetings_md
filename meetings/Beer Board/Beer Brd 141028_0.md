| 0:00:30| When I call the name of the business who's applying for the permit, if you will come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| up to the podium and state your name and your address for the record, we'll have you down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=34)|
| 0:00:40| as having been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| Applicants who have all their paperwork submitted tonight and the permit is approved tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=42)|
| 0:00:48| can pick it up at the end of this meeting from one of those two ladies at the end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=48)|
| 0:00:52| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=52)|
| 0:00:53| Applicants who are approved pending final documentation will need to come to the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=53)|
| 0:00:58| tax office to pick up the permit once all the documentation is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=58)|
| 0:01:04| And beer board members, we're still saving trees, so if you will pass your things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| we're going to defer to another time around to the right, we'll see them again probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=69)|
| 0:01:15| next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=75)|
| 0:01:17| We have 18 cases tonight, so we have a somewhat full agenda, so we might as well get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=77)|
| 0:01:23| The first on the agenda is Bar Marley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| Bar Marley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=87)|
| 0:01:28| I can be confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| I think it's so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Bar Marley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| Oh, finger print.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Caleb Boyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| Home address is 3459 Maloney Road, Knoxville, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| Manager Gillespie has not been in for fingerprints and background check, and we do not have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=99)|
| 0:01:57| manager application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| She was supposed to have been removed from the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=118)|
| 0:02:01| We've told several people, and I'm not quite sure how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| You'd have to submit it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| You can do it by fax, or you can stop by the business tax office, or you can e-mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=126)|
| 0:02:10| Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| On the application, we put that she was a possibility as being a manager, but at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=132)|
| 0:02:19| time, we didn't think she would, so I don't know how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Do you have a substitute person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I'm the new manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| You're it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| You're it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| You're going to be there 24-7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| I mean, I've got assistants, but yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| We need the building inspection approval, and then the owner-manager application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| I mean, the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Just the manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=164)|
| 0:02:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=166)|
| 0:02:47| Mr. Wallace, I know you have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| I have a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| So, is that what we accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Just their verbal notification here to strike the manager that's on the application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| So, if it's the manager that's on there, what's the ruling, Mr. Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| Well, I think Chairwoman Palmer does have a good note, or a good comment that that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=190)|
| 0:03:18| be something, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| I think he's representing it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| That's something that needs to be put in the file for any future reference that may or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=201)|
| 0:03:30| may not come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| But if you're able to bring that with the other documentation or ...?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| Well, you would need to send, as I said, an email or a letter, fax it to Ms. Day in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| business tax office to take that manager's name off of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| Now, the building permit is another issue, and we have some council members who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| some questions, and we'll start with Councilman Grieve or Councilman Saunders, whichever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| No, I just had a question on the manager thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Did I understand you say you're going to be the manager?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| But we don't really have that, we don't have that on the record, we don't have that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| He's the owner, so that's, he doesn't have to have a manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=249)|
| 0:04:10| But still, we don't have the documentation about the other person being off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| Right, and he's going to, and that's why I'm going to amend the motion here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| The matter of the building permit, is that tied to the environmental situation that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| think we know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| I'm not real clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Yes, it's from the information we have from the Building Inspection Office, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| So, I don't know, I don't know how that might be cured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| You may have some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Yeah, no, they're definitely waiting on word from the state for the, you probably know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| a lot about it, but it's a long story, the old land use agreement that was in the old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| contract for the previous owner has to be redone, so we're in the process of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| But as soon as we get word from the state that they're going to go ahead, re-inform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| the city, and then we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| All right, but at this point, you cannot have a certificate of occupancy until this brownfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| issue is completely resolved, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Until we get word from the state that that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| We're working on a temporary agreement right now, and then a longer term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| I would like to amend Councilman Brown's motion so that we defer this to November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| That will give time for the letter to be here, and it will give time to get the things cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| out with the state on your certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| And that's a substitute motion, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| All right, you have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| All in favor of the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| All those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| Okay, now what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| All right, so November 25th, have this person's name removed, and hopefully you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| all your other issues done, and then we'll be able to issue the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=364)|
| 0:06:07| So even if it happens next week, it's forced to wait another month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| Yeah, because we only meet once a month, and so we cannot, we have to have some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=371)|
| 0:06:18| documentation, written documentation, that this person needs to not be on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=378)|
| 0:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=385)|
| 0:06:27| Bridgewater Management Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=387)|

| 0:06:50| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| We need the building inspection approval and fire prevention approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| I move we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| So when you get those two approvals, you'll need to go back to the business tax office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| and pick up the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| And could you repeat those for me, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| Building inspection approval and fire department approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| All right, the next one is the corner market on 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=439)|
| 0:07:22| We have two applications for the same address, the corner market on 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=442)|
| 0:07:29| and also Ian's Market number 2, number something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| No, it's Ian's Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| No, it's 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Okay, it's number 9 on the agenda, but it's Ian Market's 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=460)|
| 0:07:45| and they're both at the same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| We do not have any fingerprints or background for Mr. Jawani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| Ms. Day, do you want to help us out with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| And we're looking at the corner market on 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| Well, I spoke with the current owner today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| I believe it's called 17th Street Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=483)|
| 0:08:06| He told me that he did not sell the business to the corner market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=486)|
| 0:08:10| which was the first applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| This was deferred from last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| But he did sell the business to Ian's Market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| and there is written verification of that in the additional information I passed out this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| So is this null and void, the corner market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| So this corner market on 17th application can't be an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| because he doesn't own the building or own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| So what do we need to do with this, Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Someone can make a motion or it can fail for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Hearing no motion, this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| The next one is El Pulpo Loco on Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| Wild octopus, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| I'm Lori Camacho, and it's 2909 Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=545)|

| 0:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=549)|
| 0:09:11| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| We need the permit from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| Are you going to be able to get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=558)|
| 0:09:19| Yes, I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| Do I hear a motion, Vice Mayor Douglas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| So it makes the file complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Yeah, with the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=566)|
| 0:09:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=567)|
| 0:09:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=568)|
| 0:09:29| I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Tell us about El Pulpo Loco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| I'm not pronouncing it right, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| It's a Mexican bar and grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| Is it going to have good food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=583)|

| 0:09:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Does that mean the crazy octopus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Yes, it sure does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=588)|
| 0:09:49| And we have octopus, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=589)|

| 0:14:37| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| I move we accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=881)|

| 0:14:43| Mr. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| This is one of the ones that has a measurement issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Is there a church or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| I missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=891)|
| 0:14:52| So did I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| It's showing the church at Knoxville 132 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=893)|
| 0:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| I completely missed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| Do you know anything about the church of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| I think they are kind of behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| I didn't realize they were so close to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| But somehow we are applying for a wine license also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| So we should get the ABC license in two or three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Well, this is the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| You're too close to the church for a city beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| But when you get the TABC license, their measurements take priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| And so at that point we could issue you the beer permit but not until that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| So we need a substitute motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| Can I just withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| I'll withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Is there a second to that withdrawal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| I'll withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Now, I move that we defer this until you get to the November 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=952)|
| 0:16:00| Do you think you'll have your TABC license by then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| I think so, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Well, let's defer this to the November 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=968)|
| 0:16:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Mr. Frost is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| What I'd like to do, I think I've moved to defer this to November 25th, not December, November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| And by that time you'll have your TABC license and then we will be able to issue you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| Is there a second for my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Councilman Grieve, you look perplexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| You're just confusing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| That's what's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| So we'll see you back here on November 25th, hopefully with the TABC license in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| So when I get my TABC license, I still need to come back here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| You still need to come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1018)|

| 0:17:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| And if that person comes, we can consider it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| All in favor of moving this to the heel of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1029)|

| 0:21:13| Building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, and health department approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| and I think there's a measurement issue on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| This building, your banquet hall is 151 feet from the Magnolia Avenue United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| So are you going to apply for a TABC license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| I will be doing that, but I'm under the assumption that the church is not functioning as a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| but it's functioning as a, I guess, a place where they serve food for the homeless folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| So we've been trying to reach them to get a letter stating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| Well, first of all, a letter won't work because it's either within the distance or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| But secondly, I called that church today to find out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| and I got the answering machine and they have a 10 o'clock service every Sunday morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| and at noon on Monday they serve lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| So I know that the congregation has dwindled, but they are a still functioning church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| So when you get your TABC license, then you would be able to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1329)|
| 0:22:16| We'll defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| How long until you, have you applied for your TABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| When do you think you'll make your application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| I guess I'll do that ASAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| Good plan, good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| The health department came back yesterday and approved us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1350)|
| 0:22:34| I have that paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1356)|

| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Councilman Brown, this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| We really need to defer this until they get their TABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| So do you want to make a motion to that effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I'll make the motion that we defer until he receives his, I guess we defer it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| The next meeting is November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| They'll really be pressing it to have that, but maybe you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| So we have a motion to defer until November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1390)|

| 0:23:38| Now we're here to October the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| This is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| Do you want to defer it until November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Let's give them another opportunity and defer to the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| I'll make a motion for that second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1430)|

| 0:24:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| We have a motion from previous places, the Flow Brew Parlor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| They were approved on July 22nd, subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| And we still don't have the documentation apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| And we still don't have anyone here from that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| What are our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1463)|
| 0:24:24| Well, our options are to defer it once again or to just have no motion and let it die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1464)|
| 0:24:32| Extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| We could extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| He was in the office a few days ago checking up on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| but we had anticipated him being here tonight, so I'm not sure why he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1489)|
| 0:24:56| Any thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1496)|

| 0:25:01| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| I want to give them one more chance, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I'm going to make a motion we defer it one more time to November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| Is that the next beer board meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| So we'll hear this again on November 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| The next one is the Thumbs Up Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| This was approved on May the 27th, subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1523)|
| 0:25:30| They got 30-day extensions on August the 19th and September 16th because nobody appeared at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| So I don't know if it's Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down on this market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| That was too easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| It was too obvious, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Whose district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1549)|

| 0:25:51| We have not had any correspondence with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| I mean, we have mailed letters and gotten a return card, but we have had no contact from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| What did the letter say, just out of curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| It's attached to the back of your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Make it easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| Did you read your agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| Ran right into that one, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| You were just checking us out, weren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| I mean, people, the letter makes it very clear that you need to be here whether you're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| We were a little even more explicit with this letter because I had missed a couple times in saying that it was likely that if they didn't show up, they wouldn't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1585)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| We have an option to defer one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| We have an option to have no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| How many times has it been deferred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| May the 27th it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| They did not show up on August the 19th or September 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1609)|
| 0:26:54| So two times they've not been here and we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| And they've not responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| They've not responded in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| Hearing no motion, it is not extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Do we have any other beer board business tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd141028?start=1637)|
