| 0:01:21| The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth shall help you, God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=81)|
| 0:01:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| Be seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=87)|
| 0:01:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Madam Clerk, will you read our first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=93)|
| 0:01:37| Consideration of suspension revocation of the beer permit for the following establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| Highway No. 6759-9002, Oak Ridge Highway, Muhammad Sadiq, owner, second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=102)|
| 0:01:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Wolfie, would you like to give us a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=114)|
| 0:02:01| On September 12th, 2012, I conducted an underage beer sting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| It had several complaints through the juvenile court of this particular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=127)|
| 0:02:16| So I sent one of my underage in, bought a six-pack of Bud Light, lime, and changed it around a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| And waited 20 minutes and I sent another one in and I bought beer again with another, with the same clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=146)|
| 0:02:34| six-pack of Bud Light, platinum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| And so I cited the clerk twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=157)|
| 0:02:41| One incident, the second underage that went in, the clerk told her that what she was doing was illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=161)|
| 0:02:49| and the police may come in and get her just about any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| So that was her lucky night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| Wolfie, is this raceway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| would you tell me where that is, 9002 Oak Ridge Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| It's Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| The last place on the right before you get to the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Is that you, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Wolfie, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| You said you'd received complaints from juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Could you elaborate on that and tell us the nature of those complaints?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=197)|
| 0:03:20| We had four different juveniles that were not connected that had been caught with beer from either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=200)|
| 0:03:30| Carnes High School or Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| And they all told the court that the source was they'd been buying it at the raceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| Madam Clerk, is this the same owner that we wrote, had written the letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| At one point we had a first offense that we allowed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| It's a different owner, same family, a different owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=234)|
| 0:03:55| Is this the second offense for this owner, not the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| It is the second offense for this owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| And it's not, we're not counting the second offense as the second citation of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| We're counting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=243)|
| 0:04:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| The first offense for this owner was June 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=246)|
| 0:04:10| I'd like to make a motion for a $2,000 fine or a 60-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| I'd like to make a substitute motion if it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=259)|
| 0:04:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| We need to hear from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| If the accused is present, would you please step forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=274)|
| 0:04:44| And state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Henry Sadiq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| Did you say Henry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Yes, Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| You've heard the accusations from the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Did you, do you admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| Well, my understanding is that this incident occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| The cashier that was present that this occurred with, as soon as this incident happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| I happened to come to the store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| She came out crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| She said that she checked the I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| We immediately looked to our surveillance to see whether or not, indeed, she was telling the truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| whether or not she indeed checked the I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| In both the instances of the day where the beer sales were happening, the I.D. was checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=322)|
| 0:05:28| We take this very seriously, the responsible sale of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| It's some of the things that the lieutenant is informing you I'm learning firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| I did not know that the cashier said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| She gave me a totally different account of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| She has, by the way, since been terminated because I have a zero tolerance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| and particularly after our first offense, and we do everything that we can to enforce the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| and we understand we have a grave responsibility to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| I'm also very disturbed how the lieutenant is saying that there are underage people consuming alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=358)|
| 0:06:05| and claiming to have purchased that from our establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| Again, I can tell you that we take great pains to enforce the rule of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| One of the first things that we do when we hire new personnel is immediately tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=375)|
| 0:06:19| about the gravity of selling alcohol and that there's a zero tolerance policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=379)|
| 0:06:25| and that there's no excuse for selling so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| And also we go to the extent of letting them know that it can be a criminal matter in the event that they do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| Since the last occurrence, we've undertaken at our expense to upgrade our POS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| That does not allow them to bypass the ID prompt that comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| We've also installed a camera at the register that allows me to randomly audit a beer sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=404)|
| 0:06:54| and make sure that, in fact, that they are entering the birth date as it appears there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| So we have tried very responsibly to enforce the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| This particular cashier was working for us just under four weeks at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=424)|
| 0:07:12| Never had any occurrences of misconduct from her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| And as I said, as soon as this happened, she came out crying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| She said she had ID'd both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| She was IDing everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| I immediately took to the surveillance system in which I've saved a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| And, in fact, I do see her IDing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| Now, whether or not she entered the right date or the wrong date, that is under dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=451)|
| 0:07:36| Also, the fact that she made the comments that she made, I am, you know, I'm very, very disturbed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| and very, very sorry that that had to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| But, you know, I'm willing to undertake any of the recommendations that the beer board has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| And I hope that you take into consideration that what we promised to do the last time, we have done those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=472)|
| 0:08:00| We have gone beyond doing those, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| And we continue to make it a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Unfortunately, as much as I'd like to be there every time somebody has an ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| and make sure it's done right, and I know this doesn't absolve us from our responsibility, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| at the end of the day, these are the cashiers, and you hope that they would, you know, be, do their job dutifully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| and observe the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| I'd like to address the ID part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| The clerk did tell the underage to hold her ID up so it looked like in the camera that she was checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=515)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I want to go over the facts again, make sure I've got them correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| You had four instances through juvenile court where they said that they had purchased beer from this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=535)|
| 0:09:03| I'm sure that's what maybe tipped you off to maybe let's find out what's going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| I don't know that, but I'm suspecting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| And then, secondly, you actually went in twice in the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| And then at the same time you went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we suspend the license for 60 days, no fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| but we do a suspension of the license for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Is that within our prerogative, Mr. Law Director, to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| Currently, by statute, Commissioner, we are allowed to have a violator's choice of either 60 days or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=567)|
| 0:09:36| The only way we can get down to the revocation is the fifth offense within 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| Is that state law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| Oh, we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I thought we had the ability to increase the fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| It says right here, second offense for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| The only other thing violation is if it's not to a minor, then you have an option of a 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| or a $500 fine, statutorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| Well, if the law is tying our hands on this, I just want to go on record as saying that I would vote for revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| So I would hope that you take this into account, and hopefully we won't see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| But this is serious, and I don't believe that the police department is making this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| So, again, I would vote for revocation and taking your license from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| But the law says we can't, so I'll support the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| Well, the motion was for a $2,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| So do you, Mr. Hammond, do you want to retain your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| We had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| No, I'll follow Mr. Anders' lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| So, Mr. Ziergan, withdraw your motion and the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Did we have a second there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| No, I don't think we ever got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=643)|
| 0:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| So we're back to the $2,000 fine and or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| I think in the past we revoked a license for 90 days on a very similar type of situation where the habitual offender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=651)|
| 0:11:00| And I believe we were given fines in excess of the $500 and the $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=660)|
| 0:11:11| You can go up to says the permit the alternate of paying a civil penalty not to exceed 2,500 for each offense for selling to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=671)|
| 0:11:22| We had two offenses that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| No, we've had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| We had three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| Well, the other owner had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| We let him send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| This owner has had two offenses and two occurrences on one offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| This guy is habitual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| What is the maximum fine we can give him for this offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| According to what I read right here, it's a second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| It's a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Well, now, has that been changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| No, I'm reading it right here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| Because we've revoked a license before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Suspensions may be made for any violation or any provision of the article| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| or chapter shall satisfy a peer of the premises in any person, firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| or corporation holding a permit under this article or being maintained or operated in such a matter as to be detrimental to public health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| The board, in considering the suspension or revocation of a permit, shall consider repeated violations of any ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=732)|
| 0:12:20| and the state law involving prohibited sexual conduct on the premises or adult-oriented establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=740)|
| 0:12:27| We'll give you that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Where a commission revokes a beer permit, meaning up above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| it says that the revocation can be the fifth offense allows for revocation within 36 months of the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=752)|
| 0:12:42| That's statutorial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| I'm not going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=763)|
| 0:12:44| I mean, whatever we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| But that contradicts what you just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Well, one of them was to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| To a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| And this was a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| I'd like to change my motion if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| I'd like to make a motion to put this off for 30 days because I want to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=775)|
| 0:12:58| I think we can find this guy more money than the $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| and I'd like to make a motion to put it off for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Mr. Brown, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| Under this, in the meantime, if it's put off, he can't sell beer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| No, he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| He can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| He can sell beer now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| I'll be glad to research this further, but I don't see any discretion in what I'm reading here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| The only place where revocation can handle prematurely is if it's premises of adult-oriented establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=811)|
| 0:13:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| And unless it's enumerated in here, I mean, I'm not saying what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| I'm just saying what I've got before me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| I'll be glad to research it more in depth within the next 30 days and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=826)|
| 0:13:51| But I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=831)|
| 0:14:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Let me get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| Just a second, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| They may at its discretion revoke or suspend the permit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| or impose a civil penalty pursuant to B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=848)|
| 0:14:16| Yeah, and that's taking me back to those lists of charts that are enumerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| So you prefer to give this 30 days, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| If there are delinquents in paying fees or taxes or stuff like that, you can revoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| But if it's selling to a minor, it's enumerated what you can do selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| So you may have revoked in the past, but it may have been for some other reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| We suspended for 120 days and got kicked down to 90 on the third offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| What if we suspended for 30 days pending our resolution of the matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| We can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| We can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=893)|
| 0:14:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=894)|
| 0:14:55| Right now, the way the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| If we suspend it, it's done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| I mean, if we just suspend it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| You can't suspend it for selling to a minor for a second offense is what I'm seeing right here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=901)|
| 0:15:12| You can suspend or fine at their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| It's not optional for the body to suspend or fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| It says the sale to a minor, offender, the violator has a choice between either a 60-day suspension or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=921)|
| 0:15:30| For any other violation, a 30-day suspension, okay, or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| So you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| That's the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| That's the second offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| That's the second offense for any other violation, not selling to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| We've been 500 and 1,000 for the four years I've been up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| First offense to selling to a minor is 30 days and $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| At the same time, though, in a second offense for selling to a minor, you have a they have the choice between 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=956)|
| 0:16:06| and a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| However, if the second offense is a violation of something, any other thing than selling to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=967)|
| 0:16:14| you have the option of suspending 30 days or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| And it's not their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| So in the past you could revoke or suspend, but it depended what the charge was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| We're not talking any other offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=989)|
| 0:16:31| We're talking about selling a beer to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Then he has an option of 60-day suspension or a $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| You know, I'm sitting here trying to, you know, recount what happened before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| I thought the last time, and I'm going to ask Wolfie, I thought Mr. Sadiq was here on second offense the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| when we had the big long conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| I mean, he got up here and did a very eloquent job of laying out his measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| But I could have sworn that was him and not his brother right here on that offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1025)|
| 0:17:14| He could have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Perhaps the three-year period the last time he got was already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1038)|
| 0:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| For the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| So, you know, I think what we're hearing is the right way and solid way is habitual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1046)|
| 0:17:34| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| That's what we're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| I'll tell you, Mr. Sadiq, you're going to have to clean it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| or we're going to prevent you from selling beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| We're going to prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law, within our reason, within our powers and jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1071)|
| 0:17:59| I think you hear that up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| I think you've heard that from more than six people up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| So I would take this as a charge and say, this ain't going to happen again at the right way and solid way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| That's what I would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| But that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| But you can continue to sell to these kids from Carlson, Heartland Valley, and Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| or wherever else they come from, because what's going to happen is you're now the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1096)|
| 0:18:23| You're the spot now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| And you can shake your head no, but five and six offenses by you, one of your brothers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1104)|
| 0:18:33| at the same establishment tells me differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| So, you know, is this personal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Yes, this is personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| I have a 17-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| And I want it as hard as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| I want it to be against the law, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| And so whatever happens in the next 30 days, I would hope that we won't have another offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1128)|
| 0:18:59| And I would hope that you get challenged constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| I would hope that that would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| I'd be willing to put a little bit of overtime into a pot to have you get challenged constantly on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1144)|
| 0:19:11| So, again, it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| I think all the balls are in your court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| The law's on your side on this one, sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| But, you know, good luck playing that game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| It's a dangerous, dangerous game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1163)|
| 0:19:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Mr. Sadiq, I'll let you respond if you want to here in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| If we suspend it for 30 days, can we direct Wolfie to hit it once a week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1171)|
| 0:19:42| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| Because Wolfie works for the sheriff, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| The motion is to defer this issue for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Mr. Sadiq, would you like to say something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| You know, I can't impress upon you how disturbing this is to me as it is to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| We are a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| We're in business to do business according to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| And we understand that sometimes we have to put this in the hands of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| Now, the most startling fact I got here is that there are underage people consuming alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| that they say was purchased at Raceway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| And I also want to bring to the board's attention that the last two times there was a sting that we were successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| And we have undertaken to enforce all the measures recommended by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| And the record can go to show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| and we have the letters at the last two occasions since the last offense that we have complied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| This could be an incident, and I request you to look at it from that standpoint, that it was this girl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| that this cashier that unfortunately was abusing and misusing her position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| And it was – I don't want this isolated incident to be a reflection of the way we do business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1255)|
| 0:21:04| It's very troublesome for me to say that we are a habitual defender because –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| and I understand that, you know, the violations are there, but it's not the culture that we enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| It's not the rules and regulations that we enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| You know, and we – as I said, I welcome every day for law enforcement officials to come to the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1280)|
| 0:21:27| and see that we do take this responsibility very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| And number one in our employee rules and regulations that all the employees sign is this anecdote regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| responsible sale of alcohol and tobacco products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| So I just want to, for the record, state that as much as I understand the perception based on these violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1300)|
| 0:21:49| it's not the business that we run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| And we work hard every day, and we're there every day to ensure that there's a responsible use of our license to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1311)|
| 0:21:59| You know, I'm not sure if those – the minors that they necessarily purchased it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| or it was purchased by somebody else and somehow given it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Either way, I'm going to take that very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| and I'm going to have a discussion with all the help and let them know that even if they think that there's somehow a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1330)|
| 0:22:16| minor connected to the sale that we undertake at our discretion, a zero benefit of the doubt policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| So I can promise you and assure you that as much as we've been taking this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1342)|
| 0:22:29| that we will continue to, you know, enforce things in a very rigid manner when it comes to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1349)|
| 0:22:36| And I apologize, and I know that, you know, this is the second time that I'm making this apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| And as I said, if I could be there at a 24-hour store every day of the week to check the licenses myself, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| Unfortunately, we're in a position where, you know, that that can't be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Thank you, Mr. Siddiq.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| I think this interrogation is going to have an effect on you and your policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| and possibly some process that you have with these individuals that have this opportunity to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| And I don't understand how an individual like that that's faced with a criminal charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1388)|
| 0:23:14| and some very serious consequences to them personally that hang with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| and can stay with them cannot recognize the danger that they're in of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1400)|
| 0:23:26| And I think that emphasis on your part verbally and in writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1406)|
| 0:23:29| and whatever process you have could have a dramatic effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| I would just like to withdraw my second to Brad Andrews' original motion so that he can go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1415)|
| 0:23:42| with his second motion that Sam seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| So the motion before us is a 30-day deferral, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1432)|

| 0:25:15| sale, manufacture, transportation of intoxicated liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| As far as I know, we don't have any law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| Has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| I mean, yes, we are selling beer, but not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=1528)|

| 0:36:18| Mr. Foreman, I'm sorry to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| We're actually we already applied for the rezoning with the Metropolitan Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| so that's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| I think we just found out about it just a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2188)|

| 0:36:35| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| You know, really, we have two choices here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| We could either defer deliberation on this until the zoning's changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| or we could go ahead and pass this pending approval by the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| and pending approval of a successful change in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| I wonder if it might not be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I hate to go through this whole thing again just to wait until we get the zoning changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| But it might not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Well, that's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Well, it won't happen if they'll get a license either, though, if we go ahead and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| No, no, but the zoning change might not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| What I'm saying is if the zoning change doesn't happen, they won't have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| Is that a motion, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| I'll tell you, just because we've been through this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| is I'd make a motion to approve pending approval by the Health Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| and pending successful changing of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2251)|

| 0:38:30| And let's hold it here for just a minute so we can get back on schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| and we'll go into rules committee here in just a minute without getting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| and roaming around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2319)|
| 0:38:51| Mr. McKenzie, Mr. Hammond, Mr. Smith, Ms. Royals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| Is Ms. Royals back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| And Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| Will the rules committee have a seat, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2344)|
| 0:39:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| The rules committee, we're ready now, and we really just got two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| First, we need to elect officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| So do I hear a motion for chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| And keep in mind that we've got these rules about one officer per committee, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2369)|
| 0:39:37| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| I nominate Commissioner Hammond as chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| I have a nomination and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Any discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| I want to hear his platform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| I move that nomination cease and said name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Can we nominate or can we elect our nomination by acclamation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| So that's done without objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| Mr. Hammond, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| Would you like to conduct the vice chair and the secretary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| I can, yes, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| The floor is now open for nominations for vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| Do we have a nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| I nominate Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Mike Brown, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| I'll have to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| If not, do I hear a motion that he be named vice chair by acclamation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2427)|
| 0:40:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| So Mr. Brown is our vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| We need a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Do we have a nomination for secretary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| I'd like to nominate Amy Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| Any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Ms. Burles is our secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| First item on the agenda, Commissioner Norman, would you like to explain to us your change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| in the rules of the commission regarding committee structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| In our discussion with the law director, we've in this we've really needed a review of our rules package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2459)|
| 0:41:06| as a document based on which we've never really done from the time when we had 19 members down to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| So the law director, Ms. Rossberg and Mr. Buch have reviewed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2474)|
| 0:41:21| And you've got a draft document in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| And so the rules committee has homework for next month to review the draft document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| So we'll bring that back and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| And the chairman can set up a meeting for the rules committee to have comments on that draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2494)|
| 0:41:43| We'll set it up around either the workshop or the main meeting so that when we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| and just set it around that time, if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| So do I hear a motion that we defer this until next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| So it is on the agenda for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| And, Commissioner Norman, what about number four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| That will take care of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| So both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| So is there a motion we move this one to the next month as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| And before you adjourn, there might be one additional wrinkle in the rules, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| in the committee composition that I'm talking to a couple of people about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| CTAS had some comments about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| And so there might be something that I offer during that meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| We're now going to enter into the public forum part of our October County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| So I'd like to call that to order, all of those that are enjoying our back part of our room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| and our beautiful vista.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Okay, public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| The public forum is starting, and we have several people signed up mostly for voter ID information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| or information on voter ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| We also have some folks that are signed up for the issue of the Bob Gray Road and the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| So I'm assuming that you will be waiting to that item, to hear that item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| So I'll hold off your comments unless otherwise noted until that part of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2590)|
| 0:43:18| The first person for our public forum on voter ID is Jennifer Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| Thank you, Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| And if you would, you state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| My name is Jennifer Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I live at 4140 Whistler's Way, Apartment 411, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2615)|
| 0:43:45| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| I am the director or council organizer for the Knoxville Chapter of Move On Political Action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2626)|
| 0:43:53| I also serve as a regional organizer for East Tennessee, covering the areas from Chattanooga to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| I'm here today as a collective representing voices from Knoxville and across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2641)|
| 0:44:08| My council delivered a petition to your office as our formal complaint against the current voter ID laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| We are here today to ask for a resolution in support of ending the restrictive voter ID laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| and we ask that the Knoxville County Commission stand behind our petition to the lawmakers of our great state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2662)|
| 0:44:30| Initially, we presented our case to the Knoxville Election Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| and we were told to make a formal complaint with the law director who directed us to this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| We are advised to ask left-leaning commissioners to support our endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| However, we find the case for civil rights not to be a partisan issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| and we have held our complaint silent with a desire to ask the entire Knox County Commission to consider our request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2691)|
| 0:44:59| We have rallied, petitioned, held community town hall meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2699)|
| 0:45:04| and met individuals who are directly affected by House Bill 007 and Senate Bill 0016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2704)|
| 0:45:14| The Knoxville Council of Move-On Political Action began a petition in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| against the voter ID laws enacted in January of this year, an election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| And we currently have 7,000 signatures statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| The voter ID laws require photo identification at the polls, as I am sure you are all well aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2730)|
| 0:45:37| and have seen on the local and national news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Certain swing states, such as Pennsylvania and Texas, have been able to hinder their impact on the elections this November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2740)|
| 0:45:50| But as many orators have demonstrated in civil rights speeches in our nation's past, we must take the fight home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2750)|
| 0:45:58| Every vote is a sacred right ensured by our Constitution, the 15th Amendment, the 19th Amendment, the 24th, the 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| and, of course, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| With that being said, I am not here to lecture this well-educated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| and laudable commission on the history of our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| I am here to speak and petition my local officials for a resolution upon hearing and understanding the outcry of Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2780)|
| 0:46:30| My points are going to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Voter ID laws are creating and will create voter apathy in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| We find voter apathy unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| We find these laws to be discouraging and a direct violation of every American civil right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| Our efforts are nonpartisan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| However, the authors, sponsors, and supporters of voter ID laws have enacted them in a manner of politics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2814)|
| 0:47:02| with the intended goal to disenfranchise voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| Provisional ballots are not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| They are yet another hurdle put into place to discourage voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| We should all be encouraged to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| I have not made mention of the creation of a poll tax authored by our lawmakers on the taxpayer's payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2837)|
| 0:47:26| It costs money to buy documents required for the acquisition of photo identification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| whether that ID may be provided free of charge or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| In certain instances, the documents required for photo identification may not be attainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2857)|
| 0:47:44| Provisional ballots impose a citizenship test on American citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2864)|
| 0:47:49| and this is in direct violation of our civil rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Citizenship tests are much like literacy tests, and we all agree that was a shameful condition during the Jim Crow era.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2873)|
| 0:48:04| The other option presented by voters without photo ID is an affidavit of indigency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| Typically, this is the name of a formal document filed by a requester, usually the defendant in a criminal case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| stating his inability to pay a fee associated with his case because he is unable to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2899)|
| 0:48:27| Indigent people are called so for having little or no income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| Voters may sign an affidavit of indigency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| Ms. Wallace, normally we allow five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| There are several other people who are going to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| If you would, if you could bring this to an end shortly, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| I just have just a few more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2931)|
| 0:48:52| Voters may sign an affidavit of indigency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| and will be given a paper ballot if they do not have the money to pay for all of the proper documents needed for identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2935)|
| 0:49:03| We also find this unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| I cannot imagine that it is the wish of this commission for any person in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| or in the state of Tennessee to sign an indignant document in order to cast a ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| This will create yet another deterrent within the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| Voting should produce emotions of patriotism and pride for taking part in the history of your country's electoral process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2962)|
| 0:49:30| Voter I.D. laws alone could disenfranchise 25 percent of African-Americans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| 16 percent of Latinos, with the very old and the young most threatened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| I ask the commission to work with the collective on a nonpartisan basis for the removal of barriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2983)|
| 0:49:51| excuse me, to the ballot and to restore functional democracy with fair and just elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2991)|
| 0:49:59| We should ensure ballot integrity because the sacrifices have been made, and we should honor those sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| Thank you, Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| The next person signed up is Jessica Magers Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| I have a question for Ms. Wallace before she leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Hold on just a second, Ms. Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Ms. Wallace, we have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| Thank you, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| When you go to Belch to buy something and write a check, do they not ask you for a photo I.D.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| What about if you go out of the country?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| Do you have a passport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| Does it not also require a photo I.D.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3043)|
| 0:50:43| Well, then, why should you not have one to do one of the most important rights that an American citizen has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| and that's to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Well, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York Law School has estimated that over 21 million Americans live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| and function without photo identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| I disagree with those figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you, Ms. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Okay, Ms. Rankin, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Your name and your address in five minutes is the length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| My name is Jessica Majors Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| I live at 504 Cedar Top Lane, Unit D, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3075)|
| 0:51:24| I'd first like to say thank you very much for providing this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| It is an honor I don't take lightly to be able to speak in a public forum such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| I think it's a very important part of what it means to be an American citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| I'm here in support of my colleague, Ms. Wallace, in discussing voter I.D. laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| and I want to speak specifically to the rights that we hold as citizens of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| and as citizens of the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| We have an incredible history in this state of encouraging votes, encouraging suffrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| It's because of the state of Tennessee that women such as myself have a right to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| and that, too, is not something that I take lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| I would encourage the commission and anybody else involved in the decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| to take seriously the petition that is being presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| and all of the issues up for discussion on all sides in regards to voter I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3136)|
| 0:52:21| I think it's essential that we work to be proactive in our efforts to encourage our citizens to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| It's what, you know, we have fought for as a nation at home and abroad for so many centuries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3148)|
| 0:52:35| the rights of democracy, and being able to participate equally regardless of race, gender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| religion, or anything else is the absolute most fundamental right that we can give to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3162)|
| 0:52:49| And so I would encourage everybody to engage more in this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| to find ways to be positive and proactive to get everybody to the voting booth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| to the polling place, whatever they may choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| Thank you very much for your time, and I appreciate all the hard work you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| Thank you, Ms. Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| Next person is John Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| Your name and address, Mr. Mayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| John Mayer, 3128 Magnolia Avenue, Apartment 122.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| I'd like to start by addressing Mr. Smith's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| I offer rather flippantly that we have to have a photo I.D. to buy something at Parksville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| I don't have to have a photo I.D. I use a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| That's Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| Commissioner Brown's remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| And he's carrying, he's packing, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| I've got to pull the vest on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| When I go to Parksville, when I go to a store to buy something, when I go to the gas station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| I do not need a photo I.D. I've never been asked for a photo I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| I voted for many, many, many years without a photo I.D., and the nation did not collapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| And sometimes I'm called upon to pick up narcotics for a friend of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| They don't ask me for a photo I.D. to pick up narcotics, even though I'm obviously not a female.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| At least I hope that's obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| The many, the whole photo I.D. thing is designed to correct a problem that does not exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| I think the last statistics I read were approximately one example of an in-person voter fraud nationally per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3259)|
| 0:54:28| But by trying to correct a problem that doesn't exist, we're creating a very big problem for lots of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| And it's obviously, it's obvious to anyone who considers it logically that this is nothing but an attempt to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| on the part of certain advisors to the GOP, cold-blooded, calculated, and sly to repress the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| And I know that many people that the GOP leadership or certain members of the GOP leadership, it's not the GOP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3289)|
| 0:54:55| I used to know, have said, what's the big deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| You just hop in your car and get your, tell your chauffeur to bring the car around, run over to Strawberry Plains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| and take your picture and get your photo I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| But it's not that easy for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| And it's just a case in point how Ms. Wallace and I and several other people helped a lady apply for a photo I.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3308)|
| 0:55:16| to vote for the first time in her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| She was born without any limbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| She has one foot that extends almost directly from her torso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| To get her photo I.D. was a huge undertaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| and I didn't really appreciate the full magnitude of the obstacles until I started trying to help her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| She had to send away to South Carolina to get her marriage certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Other papers she had to send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| They all cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| I think the marriage certificate cost like $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| The day that we were signed up to take her to the voting place, her wheelchair weighs close to 300 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| We can't just pack it into the trunk of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| So I was able to get her down to the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| I called up these voter MVD and asked them if they had wheelchairs available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| They do not have any capabilities for people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| So I had to go at my own expense and rent a wheelchair from Lambert's in Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| and meet the group there that was with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| Then wait our turn in the wheelchair until she got back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| And she paid $9 for the car itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| That was approximately $30 some dollars that one day, not counting the cost of her certificate and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3380)|
| 0:56:26| So this obviously is a big obstacle for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| And I'm sure that many of you are saying, well, that's a very unusual and exceptional case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| And, yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| She had people there to help her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| A lot of people don't have anybody there to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| Next, Brian Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Can I have your name and address, Mr. Stevens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Thank you, Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| My name is Brian Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| I live at 1200 Highland Avenue, Apartment 30, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| And I am a lecturer at the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3415)|
| 0:56:59| And I work hand-in-hand with students every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| And what I mean by that is I have ink all over my hands, some from writing Sarah Palin notes before I got a sheet of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| But you know the students very well when you work at Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| And you hear their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| Just this morning, there was an article in the Tennessean where students were wondering about this issue I'm about to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| Because I was helping some students register to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| During the final days, students needed to know where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| We had to go and make sure they had IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Because as they found out, their student ID, which I hold in this hand, would not let them vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| And so one of the students told me, as mentioned earlier, they said, I do not want to plead that I do not have the funds to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| Because we needed to get her a photo ID, and I eventually gave them money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| Because she didn't want to sign the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3461)|
| 0:57:43| She didn't want to say, I don't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| But she didn't have the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| We all have money to a certain extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| But, you know, some of us don't want to admit that we have that little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3469)|
| 0:57:54| And when people are deciding, do I want to vote or do I want to maybe save that money, that's not a decision we want these students making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| We want to show them that democracy is the most important thing in our country and that they should be out there voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| not making a decision about should I be voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| But it gets even worse than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| Because you look at what just happened to me about 20 minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| This is a true story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Twenty minutes ago, I went to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| And I pulled out this ID, which you'll see is almost exactly the same as this ID over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3498)|
| 0:58:26| I have the one from when I was in graduate school in my left hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| And I have the one as a university faculty member in my right hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3508)|
| 0:58:31| And if you can spot the differences as I cover up the slight differences, there are none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| And now there's very few differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| They come off the same machine handed to you by the same person, same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| I could be in line behind a student and they could hand me an ID and a student a different ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| And I understand that I am a university employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| I'm a state employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| But don't we have voter rolls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Don't we have lists of registered voters so that when a student walks in and they're a registered voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| and they hand this ID with a picture on it, they would find this very hard to copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3539)|
| 0:59:03| If a student wants to spend two days making up this ID to copy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| voting is much more important to them than I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| And I'd be proud of how important it is, but no one should ever break the law to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| I will go on record saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| But you look at the barriers we put in place for students because some students don't have licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3554)|
| 0:59:20| These students range from 18 to I've had students older than my parents, which not that young anymore, I wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3560)|
| 0:59:29| But with this in mind, some of these 18-year-olds don't have licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| There are students who go to UT who are 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| They don't have licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Their access to a photo ID is through a university ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| And I spoke to Representative Joe Armstrong, and he told me that they were trying to put in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| that students would be allowed to have a photo ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| There's been a lot of mention when you go and write a check, when you go and get on an airplane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| Well, when you go and get on an airplane, they will accept this ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3592)|
| 0:59:55| So I want to make clear what is going on with the agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| Some of you may know I've been venturing into the political world, and I've seen a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3598)|
| 1:00:03| I've seen agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I've had people tell me how I should think and what I should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| And there is an agenda here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| And when Representative Armstrong put out there that students should be allowed to use their ID to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| and he was told no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| You wonder who's being disenfranchised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| You wonder who they're trying to stop from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| And you wonder if that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| And so maybe this whole voter ID law doesn't need to be considered as one element, but multiple elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| So I ask, if you question me, which I would like, that you question me on the aspect of how students are treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3629)|
| 1:00:37| Because if you think that's fair, I think we might have a disagreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| Thank you, Mr. Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| Seeing none, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| This is the end of public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| As far as I know, is anyone else wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Let's take five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| So we'll start back into our regular session at 215.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3658)|

| 1:01:27| Mr. Anders is having our devotional today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah, I was going to have a family member who's in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month who's a survivor come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3691)|
| 1:01:41| but I failed to get a hold of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| But I do want to honor that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| And as we remember what this month of memory has been and what it means to the people in our families, let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| Father, we thank you for the many blessings of being an American and living where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| And we thank you for the beauty of East Tennessee and allowing us to serve as a body of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| I pray that you'll just be with this meeting and help us to make decisions that benefit the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| and not just the single people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3729)|

| 1:02:18| I pray that you'll continue to bless us as a county and a country and as our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3738)|

| 1:02:35| And, Mr. Owen, will you lead us in the pledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3757)|
| 1:02:37| Everybody please stand and give the proper salute to our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3757)|
| 1:02:43| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3763)|
| 1:02:50| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3770)|
| 1:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| Approval of minutes from the previous meeting, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3795)|

| 1:03:19| And amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| I have two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Are we ready, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| On amendments to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| the first item to be added is the spread of record, which is the chair's appointments to the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3809)|
| 1:03:39| There's nine commissioners that are on this edition and spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3819)|
| 1:03:48| And then item 114, which is to have the chair serve as the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3828)|
| 1:03:56| serve on the board of the Tennessee County Commissioners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| So we'll take that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| Other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3852)|
| 1:04:13| At the commission launch, we were going to have something from the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3853)|
| 1:04:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| I've been unable to locate the property assessor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| No, I'm joking there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| In case he would like to make whatever presentation he was going to have at lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3867)|
| 1:04:31| if we are through early this afternoon with other business, I would reserve discussion time for Greenbelt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3871)|
| 1:04:41| If there's time available before zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3881)|

| 1:06:12| Clerk, we're now to the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Could I make a comment about I didn't take an item off consent because I supported it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| I just wanted to say focus a little attention on 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| About a decade ago, news items came out about a sidewalk at Bearden High School and how much people wanted one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| And this is just a finally worked itself through the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| The county paid it, fixed it from Gleason to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| Chatters went in and fixed it from Kingston Pike about 100 yards up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| And now the city is stepping in and spending a minimum of $173,000, maybe $200,000 to finish a little about 600 feet of a sidewalk from Kingston Pike up to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4008)|
| 1:07:00| So I just wanted to give the city a little bit of credit also because, as we know, city taxpayers are county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4020)|
| 1:07:08| So with the final, at least a decade, which predates any of us being on commission, people were asking for this sidewalk and it's finally going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4028)|
| 1:07:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4036)|

| 1:11:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| And second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| Opposed? Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4303)|

| 1:11:57| We do need a motion to approve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| And we had some of the --just by the way, some of the discussion that will take place over the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4320)|
| 1:12:10| the draft of the rules changes, which has been, which is before the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| is also related to standing committees and to be discussed in Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| But nevertheless, that will be taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Resolution 111 is ratifying the reappointments of Captain Tom Cox, Elaine Davis, and May Kilbrew Mosley to the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4356)|
| 1:12:44| Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| On this particular item, of course, we had a pretty vibrant discussion in work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4368)|
| 1:12:56| And in actuality, with discussion with the law director and deputy law director, this is essentially a spread of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4376)|
| 1:13:05| and we need to make note that it is a spread of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4385)|
| 1:13:09| Now, I think, and this is, of course, up to the decision of the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4389)|
| 1:13:16| I think maybe the most efficient way to handle this might be for the body to act in a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4396)|
| 1:13:26| possibly in the next month to form a committee to study the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4406)|
| 1:13:31| and the constitution of the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4411)|
| 1:13:35| Obviously, we had some significant complaints, and those were heard on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4415)|
| 1:13:41| and we had quite a round of discussion related to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| There's several of us in particular that probably should serve on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| The chair has the opportunity to form an ad hoc committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| So I think that's where we are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| It's basically there's no need for us to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| But to see this is a spread of record and it is for our information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4444)|
| 1:14:10| So I'll open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Those are my offers on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4452)|
| 1:14:22| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| I was going to say, do you need a motion to approve this as a spread of record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| Mr. Law Director, do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Since it was put out as a resolution and it has been changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| it wouldn't hurt to support the position that it's a spread of record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| because it's written to you all as a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| I'll go ahead and make that motion then since we need to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4483)|
| 1:14:46| but also very much like the idea that you form an ad hoc committee, Mr. Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| to take a look at the ethics make-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| And I'll make that as part of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| And we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Any other, Dr. Briggs, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| I don't want to belabor this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| I agree exactly with what Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| And maybe what you could do is think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| I don't know if you can contact us individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| but this may be something that we could decide at the workshop next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| and then be sure we get members on this ad hoc committee that are interested in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| and that will attend and will serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Is that suitable with the body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| We take it up at workshop next month to form the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| I know Ms. Brolls is not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| and I think she was one of the significant participants in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| Is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| Without objection, that's what will take place next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4549)|

| 1:15:51| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| We have one nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| One opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4560)|
| 1:16:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| The next item is on Page 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| It's Resolution 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| It's appointed an individual to the Knox County Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4572)|
| 1:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| Now, commissioners know the process probably better than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| but let's go through it a little bit again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| We'll have, according to our rules, a roll call to nominate a person in this to serve in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4588)|
| 1:16:39| So let's go through that process first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Roll call and we'll start in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4602)|
| 1:16:47| To nominate for to take the remainder of the term of the commissioner that's now resigning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4607)|

| 1:17:30| Do we remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Does anybody have the notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I left my notes at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| The six people that showed up that were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| I think I've got them circled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| Can we put them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| I'd like to put all six of the people that showed up on Monday in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| Is that appropriate, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| You can nominate them one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| You'd have to call them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| It's really appropriate for you to make one nomination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| and hopefully your colleagues can pick up the other five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| It'll be three at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4679)|

| 1:19:14| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| Let me ask Commissioner Briggs, was Steve Drevick not he was here that day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| Yeah, he was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| He's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| It was another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4764)|

| 1:20:00| Is there anyone who would like to nominate someone to the ethics committee that's in our audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4800)|
| 1:20:11| Did we, in that nomination process, get all of the names of all the people who came and spoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4811)|
| 1:20:19| I left my list at home, but I think we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| I think we did because Ms. Ceblonski, she showed up, but she pulled her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4822)|
| 1:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4842)|

| 1:21:01| Which district to start the roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4864)|
| 1:21:05| Let's start on the other end of the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| If the nominees, if there are any of the nominees here, I would like to hear two minutes from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| Any of the nominees that are, that we have just made, Griffo, Gross, Daniels, Martinez, Freelander, and Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4877)|
| 1:21:25| How many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4885)|
| 1:21:26| I see Mr. Gross is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| Are any of the other nominees here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I guess I say point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| We did not ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| We've asked them to do a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| They've come and they've talked before the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| I withdraw my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4899)|
| 1:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| According to our rules, the nominator, the nominators may speak about their nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4901)|
| 1:21:48| Nominees may speak about themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4908)|
| 1:21:51| That's one of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| So Mr. Gross is perfectly, if he's willing and wishes to, he may speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4914)|
| 1:22:05| Mr. Chairman, I thank the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| My name is Ken Gross, 12016 Butternut Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| I did appear before the ethics committee as one of the applicants for the two positions that were available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| and also for the one position that's available to be appointed by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| I spoke on both occasions that I consider this ethics committee to be very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| very important to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4946)|
| 1:22:29| I think in the wisdom of the Tennessee General Assembly, they saw because of history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| and some things that have been in the news over periods of time that there had to be ethics rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4953)|
| 1:22:38| and there had to be a committee that could afford an unbiased and fair and professional opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| after hearing the weight of the evidence to make a recommendation so it could be pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| I've served the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| I've served the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| I take a lot of pride in my ability to serve on boards and commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| and follow the rules and follow the oath of office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| I hold that near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| It's the same with the ethics commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| I've never applied with Knox County for an appointment before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| but I did for this because I feel strongly that this ethics committee is vitally important to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| and to the citizens of Knox County to make sure that we do have accountability at all levels of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| I think that any citizen that wants to bring a complaint has to have a way to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| And I think it's up to that committee to weigh that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| weigh that evidence, and make the best recommendation they can to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| I think that will give everybody in the county the opportunity to understand that it is fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| that it is right, that it is just, that we do hold our elected officials accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| I would like to serve on that committee, and that's one of the reasons I applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| I think it's a very important committee, and I appreciate everyone's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| Thank you, Mr. Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5029)|
| 1:23:50| Are there any other nominees here who would wish to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Is there any other discussion by commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5036)|
| 1:24:02| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| This pertains to the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| Is the only person that can speak on behalf of a candidate the person that nominated them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| Is that what I understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Okay, I'll have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| I was going to speak on behalf of someone, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| All right, any other discussion regarding the candidates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5057)|
| 1:24:21| Move the nomination to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5061)|
| 1:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| We have a motion to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| I do have a question on the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| Go ahead, Mr. Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| If you could spend a moment talking about the process, maybe the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| After the nominations are made, you'll have a roll call vote by individual nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5080)|
| 1:24:48| If one person in the roll call vote gets a majority vote, they're automatically elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| If throughout the process nobody actually attains a majority vote, which would be six in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5094)|
| 1:25:02| then the smallest vote getter or getters, if it's a series of ones, they will be dropped from the list of nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5102)|
| 1:25:13| And we will vote again by roll call until someone reaches a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| Yeah, that was my question, whether it's six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| It needs to be six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| It needs to be six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5121)|
| 1:25:22| And if there's six on the first round, then it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| Okay, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Mr. Chairman, do all the candidates have their photo IDs with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5141)|

| 1:26:31| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| I didn't see a question on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| I have to vote for the one I nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5196)|

| 1:26:51| Commissioner Shouse votes for Mr. Gross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| It didn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| I could have done that anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| So Quarston and Griffo drops off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5220)|

| 1:27:25| Or condolences, as we say sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5250)|

| 1:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| We need a motion to approve Mr. Gross' resolution now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5275)|

| 1:28:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Now we're on page six, resolution 408.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| It's approving the necessary right-of-way acquisitions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| the Bob Gray Road and Mabry Hood Road intersection improvements, nine tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5295)|
| 1:28:19| and the Bob Gray Road and Bob Kirby Road intersection improvements, nine tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5299)|
| 1:28:24| as shown on the Canon and Canon, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| right-of-way plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| I would like Mr. Vanderveet to introduce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| And if you would, Dwight, would you have Canon and Canon's representatives give us a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5321)|
| 1:28:52| I don't know about the length, but, you know, eight minutes or so I think would be sufficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5332)|
| 1:28:59| somewhere in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Go ahead, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| We appreciate the commission's patience with us as we work through this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| We do have staff from Canon and Canon, as well as staff from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5347)|
| 1:29:12| Just briefly, we have Rebecca Bottoms, P.E., from Canon and Canon, John Sexton, P.E., from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5352)|
| 1:29:19| Jim Snowden, P.E., from Knox County, Cindy Pianchi, P.E., from Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| and Alan Childress, P.E., from Canon and Canon, who will be giving you the overview of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5364)|
| 1:29:31| We appreciate your consideration of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| We are prepared to move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| I wish that I could tell you we had absolute unanimity in the community about moving it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| but we have done the best we can to have a robust and involved process over the period of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5380)|
| 1:29:47| that we've had these matters under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| You should have a timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| And, Commissioner McKenzie, I know you were not there during the discussion of the commissioner's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| I wanted to make sure you had both the timeline and the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| I think everybody else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| And I would just ask as you evaluate both the technical and the process questions during this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| that you keep the timeline in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| And with that, I'll hand it over to Alan and let him run through the presentation in hopefully eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5410)|
| 1:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| And also, we have several people to speak that are from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| I have Randall Carr, Norman Shaw, Hank LaForce, and Cheryl Lutke, I believe, to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5424)|
| 1:30:31| And so, after the presentation by Canon and Canon, then we will proceed with you all to come forward and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5431)|
| 1:30:41| So, go ahead, Alan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Give your name and address and so on for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Yes, I'm Alan Childers, 227 Wyndham Hill Road in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5449)|
| 1:30:55| Thank you, Dwight, for the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| In the interest of time, I'm going to move pretty rapidly to try to get this in in about the eight minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| The presentation does use some handouts as well as an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| So, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| It's going to be kind of going back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| But they're all intermingled properly on the slides that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| By now that you know, we're discussing two intersections on Bob Gray Road west of Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| These intersections are about seven-tenths of a mile apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| The problem essentially boils down to crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| Over the years, a lot of crashes have occurred here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| If you look at statistics overhead, at Mabry Hood, 24 crashes in three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5485)|
| 1:31:30| the most recent three years that we have data for, 22 of which are angle crashes, nine are injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| At Bob Kirby, 18 total crashes, 17 angle, and eight are injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| This highlights the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| So, how bad is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| Well, we can compare this to TDOT, calculate statewide average crash rates for similar intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5505)|
| 1:31:52| And if you look at the red numbers at the bottom of the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| you can see that for both intersections, the crash rates are significantly higher than the statewide average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| For Hickey, 7.4 times the statewide average, and then 14 times the statewide injury crash rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| And Bob Kirby is similar, 6.3 times the statewide average for all the crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| and 14.4 for the injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| So, this highlights how serious the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| Interestingly, at the request of the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| the county went back and did additional traffic counts and collected this additional data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| And on this slide, you see side-by-side the original and updated data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| You will note the traffic volumes actually went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5550)|
| 1:32:34| We believe that's probably due to improvements that have occurred on Dutchtown, Middlebrook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5554)|
| 1:32:39| and Lovell Road have probably taken a few people off of Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| However, interestingly, the crash data went significantly up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| We do not know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| It's possible that in the original group of data, the Sheriff's Department did not provide us with all the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| That's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| The bottom line is, we know we have a serious problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| In fact, it's much worse than we originally anticipated, as you can see by these numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| Eight average crashes per year at Hickey, and six average crashes per year at Bob Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| We looked at a number of alternatives, and I want to go through those quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| The do-nothing alternative we don't feel is a responsible alternative because of the severity of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| Something needs to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| The residents suggested intersection flashers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| The best data I could come up with from a study in North and South Carolina of 106 intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| many intersections there was no change in crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5617)|
| 1:33:40| Overall, they estimated about a 5% reduction with about 10% reduction in injury crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5620)|
| 1:33:47| Knox County has compared some of their own data, and they get similar results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| So a flasher, though, would be a tiny help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| Again, we don't feel that's enough for a problem this serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| The next three items that we looked at, multiway stop, traffic signals, and roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| Let's go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| And multiway stop, there's some manual and uniform traffic control devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| This MUTCD is a document that's kind of the Bible for traffic control in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| and, in fact, in all 50 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| It's adopted as state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| In that law, there's certain warrants that are in that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| There's certain warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| There are thresholds or numerical values of traffic volumes and other things that need to be satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| And if you don't satisfy this, it technically would not be a legal installation if you installed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| For multiway stop, it does not meet any of the warrants for multiway stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| And the best study I found, I got on the Internet and searched and searched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5683)|
| 1:34:47| Martin Bretherington with Gwinnett County, Georgia, when he took that county over as traffic engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| there were a lot of unwarranted, that means ones that did not meet the MUTCD, multiway stops in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5693)|
| 1:35:00| So he studied those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| And in the interest of time, I'm not going to read all those conclusions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| but you can see those there, problems he saw with multiway stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| In fact, his report was entitled, Multiway Stops, the Research Shows the MUTCD is Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5708)|
| 1:35:16| And primarily the main issue that he got at was that there's a lack of respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| When you install a multiway stop that's not warranted, usually there's not enough traffic on the side streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| which would be the case here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| And people lose respect for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| And they'll start rolling through the stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| Late at night, you'll hear tires squealing and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5730)|
| 1:35:34| So primarily it gets back to lack of respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| Move to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| Traffic signals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| Again, there's eight warrants in that MUTCD that you need to meet at least one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5741)|
| 1:35:46| and only one to justify a traffic signal legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| None of those warrants were met for eight-hour volumes, four-hour volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| Even looking at a peak hour, you can do it with one peak hour if it's really extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5753)|
| 1:35:57| In fact, none of them were really even close to meeting the required warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| So a signal would not be a good solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Now, I did want to show that even if you install a signal, even if you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| even though it doesn't meet the warrants, data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5769)|
| 1:36:13| this is from the Federal Highway Administration on many intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| angle crashes are usually reduced by about two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| But the rear-end crashes tend to go up and on the average a 143 percent increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| because you've got all this traffic on the main street that now has to stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| that did not stop before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| So you would get some improvement on severity of crashes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| but you still have a lot of crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| You'd create a lot of angle crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| And one of the problems with that is it backs traffic up farther than our other alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| We've got a figure for that in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| And I do also want to point out that last point there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| and we've got a slide that will illustrate this in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| In order to make a signal even come close to working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| you'd have to put in left turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| That would keep the traffic from backing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| And that's going to take the construction further away from the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| and will actually impact more properties and cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| And we'll see that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| So let's go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| This is a profile of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Now, I know you can't read it unless you've got the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| It's as if you kind of sliced the road down to the center and looked at it on the edge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| so that the shaded area is the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| And this is exaggerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| It's exaggerated by a scale of 10, so you can see the vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| It's exaggerated vertically just so you can see the grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| But on the outside in red, that's how far a traffic signal would back traffic up, even with turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| On the inside in green is how far the roundabout, using a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| This is using theoretical models that are accepted nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| On the left-hand side, which would be going eastbound, this is at Hickey Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| the signal would back it up 109 feet further and going westbound, 78 feet further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5867)|
| 1:37:53| And if you go to the next page for Bob Kirby, it's very similar, 133 feet further backed up for the signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5873)|
| 1:38:01| for eastbound and 157 for westbound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| which we believe would greatly increase the possibility of rear-end crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5884)|
| 1:38:10| Let's go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| This slide illustrates the pavement areas that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| This is Hickey Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| And with the roundabout, what you see in red is new pavement area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| What you see in yellow is if you did a signal, the turn lanes would have to go way back, as you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| So that's why we would impact a lot more properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| Property acquisition would be more expensive, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| A couple things I want to point out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| We shifted the intersection slightly to the left or to the west because we didn't want to impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5916)|
| 1:38:42| There's a house in the upper right-hand corner of the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| There's a house that's very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| We didn't want to impact that house because it's so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| The intersection was shifted to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| An additional advantage of that is it helps that curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| As you're coming out of the curve on the south, you know, to the bottom of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| you don't have to turn back as far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| It doesn't curve as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| So there's an additional advantage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| Go to the next one, which is Bob Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| We pretty much centered that one up on the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| And there's a couple of the houses on the west side, and the condos are a little bit closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5953)|
| 1:39:19| I will point out we have a retaining wall in the northeast corner to minimize the impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| And in the southwest corner, on the left side, where the condos are, we have guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5964)|
| 1:39:30| In fact, we have guardrail on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| So in the rare event that a vehicle would try to leave the road, there's guardrail proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| So we try to minimize the property impact as much as we could, but obviously there's some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| I will note on both of these, this is the paving area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| The construction, there will be some temporary encroachments a little further out during construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| but that will all be, you know, seeded back and planted and restored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5993)|
| 1:39:57| And so this is the perm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| What you see here is the permanent impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6001)|
| 1:40:02| Now let's talk roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| Roundabouts give you the best expected crash reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| About a year ago, this document was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| Studied hundreds of intersections or roundabouts around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| All crashes tend to be reduced 44 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| Angle crashes, which are the serious ones that cause the injuries, 90 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Injury crashes reduced 82 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| Fatal and serious crashes actually reduced 90 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| And I've seen several sets of data that's very similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| Roundabouts are very, very effective in reducing the serious accidents because you don't get the T-bone angle crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6031)|
| 1:40:37| You avoid those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| We've got a local example, North Shore and Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6039)|
| 1:40:41| We've got some data there and shows how before and after a significant reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| especially in the injury crashes, from four to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| So roundabouts do an effective job with crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| There's been some concerns expressed about the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| And I do want to mention the real critical issue with topography is sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| Not only as you approach the intersection, but seeing the vehicle yielding in front of you or slowing down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6060)|
| 1:41:06| it's looking across and seeing the vehicles coming from the other approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| There are very clear standards on how to evaluate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| And we've evaluated and designed for that and met all the standards that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| That's not an issue at these locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| Go to the next page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| We mentioned Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| We've already discussed Item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| I just wanted to briefly describe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| There is a method that we go through to evaluate congestion, the delays, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6088)|
| 1:41:33| how far traffic's backing up and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| And it's called level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| It gives you like a school grade scale to grade it with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| With the existing two-way stops, like it is now on the side streets during the peak hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| you have sometimes level of service D, E, and F, which is really not good at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6106)|
| 1:41:51| Both multi-way stops and traffic signals, levels of service B and C, which are acceptable levels of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| They are acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| However, roundabout level of service is A, by far the most superior operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6118)|
| 1:42:03| Traffic will flow smoothly with very few delays and stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| And also, we believe, although there's some public issues at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| the North Shore Concord experience taught us that the public will appreciate it after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6131)|
| 1:42:16| They get used to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| They become very accepting of roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| Cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| These are our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| The roundabouts, those are pretty close costs because we've got a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| We are able to work from a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| The signal with the turn lanes, that's we don't have a design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| So that's probably not as accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| I've tried to scale that, given the extra pavement that's going to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| And also, the traffic signal themselves will cost over $100,000 for each of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| So there is a difference in cost, and we believe the roundabout will be less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| And finally, the last slide, there was a question came up about why did North Shore Concord cost about the same as our two roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6168)|
| 1:42:56| Well, no roundabouts created the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| North Shore Concord is 130-foot diameter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| It's bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| We set it up for future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| It could be expanded to a two-lane roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| It was designed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Also, on the bottom right-hand side, there's what we call a bypass lane that was constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6187)|
| 1:43:13| The heavy right turn, they don't even have to go through the roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6193)|
| 1:43:16| There was additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| And when you compare the areas, one of our proposed roundabouts is about 7,000 square feet of new pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6198)|
| 1:43:27| So you'd multiply that by two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| That's close to 14,000 square feet of new pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| North Shore Concord, that one roundabout, was over 14,000 square feet of new pavement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| So it should have cost double what one of these does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| So anyway, with that, I am complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6223)|
| 1:43:44| Thank you, Mr. Childers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| We may have some questions here from the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| Any commissioners have questions for Mr. Childers or Representatives Cannon and Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| Now, I'd like to give the public who had signed up to speak on the issue an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6239)|
| 1:44:08| The first person on the list was Randall Carr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| Thank you, Mr. Carr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| And please give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6254)|
| 1:44:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| Yes, it's Randall Carr, 9737 Bob Gray Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6258)|
| 1:44:26| I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the commission this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| Actually, I've been a resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| My wife and I have lived at Bob Gray Road at this address for 16 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6271)|
| 1:44:35| Driveway right on to Bob Gray Road, just a quarter mile from the Bob Kirby intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Drive it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| I personally nor my wife, either one, have ever had an accident there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| We've had some close calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| But we certainly have had our share of calls to the Sheriff's Department for significant safety issues on Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| I've talked to people nearby who will tell me they love my house, but they hate they would never live on Bob Gray Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| simply for the speed and the traffic and the danger that's present on Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| I have personally sat back and watched this effort to see kind of what was going to happen over the last couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6304)|
| 1:45:12| I've not been involved in any way, shape, or form with any group in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6312)|
| 1:45:16| I've not spoken, nor do I know anybody that's been involved with the engineering aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| Nor, even though I know there will be people who will follow me that will significantly oppose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| I did my own research on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| And without question, the data is clear that Roundabout is the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6331)|
| 1:45:37| I'm not normally a fan of big government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| But I do believe that public safety is one of the most important things you guys can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6339)|
| 1:45:44| And it is just, I work in the healthcare industry in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| And if we're really about the well-being of people, issues like this need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| You know, the Japanese have a term when they manufacture something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| They have a term called pokyoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| It means mistake-proofing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| It means that every human is capable of making mistakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| You have to look at things from an engineering fix to keep mistakes from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| I can lament all day long other drivers and how poor they are or drunk they may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6368)|
| 1:46:14| or how fast they're going down Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| You know, and blame it on the driver or blame it on a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| This needs an engineering fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| And Roundabouts, if you study them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| and again, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, independent group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| has studied this for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6390)|
| 1:46:31| There's no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6391)|
| 1:46:32| I concur with the type of data that you've seen in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| Roundabouts are the best fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| And while I'm only speaking for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| I'm not the only person in that area that absolutely believes in the Roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| I know you'll hear some opposition, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| But, again, I think if we're driven by data and by the right public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| I think this is the only way to go to solve the problems of these intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| I thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Thank you, Mr. Carr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Next to speak is Norman Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6421)|
| 1:47:08| Yes, thank you, Norman Shaw, 1120 Winding Way Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| I live in the subdivision right off of Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6432)|
| 1:47:14| Been there about 23 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| Appreciate the chance to talk once again to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| I'm a retired title attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| Spent most of my all my career in Knoxville since 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| And I'm not particularly looking for confrontation or campaigns to lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6447)|
| 1:47:34| but I do feel like it's worth my time to come down here and talk to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| This is my third time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| And I think I can get it all in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| And I hope you'll indulge me maybe a minute more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| So I'm trying to get it all in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| Our position as the hour, the group, there's several hundred people that we're in contact with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6468)|
| 1:47:55| Unfortunately, not many are here today because we haven't had much time to gather and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6475)|
| 1:48:01| But the position, I think, for most people is that we're not against roundabouts per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| Roundabouts do serve a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| We're against roundabouts on Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| Those two intersections are only .7 miles apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| The roundabout did solve a bad problem there at Concord and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| I was familiar with that over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| So it does serve a service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| And there's a lot of people in the community against these roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| There was a meeting at the Cedar Bluff Library about a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| And Commissioner Wright said he was there along with Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| And you can see the vast majority were against the roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| They were very vocal about their opposition to the roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| So there's a lot of people in the community, voting people, that I don't think are going to be happy with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| My goal today is really ask for a postponement until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| Now, as I mentioned at the workshop last Monday, we were only notified, or I was notified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6536)|
| 1:49:02| and I told everybody else, I had only one week's notice to prepare for this meeting here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6542)|
| 1:49:08| There's a timeline you've been handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| And I was given that same timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| Just to go with it quickly, this was taken off the commission on June 25th by the request of Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6553)|
| 1:49:20| which we really appreciate, to give the citizens time to talk to Public Works and express our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| And we had the one meeting shortly following that on July the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6567)|
| 1:49:31| And we had, we were told, well, we expressed our concerns and our alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| We were told we'd meet again and that there would be no official action taken until we met again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| But three months passed to allow for another traffic count there at the intersections, which was done in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6582)|
| 1:49:50| And then finally, I got a notice actually three months later to the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6590)|
| 1:49:55| We met July the 12th the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| And I got a notice on October the 12th that let's go have the second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| And that's the good part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| The bad part is that we were told, well, it's already on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| So that was the shocking part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| And a little disconcerting to me that it was put back on the agenda without our having our second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| And I would have liked to have seen this presentation that you just saw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| which we thought we'd have that or something close to that at our second meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| But that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| So I feel like we're definitely at a disadvantage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| We finally did have that second meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| We got to squeeze it in between the workshop last Monday and the commission meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| We did have that meeting Thursday night at 6 o'clock, which we appreciate the time to allow people to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6633)|
| 1:50:39| Not much got accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| But we did ask for a lot of information, which was granted to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| And I would say Public Works did a good job getting that to us the next day by e-mail with about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6643)|
| 1:50:48| several attachments with a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Because we haven't had time to look at anything in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| We received that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6656)|
| 1:50:57| But, again, that was last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| That was disseminated to the people who had e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| And, of course, that was last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| And then there was a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| Now here we are at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| So we have not had any time to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| That's why you don't see many people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| Now, I know there's a motion on the floor to approve the roundabout right-of-way purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6670)|
| 1:51:15| But I guess I'm asking that maybe that be a motion be amended to postpone this to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| It's a commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| It's going to be sooner than usual because we have Thanksgiving next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6681)|
| 1:51:26| So it will be on the third Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| So give us a little bit of time to talk to the people, have some meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| and make a really decent presentation, except maybe three people here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6691)|
| 1:51:36| I would appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6696)|
| 1:51:37| I think, out of fairness, that's what ought to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| Because we've only had a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6700)|
| 1:51:42| We waited three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6702)|
| 1:51:43| And all of a sudden we get an advance notice of a week to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| gather all this information, and make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| So it's an uphill battle for the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| when they're trying to change anything that's put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| I would like to see almost a second opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6716)|
| 1:51:59| This has all been given to the consultant, Cannon & Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| And they are the only ones who looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| I don't know how that would be done exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| But, you know, any time you have a bad health problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| you get a second opinion from another doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| And we're going to spend a million dollars here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Seeing Mike's second opinion from another disinterested engineering firm would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| I see my time has run out, but I'm just about finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| So I guess I am asking that the motion be amended to postpone it until next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6745)|
| 1:52:30| You know, the three reasons I said that we feel that there's not a good reason to put roundabouts there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| The main one, the really big one, is it's not on flat land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| Every roundabout that I've looked at or been told about has been on flat land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| As I said before, this is Bob Gray follows the top of a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| It goes like this, up and down, up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| And the two intersections are at the bottom part of that up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6770)|
| 1:52:55| It's in a bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| Both are in a bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6776)|
| 1:52:57| And the side roads come in like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| I've never seen any or I'm not aware of anything that's been built, a roundabout built on a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6780)|
| 1:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| Mr. Shaw, I think that we probably had an adequate amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| If there's no questions from the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| Can I end on one last comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| I'd like to end on one last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6800)|
| 1:53:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| And there may be questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| There was a letter written to the Sentinel that came out Friday of an individual that lives at Graywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| He's a 92-year-old veteran, spent 40 years in the Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6811)|
| 1:53:37| This was sent out to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| You probably read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6820)|
| 1:53:41| And he's a world traveler, seen roundabouts all over the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6821)|
| 1:53:45| A very intelligent man, still very sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| And if you read his letter, he thinks that roundabouts are a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| One reason, because they're not on flat land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| His suggestion, as he ends his letter here, says, his recommendation to the commission is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6837)|
| 1:54:04| this is an unconscionable waste of public funds, and please cancel the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6844)|
| 1:54:09| Maybe we've got to listen to this wise man, world traveler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6849)|
| 1:54:13| Thank you, Mr. Shaw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| Hank LaForce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6855)|
| 1:54:20| Thank you, Mr. LaForce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Your name and address in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| Hank LaForce, 1137 Graywood Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6863)|
| 1:54:27| Again, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| I appreciate the opportunity to express my concern as well about building the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| specifically at the Bob Gray, Bob Kirby intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| I've owned the property on the southwest corner of that for 26 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| I think I'm qualified to have an opinion on that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| I know it quite well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| I don't dispute or deny that it's a dangerous little stretch road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| But I think that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| It's the stretch road that's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| It's not specifically the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| We looked at some topography information, and we kind of glossed over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| I think it's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| There's two issues going on with that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| One is you approach it quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| You're not blind, but if you're traveling west, you cross the little crest of a hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| and you're right on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| And if you're traveling east down Bob Gray, you're coming around a bend, down a corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| and again, you're right on the intersection before you know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| So it's where the intersection lies that's such an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| There's been two of the more serious accidents that are not in the data that didn't happen at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6914)|
| 1:55:19| I mean, one was the fatality this summer that happened several hundred yards away from the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| that we're not addressing at all with this roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| The other one was about, I guess, a year and a half ago or so was another serious injury accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| People traveling east on Bob Gray that just didn't negotiate the bend in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| went off the road, flipped the car, and the girl was pretty seriously injured that night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| had to be cut out, jaws of life, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| So I think we're looking specifically at the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| but we're not looking at the two-tenths of a mile in either direction prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| That's the first issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6948)|
| 1:55:50| The second one is just the overriding one simply is just speed in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| And the county did give us some new speed analysis they just recently did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6954)|
| 1:55:58| and found that 16% of the cars traveling in that area are speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| That's not a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| But it was traveling at 45 miles an hour or faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| which, traveling that fast, coming quickly onto this intersection down at the bottom of a hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| is just a bad combination, and it's a bad combination, I've got to believe, for a roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| What bothers me is that of all the proposals that we looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| or the things that they considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6982)|
| 1:56:24| just a simple traffic calming or an aggressive traffic calming plan was not even on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| So we're jumping to a roundabout conclusion without ever attempting anything first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| And that's kind of what bothers me in this whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| Basically, that's it. That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| We're jumping to a conclusion, I think, without considering one of the more cost-effective measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7002)|
| 1:56:50| If we don't address the speed, the roundabout just becomes a collection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| with a curb across the middle of the road at the bottom of this hill from either direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7013)|
| 1:56:57| And that's, I think, an even more potentially dangerous scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7017)|
| 1:57:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Thank you, Mr. LaForce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| Cheryl Ludeke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7029)|
| 1:57:10| Give your name and address, please, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| I'm Cheryl Ludeke at 9716 Cortez Drive, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7032)|
| 1:57:18| I've been a resident at that home for 25 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| First, I'd like to say that I am disappointed in the Knox County Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7042)|
| 1:57:27| meeting with Cannon & Cannon on 10-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7047)|
| 1:57:30| and then not getting back to the contact for the concerned citizens until 10-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| having a meeting again on 10-15, meeting with the citizens on 10-18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| and then here we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| I have respectfully waited for information this summer, traffic counts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| decisions to cut back brush, to move signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| and I don't feel at this point that the citizens were treated respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| with this kind of a last-minute effort to put this before you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| I don't support construction of the roundabout at Bob Gray and Bob Hickey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| because of the lack of sight distance, the hill, the bad curve at Ventry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7089)|
| 1:58:14| that the north and southbound roads of Bob Hickey coming up, it's not flat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7094)|
| 1:58:23| And I can't see anything with the topography that is going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| a roundabout at that location reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| You are proposing a modern solution for this traffic issue at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| in the middle of a severely antiquated road, Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| This road is not wide enough to carry the loads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| There are no shoulders, open ditches, poor lines of sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| You're not going to reduce the speed of the traffic as it approaches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7128)|
| 1:58:53| these roundabouts unless you, as well as the roundabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| put together a plan to improve the road as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| You are sticking modern improvement in the middle of a cow path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| At the very least, at this point, if you're going to go ahead with the roundabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7145)|
| 1:59:12| at least start the upgrade for the remainder of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| and make the road in its entirety safe for the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| because it is not a safe road. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| Thank you, Ms. Ludeke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| Okay, commissioners, do we have any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7167)|
| 1:59:31| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| I guess I have a question either for any of the citizens that have spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| and that is, have you seen this presentation from Cannon & Cannon that we saw today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7177)|
| 1:59:44| No, I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| You have not seen it at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7185)|
| 1:59:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| Let me make just a quick remark here, and then I'll have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| My remark is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| When I represented the Fifth District, I remember well the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| over the roundabout at North Shore and Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| And it was contentious, and everyone had an opportunity to have their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7204)|
| 2:00:09| There were a number of public meetings, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| When all was said and done, I voted for the roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| because I felt that was the best scenario there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| I still feel that way, and after the roundabout was completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| I think maybe I got one complaint from people who said that they didn't like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| because once it was completed and once people got used to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| they thought, wow, this is a pretty neat thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| My comment is that the people there had the opportunity to come in and weigh in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| Now, the fact that we have seen this proposal today and they haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| I guess is a little bit of concern to me because my feeling is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| if the roundabout is a good idea, and I'm not saying I'm against the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| if the roundabout's a good idea today, it'll be a good idea November 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7251)|
| 2:00:55| when we have our work session, and it'll be a good idea on November 19th when we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| And so I'm in favor of giving these folks the opportunity to have a little bit more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| because they said they met on Thursday, they got information on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7265)|
| 2:01:08| that's 48 hours, and here we are ready to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7268)|
| 2:01:12| Now, when I lived in the Cedar Bluff area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| I probably drove that road maybe three or four times a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| Now that I live across the river, I may drive on that road once a year, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7278)|
| 2:01:24| Because it's just the nature of where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7284)|
| 2:01:28| And so since I don't, am not going to be driving on the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7288)|
| 2:01:32| I'd like for the people who do drive on that road to have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| to feel like that they've had an opportunity to get the information that they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| to ask the questions that they need, whether they agree or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| and whether they agree or not with our vote, I think it's important that they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7302)|
| 2:01:46| that they have had the opportunity to review this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| I think it's a good report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| I think they've put a lot of time into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| But I guess my concern is that if they haven't seen it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7313)|
| 2:01:56| and they had a meeting on Thursday, and here we are 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| and we're going to be voting on something that's going to impact their lives every single day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7319)|
| 2:02:03| I would like for them to have the opportunity to have an extra three weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7323)|
| 2:02:07| to ask additional questions and then come back before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| because, again, I believe if it's a good idea now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| it'll be a good idea on the 12th, it'll be a good idea on the 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7333)|
| 2:02:16| and we'll have an opportunity to at least have them feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| that they have had adequate opportunity to get their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7339)|
| 2:02:22| So I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer this to our November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| We have a substitute motion to hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| Now the discussion is directed to the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| I wanted to speak to what Commissioner Hammond was speaking about a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| You know, this came before us several months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7368)|
| 2:02:53| and the community asked for a second opinion or a relook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7373)|
| 2:02:58| and we've actually went through the process again, and the numbers are worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| And while we were waiting, another fatal accident happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| Now I'm not saying that this construction would have stopped that fatal accident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| but the longer that we sit on our hands and baffle or decide or whatever we do about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7392)|
| 2:03:20| whether it's a roundabout, a stop sign, speed humps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| six licensed engineers that would not give up their license for an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7403)|
| 2:03:29| have said this is the best way to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| We've asked to look at the numbers again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| They looked at the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| The numbers were worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7415)|
| 2:03:37| And so I don't know why we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| I mean, we're going to make somebody mad with nearly every vote we have at every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7421)|
| 2:03:45| I mean, somebody loses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| And so somebody's opinion is different than the commission's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| But the longer we do it, we're not changing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| You know, we're going to come back a month from now, and it's going to be roundabouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| are the suggestion of six engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7439)|
| 2:04:04| And I just think it's a mistake to continue to wait after we've already went over it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7448)|
| 2:04:09| McKenzie, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7449)|
| 2:04:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| You know, I'm a fan of roundabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| They do alleviate, you know, kind of tertiary routes, high volumes of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7459)|
| 2:04:26| I think they do a good job of keeping cars moving once people get used to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| And you're right, Commissioner, people are very apprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| when they hear a roundabout's coming to town, you know, coming to my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| But they generally work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7478)|
| 2:04:43| With that said, I'm more about the process in terms of the community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7483)|
| 2:04:52| You just can't beat giving people information and having that dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7492)|
| 2:04:59| And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| I don't know if sufficient dialogue's taken place as far as the end results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7500)|
| 2:05:06| and the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7506)|
| 2:05:08| Question, and this is probably to Cannon and Cannon or someone from the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7508)|
| 2:05:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| There was a lot of dialogue about the topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7515)|
| 2:05:18| And I see here you said that the topography is such that each one's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7518)|
| 2:05:24| in between two hill crests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7524)|
| 2:05:28| Does that mean all we're going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| Because I do agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| Other than if I looked at UT Hospital, I think they have one coming off of a hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| That's about the only one I've seen that comes off of a hill in my dealing with roundabouts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7536)|
| 2:05:43| you know, D.C., Knoxville, wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| So could you address that concern real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7545)|
| 2:05:51| Well, the very first two roundabouts that we designed were off Middlebrook Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7551)|
| 2:05:56| in Madison-Matlock, a mid-park industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| We did those for the city of Knoxville several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7559)|
| 2:06:02| One of those, two of the three approaches, a three-legged roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| has a steep approach coming into it, very similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| In fact, one leg is quite a bit steeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7570)|
| 2:06:12| I don't know the exact numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| Never heard any problems with that roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7574)|
| 2:06:20| There's at least two research reports that I read that said it's preferable to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| a roundabout at the bottom of a hill crest like this, the bottom of a sag curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| as opposed to being on the top, that that's preferable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| as long as you have the appropriate sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| And as I noted, the real issue is the sight distance to the roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| as well as as you're approaching, looking at the cars from the other approaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| And there's clear standards on how that's to be designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7604)|
| 2:06:47| And we have, you know, we've evaluated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7607)|
| 2:06:49| And both of these roundabouts meet those standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7614)|
| 2:06:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7615)|
| 2:06:57| Mr. Vanderveet, in part of the handouts that we got regarding this was a timetable of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7617)|
| 2:07:07| that would be needed and so forth even before construction could be started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| And it was something like four months, am I correct, in that neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7632)|
| 2:07:18| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| I think it's longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7639)|
| 2:07:20| It's about 240 days, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7640)|
| 2:07:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| My point is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| That particular area there, as you had pointed out earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| has three schools very close, which anytime you have road construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7650)|
| 2:07:39| the actual construction doesn't just poof happen overnight either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| It's going to take some time to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7663)|
| 2:07:45| And the time to do that on any road, and particularly on a busy road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| is when there is less traffic and less chance for additional accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| Now, if this is pushed forward a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7676)|
| 2:08:01| will that still fit into the timetable of being able to do this next summer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7681)|
| 2:08:08| We consider it dangerously close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| If you push it to December, we won't build these until 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| I can't guarantee you if you push it to November that we'll build them in the summer of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7694)|
| 2:08:20| But I also think it would be intellectually dishonest to tell you that we absolutely could not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7700)|
| 2:08:26| Obviously, the more time you give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| the more opportunity we're going to have to see these through to construction and completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7708)|
| 2:08:32| We had hoped to build them this summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7712)|
| 2:08:34| and obviously the process piece has taken far longer than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7714)|
| 2:08:39| Well, I wanted to get that point out for this fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7719)|
| 2:08:44| Another year meant how many accidents did we see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| and how many injuries did we see on those charts earlier in a one-year time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7727)|
| 2:08:55| If we don't get on this now, there is a very distinct possibility this will not happen until 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7735)|
| 2:09:01| which means there's another umpteen accidents and umpteen injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7741)|
| 2:09:07| We have had no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| Let me go back and say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| I've been a proponent for the last 40 years of community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| I'm sorry that this latest information didn't get to the folks there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7756)|
| 2:09:24| before they had a chance to look at it to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7764)|
| 2:09:27| But when you see this, the figures are so compelling that there has to be something done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7767)|
| 2:09:35| And they're also compelling to the point that this is the answer, the best answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| If we don't do something as soon as we can in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7781)|
| 2:09:45| then we're putting the county at liable, too, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7785)|
| 2:09:51| You know, I think that it would be good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| and I'm sure that your office would be more than happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| even though it's after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| that maybe if the citizens in this 200 or whatever group that Mr. Shaw is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| got a chance to see this presentation that we just saw a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7804)|
| 2:10:08| maybe that would relieve some of the fears and tensions that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| even though that we may have, quote, unquote, today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7813)|
| 2:10:16| go ahead and officially approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7816)|
| 2:10:18| But if we don't get on this now, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| you just heard that there will be a very good chance it will not happen until 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7822)|
| 2:10:28| and how many more people are going to have accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| or get killed there at one of those two intersections because we put it off for a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7831)|
| 2:10:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| Mr. Van Vade, I had a couple of questions also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| The essence of the presentation by Cannon & Cannon is these are really good solutions to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7841)|
| 2:10:49| in terms of safety and expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| Now, the opponents to the roundabouts have spoken about the fact that they've just not been exposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7852)|
| 2:11:01| to the specifics of this report in a timely way or enough time to address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| Would it be reasonable to say that maybe that's true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7867)|
| 2:11:14| but also they should have in their investigation of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7874)|
| 2:11:19| they should know that roundabouts are, in general, an advisable safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7879)|
| 2:11:30| Is that probably accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| I mean, that's fairly commonly known now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7893)|
| 2:11:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7896)|
| 2:11:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| They can address the expense issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| The only other question that I heard in there that I was curious about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| was Mr. LaForce's issue on traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| Now, was traffic calming, you know, was that an aspect of the study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7910)|
| 2:11:57| And maybe Mr. Childress could address that or somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7917)|
| 2:12:01| but I don't know whether that was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| I didn't catch it, if it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| It might actually be a good issue for Mr. Sexton to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| He's our traffic engineer who handles our traffic calming program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| and he will tell you that it is typically limited to interior roads to subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| where you do not have the sorts of issues with emergency apparatus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| and that kind of thing that you would on Bob Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| But John does this every day and does it very well for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| so I'd like for him to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| And then, Mr. Chairman, before the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7950)|
| 2:12:32| if I could speak to process just a little bit to Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| and Commissioner Hammond's concerns about the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7955)|
| 2:12:37| because we're very sensitive to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7960)|
| 2:12:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7961)|
| 2:12:42| Mr. Sexton, give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| John Sexton, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| And, in fact, roundabouts are a traffic calming device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7967)|
| 2:12:52| A management tool to control intersection traffic movements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7972)|
| 2:12:59| We do have a traffic calming program been in place in the county since 2000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7979)|
| 2:13:04| We really limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| It generally consists of speed humps placed on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| We limit those to subdivisions, occasionally a dead-end street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| that's not inside a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| The primary reason is the comfortable crossing speed of a speed hump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=7995)|
| 2:13:20| is 10 to 15 miles per hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8000)|
| 2:13:22| And one can well imagine the difficulty of an ambulance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8002)|
| 2:13:26| And Bob Gray Road is a collector roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| All the intersecting roadways that we're dealing with here are collector-type roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8009)|
| 2:13:33| Higher connectivity to outside roads, more likely to be carrying emergency vehicle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8013)|
| 2:13:41| And so the speed humps are just not a tool we would use on that type of roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8021)|
| 2:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8026)|
| 2:13:47| Thank you, Mr. Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| Dwight, do you want to finish up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8029)|
| 2:13:51| And then I'll finish up with a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8033)|
| 2:13:54| I just wanted to speak to the process question just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8034)|
| 2:13:58| Because obviously no process is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8038)|
| 2:14:00| And, Commissioner, by no means would I sit and represent to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| that this one is any exception to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8043)|
| 2:14:06| I would want you to understand, though, that the bulk of the content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| that you saw in the Canon in Canon presentation today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8050)|
| 2:14:15| was in the handout that was distributed to the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8055)|
| 2:14:21| who have an interest in this issue this past Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| And Canon in Canon did, Ms. Bottoms did attempt to make the presentation similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8064)|
| 2:14:29| to what you saw on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8069)|
| 2:14:31| But it was, as these things sometimes are, a fairly contentious discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8071)|
| 2:14:36| And we simply weren't able to get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8076)|
| 2:14:38| We ended up having what I hope was a productive meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| But we really couldn't get through the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| Our emotions were running high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| And we simply were not able to get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8086)|
| 2:14:49| I would also point out that some of the core concepts that you've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8089)|
| 2:14:54| about why roundabouts work better in these kinds of applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8094)|
| 2:14:59| were covered pretty extensively at the two public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| at Cedar Bluff Branch Library in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8103)|
| 2:15:08| So the core concepts that we've had on the table here are not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8108)|
| 2:15:13| We've updated the data upon request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8113)|
| 2:15:15| But we've never wavered in our belief that for these particular intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8115)|
| 2:15:22| this is the best application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8122)|
| 2:15:26| And if I could say anything to this body and to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8126)|
| 2:15:30| Mr. Carr, Mr. Shaw, Mr. LaForce, to the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8130)|
| 2:15:34| just ask you to remember we have no agenda here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8134)|
| 2:15:37| other than to bring you the safest roads that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8137)|
| 2:15:41| We're always looking and open to whatever the most appropriate solution might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8141)|
| 2:15:46| By no means are we zealots for roundabouts or intersections or signalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8146)|
| 2:15:51| What we look for is that solution that will bring you the safest road that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| And it's been our belief and continues to be our belief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| that for this particular stretch of road, these are the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8158)|
| 2:16:02| Okay. Mr. Smith. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| I want to get addressed to the constituents that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8164)|
| 2:16:08| the people in the neighborhoods that live on those roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| You know, we've heard from the engineers, the six engineers that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8171)|
| 2:16:17| Then, Commissioner Hammond, I agree with you that, yes, we need to let the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8177)|
| 2:16:21| we want to hear from the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| We do want to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| That's very important to me and give them the chance to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8184)|
| 2:16:27| But also, taking what Commissioner Brown and Commissioner Andrews were saying, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8187)|
| 2:16:33| you know, folks, we have heard from our engineers and cannon and cannon people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8193)|
| 2:16:40| We had a very, very in-depth lunch meeting on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8200)|
| 2:16:44| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8204)|
| 2:16:45| And each of us, any of us, had any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8205)|
| 2:16:48| And we are your elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8208)|
| 2:16:50| You elect us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8210)|
| 2:16:51| You elect us to make those decisions for you, the tougher or easy ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8211)|
| 2:16:57| And this is one of those situations that I'm going to go with Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| and those and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| It's not going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| It's just going to hold us up more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| And there might be more accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8225)|
| 2:17:06| I'm very well pleased with what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8226)|
| 2:17:09| I'm not an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8229)|
| 2:17:11| But I have thorough trust in cannon and cannon and what you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| Dwight, you and your office and your people have all the confidence in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| And I'm ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8240)|
| 2:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8244)|

| 2:20:45| So, out of respect, I'd like to move it on for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| I'm seconding Brad's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8447)|
| 2:20:48| If that's okay with Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8448)|
| 2:20:49| We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8449)|
| 2:20:50| No, it's going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8450)|
| 2:20:51| Nobody's going to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8451)|
| 2:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8452)|
| 2:20:53| But you're going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| I'm going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8454)|
| 2:20:55| I'm going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| I'm going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| I'm going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| I'm going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| I'm going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8459)|
| 2:21:01| But you would second the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| No, I'm seconding the motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8466)|
| 2:21:07| Allow Amy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8467)|
| 2:21:08| Oh, to the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8470)|
| 2:21:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8471)|
| 2:21:12| So, we have a motion to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8472)|
| 2:21:16| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8478)|
| 2:21:19| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| We had a discussion Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8481)|
| 2:21:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8483)|
| 2:21:24| Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8484)|
| 2:21:25| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| We had a discussion Friday in our meeting with PBA, myself, and Jim York, the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8489)|
| 2:21:36| director for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| And I'm not for sure that city council is going to take up this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8499)|
| 2:21:49| But what we have concluded is that both Mayor Burchett and Mayor Rojero are willing to freeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8509)|
| 2:21:59| this parking rate where it is currently until July 1, until our salary survey is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8519)|
| 2:22:10| And then we can take up the issue again at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| So, how you want to handle that is completely up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| I think both mayors are willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| And what is the, I guess, the rule of thumb as far as PBA is concerned is that if both mayors agree to something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8544)|
| 2:22:35| then that can happen if there is differing of opinions and the status quo stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| But both are willing to do the freeze until July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8560)|
| 2:22:46| And Dale Smith is here from PBA as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| If you want to ask him anything, that's perfectly fine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| But that's what I wanted to say to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8578)|
| 2:22:59| Mr. Smith, your name came up several times, not in a negative way or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8579)|
| 2:23:04| but we appreciate your input on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8590)|
| 2:23:11| I apologize for not making the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8591)|
| 2:23:13| I had a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8593)|
| 2:23:14| Name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| Dale Smith, 400 Main Street, room M-22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8596)|
| 2:23:24| One of the questions, Dale, was that it was your desire not to reconvene the parking committee for some reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8604)|
| 2:23:36| And that was a curiosity to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8616)|
| 2:23:38| I know structurally there's some problems possibly with the committee's reformation or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8618)|
| 2:23:44| but I think it was they were given the task of meeting annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8624)|
| 2:23:50| There was some discussion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8630)|
| 2:23:52| Anyway, anything that you can give us would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8632)|
| 2:23:56| Well, actually, I never spoke to anybody prior to your workshop about convening a committee again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8636)|
| 2:24:03| So I don't know how they got the sense I was against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8643)|
| 2:24:08| I mean, from a personal practical standpoint, it's kind of like, do you want to have another root canal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| So it's not something I think I would enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| But the essence of it, in fact, to be perfectly honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8657)|
| 2:24:22| Chris Caldwell and I both sat on that committee, as did Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| and I had forgotten that the last recommendation was to revisit things on an annual basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8667)|
| 2:24:34| And I think Chris and I have agreed, what were we thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| Because we haven't even fully implemented the recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8679)|
| 2:24:43| specifically the rate increase that Chris just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| The essence of my position is what Chris said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8688)|
| 2:24:54| If both mayors want to pursue anything in terms of this building's operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8694)|
| 2:25:01| then we'll happily oblige.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| If one mayor wants to and the other mayor doesn't, then we'd happily sit still, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| We just sort of leave whatever the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8710)|
| 2:25:13| In this case, since your workshop, Chris and I have, I think, both come to believe and understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8713)|
| 2:25:21| that the city's not very interested in reconvening the parking committee component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8721)|
| 2:25:29| But they are willing to do what Chris said a few minutes ago in regard to freezing the rate until July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8729)|
| 2:25:37| and then they would revisit that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8737)|
| 2:25:40| And I have no skin in that game because what you collect from your employees for parking in this garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| or in the Kessel Garage, you retain, as does the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8746)|
| 2:25:51| So it doesn't impact budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| It doesn't really impact PBA in any way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8757)|
| 2:25:58| Thank you, Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8758)|
| 2:25:59| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| There may be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8760)|
| 2:26:01| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| No, I don't have anything for Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| I really think that this makes this motion even more valid that we defer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8765)|
| 2:26:10| So hopefully within 30 days we could potentially withdraw it once we get confirmation that both mayors don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8770)|
| 2:26:15| This could potentially go away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8775)|
| 2:26:17| or the crafters could amend it to deal with some of the other aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8777)|
| 2:26:23| Again, I'm just speaking in favor of the approval of the substitute motion or the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8783)|
| 2:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8789)|
| 2:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8790)|
| 2:26:31| And Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| Dale, just real quick, if you'll come back to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8792)|
| 2:26:35| Has anything changed in your opinion as to opening up the garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| something that we can be thinking about if we're going to look at it next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| I mean, because I was pretty intense with the meeting with you a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8802)|
| 2:26:48| And if you'll just share with the committee here your just thoughts on reopening it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| and what you think about the fees and how they compare to everywhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| if you think we need to make any increases there or do what we said we were going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8817)|
| 2:27:01| and follow through with it or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8821)|
| 2:27:04| Well, if I could start in reverse order and talk about the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8824)|
| 2:27:08| I think it's worth mentioning that the increase in the fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8828)|
| 2:27:14| was not being driven by a revenue grab by the city or the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8834)|
| 2:27:20| and since we don't get any of it, certainly not by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8840)|
| 2:27:23| It was a philosophical belief that when you look in this part of the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8843)|
| 2:27:30| and you look at what the market for parking is at Riverview Tower, First Tennessee, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8850)|
| 2:27:38| that it was clear that the public was subsidizing, if you will, employee parking here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8858)|
| 2:27:46| to a very great degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8866)|
| 2:27:49| The rates had not been changed for at least 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8869)|
| 2:27:55| and that we had sort of lagged keeping up with the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8875)|
| 2:27:59| and that that was not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8879)|
| 2:28:02| Now, this is the first job I've ever had where I had to pay anything for my parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8882)|
| 2:28:07| so there's that philosophy too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| You can argue those all you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| but the consensus of that committee was that the rate should begin to walk up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| and we used as a target basically that this garage would cost our employees per month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8897)|
| 2:28:24| roughly half the market rate, meaning First Tennessee Riverview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| So that's a short answer on the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8909)|
| 2:28:32| And I'll be glad to talk to any of you on the phone or in person to go into greater detail on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8912)|
| 2:28:39| In regard to the opening it to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| the only comment I guess I saw out of your workshop was, I believe, Commissioner Hammons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8921)|
| 2:28:46| and it addressed, well, we open it for Boomsday and the football games,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| and that seems like we're sending a mixed signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| There's some very, very big practical differences in opening it for football games and Boomsday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8935)|
| 2:29:01| and doing it during the workday, and that is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8941)|
| 2:29:06| The people that come into this garage on Boomsday and football game days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8946)|
| 2:29:11| the vehicles that are non-employees without ID cards, the vehicles are screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8951)|
| 2:29:17| Their trunks are usually looked into and mirrors look under the cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8957)|
| 2:29:21| and they're just looking for explosives, no personal searches or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267121022?start=8961)|
