| 2:43:00| There may have been a reason I got out because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| You don't know and I'm not privileged to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9783)|
| 2:43:06| I'm doing my best to communicate to you what this case was about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9786)|
| 2:43:11| Now, your issues as it relates to effectiveness and good cause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| it is an excuse for failing to perform a required act by law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| That's what good cause is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9802)|
| 2:43:24| You have to determine based upon the totality of the circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9804)|
| 2:43:28| if good cause exists and what's being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| That's what I'm advising you now and that's all I'm advising you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| So you have to weigh the facts to determine whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| there is a legal excuse for failing to perform a required act by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9820)|
| 2:43:48| and that is up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| That's a policy thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9830)|
| 2:43:52| It's not a law director thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9832)|
| 2:43:54| So when it relates to me settling a case, it does not condemn anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9834)|
| 2:44:01| It doesn't prove anything against anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| and you can't infer that to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| And I've tried to make it clear to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9848)|
| 2:44:10| and I'm trying to make it clear to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| I made that decision and I made that decision based upon two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| Economics for the taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| and the best benefit to that child, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| The facts were in my favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| The law was in my favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| But should you go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| sometimes you shouldn't just go forward to be going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| It's not the right thing to do and by George I decided not to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| and that's why I decided not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| I can't make it any more clear than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| The law was in my favor and I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| The facts were in my favor and I believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| But sometimes it's not in the best interest of all concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| to go ahead and fight the fight just for principle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9893)|
| 2:44:57| So that's the decision that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9897)|
| 2:45:00| Now you all are talking about something different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9900)|
| 2:45:03| but what my issue, even talking about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| is that it was referred to this case as a foundation, whereas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9907)|
| 2:45:16| and it shouldn't be in the whereas's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9916)|
| 2:45:21| That's where we find ourselves and you all have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9921)|
| 2:45:24| you all need to deal with this as the facts before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9924)|
| 2:45:27| and make a decision whether there's good cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| to remove somebody from the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| If there is, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9931)|
| 2:45:32| If there's not, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9932)|
| 2:45:34| But don't use this case to do it with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9934)|
| 2:45:36| because it does not meet the standard of good cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9936)|
| 2:45:38| That's all I'm trying to tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| I'm giving you that legal advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| Okay, thank you, Mr. Lauda, Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9943)|
| 2:45:45| And I also want to be clear from my previous comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9945)|
| 2:45:48| that that was a general statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9948)|
| 2:45:49| I know Commissioner Jay did not have any allegations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9949)|
| 2:45:51| about the kid in his statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9951)|
| 2:45:53| I just did not want us to go down that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9953)|
| 2:45:58| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9958)|
| 2:46:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9960)|
| 2:46:02| I'm not going to speak to the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| but I just wanted to remind commissioners that every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9964)|
| 2:46:09| we move items with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9969)|
| 2:46:11| to the formal commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| And it gives us all the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9973)|
| 2:46:15| for an additional seven days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| to digest the information that's presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9977)|
| 2:46:21| And because we couldn't talk about this amongst ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| prior to tonight, I think this is very important information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9985)|
| 2:46:29| that we do need to review with ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| or ask the law director on an independent basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9992)|
| 2:46:35| if you have additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9995)|
| 2:46:37| So I'm going to support the motion for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=9997)|
| 2:46:42| And I move the previous question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| Okay, Commissioner Skinmaker has moved the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| Parliamentary procedures, that ends debate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| And that will call for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10012)|
| 2:46:55| The motion that is before us is to send forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10015)|
| 2:47:00| to next week's meeting with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10020)|
| 2:47:05| Okay, this will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10025)|
| 2:47:09| Madam Clerk and for those in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| the clerk's office leads all of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| All right, she'll begin with the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10035)|
| 2:47:17| Go ahead and say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10037)|
| 2:47:19| I'll begin in the second commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10042)|
| 2:47:24| So to vote, let me just clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| to vote aye means we're moving it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| without recommendation to our regular commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| on Monday, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10053)|
| 2:47:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10054)|
| 2:47:35| Okay, I will vote aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10055)|

| 2:48:20| All right, what I'd like to do is I'm hearing some...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| Yeah, I'd like to entertain a motion to have a recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10102)|
| 2:48:43| Before we do that, is there a lot of debate on the animal or can we make a motion to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| it for without recommendation, because they're still here, and I think they'd like to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10128)|
| 2:48:55| So can we go ahead and do that if there's no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10135)|
| 2:48:59| Kitty, could you go ahead? That was item 43, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10139)|
| 2:49:03| Item 43 is consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10143)|
| 2:49:08| amended in Knox County Code, Chapter 6, Article 2, entitled Animal Control to authorize a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10148)|

| 2:49:47| Okay, there's a proper motion by Commissioner Anders and a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10187)|

| 2:49:57| Before you announce the vote, will you make sure there's nobody in the audience that was against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| it, because I don't know if there was or not. Okay, I have not announced it. Is there anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10200)|
| 2:50:05| here who's against the TNR ordinance who may want to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10205)|
| 2:50:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10211)|
| 2:50:12| Okay, I can see it. Okay, all right, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10212)|

| 2:50:23| All right, a motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10223)|
| 2:50:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10226)|

| 2:50:39| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10239)|
| 2:50:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10242)|
| 2:50:49| Good evening, and welcome back to the second half of tonight's County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10249)|
| 2:50:57| I'd like to, as we reconvene, I'm going to ask the Clerk's Office to go ahead and call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10257)|

| 2:51:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10286)|
| 2:51:26| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10286)|
| 2:51:27| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10287)|
| 2:51:29| All right, thank you. Madam Clerk, if you would not mind calling the first item on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10289)|
| 2:51:36| On page 7, item number 40, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10296)|
| 2:51:42| Tennessee, requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission to recommend amendments to the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10302)|
| 2:51:47| County Zoning Ordinance to require all text amendments to the zoning ordinance to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10307)|
| 2:51:53| initiated by resolution of the Knox County Commission, resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| Okay, thank you. Is there a motion on this item? I know, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10320)|
| 2:52:05| you may want to introduce this item to Commission before we entertain a motion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10325)|
| 2:52:09| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10329)|
| 2:52:10| I think that might be appropriate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10330)|
| 2:52:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10332)|
| 2:52:13| All right, so yeah, that's all right. So could we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10336)|
| 2:52:17| Thank you. That's what I was looking for. So we have a proper motion from Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10337)|
| 2:52:21| and a second from Commissioner Bessler to send forward no recommendation. All right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10341)|
| 2:52:25| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| All right, this came as a way to kind of clarify the way that we do zoning ordinances for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10346)|
| 2:52:38| County. We have two different kinds of procedures. One is for a map ordinance and one is for a text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10358)|
| 2:52:44| ordinance. And the problem is we didn't really have any clear language of how to deal with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10364)|
| 2:52:50| text ordinance. So in the past, what could happen is, say, Commissioner Biggs could go to the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10370)|
| 2:53:00| and say, I'd like to amend the zoning ordinance regarding travel trailers and, you know, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10380)|
| 2:53:09| a residential zone. And then the MPC would then put it, do their homework, put it on their agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10389)|
| 2:53:16| and approve it and send it over for us to do final approval. But in the past, they've actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10396)|
| 2:53:23| had just private citizens go to MPC and ask that the Knox County zoning ordinance be amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10403)|
| 2:53:31| and give them what they wanted to do. And then MPC would then turn around and go, okay, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10411)|
| 2:53:37| fine, we'll do that. They'll have their staff prepare a report, they'll put it on their MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| agenda, and then they'll send it over to us. So what we really wanted to do was try to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10423)|
| 2:53:49| if you want to amend the Knox County zoning ordinance, it's got to go through the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10429)|
| 2:53:55| body first. And we have MPC here every month. All they need to do is say, we have been requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10435)|
| 2:54:03| that it's time to update, you know, XYZ ordinance regarding to zoning only, and here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10443)|
| 2:54:12| the reason why, and we would like to ask the Knox County Commission to move forward with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10452)|
| 2:54:17| where at that point then we would put it on as a resolution, vote on it and send it over to MPC for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10457)|
| 2:54:24| them to go ahead and start all the due diligence on it. So it was just, this is just a way to kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10464)|
| 2:54:30| of give them a path to work by where we've never really stipulated it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10470)|
| 2:54:36| Okay, we have two lights on, I'm seeing Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Jay's light on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10476)|
| 2:54:45| Frankly, I was pulling up my computer and didn't see which one came on first, but go ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| Commissioner Jay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Do we have anybody from MPC? I see Jeff. Do you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| an opinion or a thought on this? Or can you help us maybe understand the process a bit? If you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10496)|
| 2:55:03| name and address for reference. I'm Jeff Welch with Knoxville-Knox County Planning, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10503)|
| 2:55:11| Mr. Green is out of town today. We're not sure what kind of problem there has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10511)|
| 2:55:18| a problem that we're trying to fix. So like I said, the Commission is trying to fix, you know, we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10518)|
| 2:55:24| had any major issues that we've seen that have created a problem in the past, the way the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10524)|
| 2:55:30| operating system is right now. But they're, you know, the Commission and the Planning staff deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10530)|
| 2:55:36| with a lot of agenda items that don't come before you. And we get a lot of, you know, we see problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10536)|
| 2:55:42| or issues that through the development process that we want to vet with the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10542)|
| 2:55:48| first to see whether it is appropriate to bring to this body. Then we bring it to your body and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10548)|
| 2:55:53| have that final say whether it is yea or nay on any planning amendments or text amendments or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10553)|
| 2:56:00| map amendments. So I think the process has been working very well. Potentially what could occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10560)|
| 2:56:08| here is, you know, if there's an issue we want to try to resolve and address, it could be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10568)|
| 2:56:15| the process could take another 60 or 90 days if it has to come to you based on that having come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10575)|
| 2:56:20| back to the Planning Commission. Depending on when you first direct us to do that, then when we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10580)|
| 2:56:26| take it on at the Planning Commission, it could be another 60 or 90 days before it would then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10586)|
| 2:56:31| to come back to you or longer. So that's sort of our position. We're not quite sure what the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| has been. So, you know, it's obviously your zoning ordinance, it's what you want to direct us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10597)|
| 2:56:44| but again, we're not sure what problem it's trying to fix. So currently right now, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10604)|
| 2:56:51| Joe Builder says, I don't like this and I think it ought to be amended to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| It, you know, is something that we as staff would say, well, look at it and say, no, this is, we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| this is a good idea or a bad idea. We'll, you know, take it to the Commission. And then the 14-member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10619)|
| 2:57:05| Commission would then take it up and debate it. Yeah, and if they, yea or nay, because, you know, they work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| with it a lot more, you know, in detail and address a lot of issues that this Commission does not see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10629)|
| 2:57:16| And then if it were to come out of there as a recommendation, then it would come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| Yes. Okay. So, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10640)|
| 2:57:30| I mean, perhaps you could address the, what are we fixing? Okay. Maybe there's an example or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10650)|
| 2:57:36| something that you can help us. Yeah, in section 6.3, 0.02, we're adding in the word map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10656)|
| 2:57:45| And it says, map amendments shall be initiated by filing an application with the Metropolitan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| Planning Commission on forms available in the Metropolitan Planning Office. Text amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10670)|
| 2:57:57| shall be initiated by resolution of the County Commission. And again, it's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10677)|
| 2:58:06| citizens who may or may not even be from Knox County can go to the planning agency and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10686)|
| 2:58:12| hey, I want a resolution, I want to amend the zoning ordinance of Knox County to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10692)|
| 2:58:20| Because we're the legislators of Knox County, it should come from us first to tell the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10700)|
| 2:58:27| Metropolitan Planning Commission this is something that we agree with you and we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10707)|
| 2:58:32| That's all. And if you read the body of the resolution, you'll see what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10712)|
| 2:58:38| Can I continue on my time? I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. Yes, go ahead. I'm worried that that would make us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10718)|
| 2:58:47| would force us to be sort of the subject matter experts on zoning and other related things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10727)|
| 2:58:52| approve it before it goes to them. Because isn't that why we have a planning commission with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| sort of subject matter experts? No, we're talking about initiating it. That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10736)|
| 2:59:05| Okay, I think I'm still confused, but I'll yield my time. But also, Commissioner, what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10745)|
| 2:59:09| going to do is they're going to bring it to us and say, look, we see a problem with this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10749)|
| 2:59:17| Here's a way that we think we can improve on this ordinance. Then all we do is say, fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10757)|
| 2:59:23| put it on as a resolution authorizing the Metropolitan Planning Commission to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10763)|
| 2:59:29| and move forward and adjust that ordinance. We don't, it's not like we're getting, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10769)|
| 2:59:36| working seven or ten or twelve Knox County zoning ordinances a month. I mean, at most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10776)|
| 2:59:42| they're getting probably one every two months. So this is not some major deal. And if their staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10782)|
| 2:59:49| realizes there's a problem in the ordinance, bring it to us, say, hey, here's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10789)|
| 2:59:54| This needs to be addressed. All we do is say, sure, go ahead and address it and bring it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10794)|
| 2:59:59| to us for final approval. But I think as the legislators, we need to say, this is our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10799)|
| 3:00:07| ordinance that we're responsible for that we need to initiate it. And that's all I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| Thank you. All right. Thank you. Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10812)|
| 3:00:20| To me, this seems like we're doing two things. We're taking citizens out of this and their right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10820)|
| 3:00:27| to try to better government. And two, we're adding a step to the process. We are the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10827)|
| 3:00:34| We do get the final say. Anything that comes before us, we can vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10834)|
| 3:00:39| It just kind of looks like a solution looking for a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10839)|
| 3:00:47| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10847)|
| 3:00:50| Oh, sorry. There it's on. Thank you, Mr. Chair. So in essence, let me ask you this. We had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10850)|
| 3:00:58| instance come before us, and it took a little while to get it to straighten out, where we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10858)|
| 3:01:02| those enclosed, acclimatized storage units, multi-story. And the zoning ordinance we had at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10862)|
| 3:01:09| that point in time, you had to have certain acreage with all the difference. So they denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10869)|
| 3:01:15| the zoning where they went before the zoning because it didn't fit within the current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10875)|
| 3:01:21| And then it finally started working around where we sent information back when it finally got to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| We had to send it back and take care of it. Well, let's take one of those steps out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10887)|
| 3:01:32| It's a use that we can use, that we can get it out quicker so that individual can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10892)|
| 3:01:39| develop that property and we get it on the tax roll. And yours is a great example, and I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10899)|
| 3:01:44| it would. In other words, you initiated the zoning ordinance request. And what you could have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| is just simply put it on our agenda as a resolution to amend that particular Knox County zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10909)|
| 3:01:56| ordinance, and then explain to us the problem that the developer had had, and then we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10916)|
| 3:02:02| have initiated as an entire body and sent it to MPC, and then they would have start their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10922)|
| 3:02:08| But instead of you being the initiator, it would have been all 11 of us that would have been the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10928)|
| 3:02:13| initiator of it. So when that zoning was denied to that individual who was doing that enclosed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10933)|
| 3:02:19| did they have to file again for another zoning application when it finally got put on the books?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10939)|
| 3:02:26| I don't recall the specifics of that case, Commissioner Busler, but if it got denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10946)|
| 3:02:32| then they probably would have had to reapply unless it was sent back for our reconsideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| And if it was sent back by this board for our reconsideration, then he would not have had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10957)|
| 3:02:41| reapply. But I don't recall the details. Well, anyway, if this takes out a step to where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10961)|
| 3:02:47| can get that on file, but if it's adding a step, someone said it's adding a step, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10967)|
| 3:02:56| Can I answer that? Go ahead. If this body has to pass a resolution, that is a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10976)|
| 3:03:02| It has to go to MPC, that is a step. Then it has to come back to this body, correct, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10982)|
| 3:03:09| If we pass the ordinance, does it have to come back to us? Yeah. Oh, it does? Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10989)|
| 3:03:13| we have to read it twice. Whereas now it goes to MPC, then it comes to us, two steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10993)|
| 3:03:19| Okay. Thank you. Okay, Commissioner Daley. See, I understand. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=10999)|
| 3:03:28| There's before MPC now is a plan growth ordinance, or is that correct, ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11008)|
| 3:03:38| It's like a zoning plan. Yeah. Okay, that was not initiated. That is going to be a written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11018)|
| 3:03:44| into their zoning ordinance. That was not initiated by this commission. It was initiated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11024)|
| 3:03:51| MPC. I did, I know about this, and I was approached by it, and I told them it's a fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11031)|
| 3:03:58| idea, a great idea, but then I look at it this way. We could save a lot of time by me sponsoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11038)|
| 3:04:05| something, or Charlie, or whoever's district is sponsoring a resolution, telling them that we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11045)|
| 3:04:12| this to look at the John Sevier corridor study. I had to get a resolution to do a corridor study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11052)|
| 3:04:19| but I don't have to do a resolution to change our zoning ordinance. It's kind of backwards in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11059)|
| 3:04:25| sense, and I think John's trying to make it look like, you know, let's make it even across the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11065)|
| 3:04:29| board on that. So, you know, I don't, it may, adding a zoning ordinance, if it extends it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11069)|
| 3:04:39| 30 days, that's not going to be a big deal, extend it for 30 days. Mr. Welch may have, it is Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11079)|
| 3:04:46| right? Yes. I thought so. You may have a different opinion on that, but I can see that it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11086)|
| 3:04:52| if a citizen comes to me and asks me to look at a zoning ordinance, then I will go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11092)|
| 3:04:58| talk with the MPC, or I hate your new name, okay? We're all, we're humans, yes. The commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11098)|
| 3:05:07| I like MPC, okay? I will come to MPC and we'd get a resolution through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11107)|
| 3:05:11| the law department to do that. I would like to see it that way, but that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11111)|
| 3:05:17| well, again, I, you know, well, you have other commissioners respond to questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11117)|
| 3:05:23| Okay, Commissioner Anderson. In response to the corridor studies or the mobility study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11123)|
| 3:05:30| you know, we're asking them to perform work that's going to cost money, that's going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11130)|
| 3:05:34| when they come back for their contract, they're going to say, well, you asked us to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| this, and this this year. We didn't have the staff, and so we're authorizing them, in a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11137)|
| 3:05:41| on a corridor study to spend money. An ordinance has nothing, there's no reason to add a step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11141)|
| 3:05:47| because it has no monetary value to MPC. I think that would be the response to the corridor or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11147)|
| 3:05:54| mobility studies or greenway studies or whatever. We're authorizing them on a resolution to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11154)|
| 3:05:58| money, in a sense, whether it's ours or theirs, so. Okay, thank you, Mr. Anderson. If I might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11158)|
| 3:06:05| weigh in on this, you know, what I'm trying to get a hold of on this is to figure out if it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11165)|
| 3:06:09| chicken or an egg kind of situation. In a way, you want to find a way to, to a certain extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11169)|
| 3:06:17| have both, because there may be something that somebody on the front line identifies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| so, and gets that ball rolling, or do they all have to be pushed down by us, or is part of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| the idea behind this change would be when somebody identifies something they come to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11187)|
| 3:06:31| literally one of us, to kind of begin to push it down. And I, I guess, I had a very brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11191)|
| 3:06:39| conversation when I saw it on the agenda, like a five-minute talk with Janice Tosher, the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11199)|
| 3:06:44| chairman, and, you know, she sort of said about the same thing, kind of, they were just taking a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| look at it, so it was more of a, not quite sure if it was a chicken or an egg situation, and frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11208)|
| 3:06:53| John, I told her to give you a call, but not, not, okay, okay, so that was kind of a, my general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11213)|
| 3:07:00| take was trying to figure out if it's a chicken or an egg, if, I think we all know what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11220)|
| 3:07:05| when I say that, so, go ahead, you had, I spoke, we had Commissioner Anders, Charles Bussler's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11225)|
| 3:07:13| light had come on, again, but I'm just trying to go on the agenda, Larson had spoke first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11233)|
| 3:07:19| and then, actually, I guess, if I'm going in order, Larson, that would be you, then Charles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11239)|
| 3:07:24| just based on the order of who's, who's gone, so. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I, I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11244)|
| 3:07:29| might be a, as John put it before, this might be one of those, I think the motion is to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11249)|
| 3:07:35| forward without recommendation, is that correct? And, and get some more context on over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11255)|
| 3:07:39| seven days, so. All right, thank you. All right, Commissioner Bussler. Thank you, I don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11259)|
| 3:07:45| sunshine this, but I want to ask Carse, Commissioner Daley, a question, the airsoft that was supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11265)|
| 3:07:54| to go in South Knoxville, which is a big deal throughout the whole state, how long did it take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11274)|
| 3:07:58| you to get that, I think, is it opened yet? It hasn't opened yet. No, it's not open because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11278)|
| 3:08:04| financial reasons, but it took us three, four months or longer to get it. Yeah. Again, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11284)|
| 3:08:11| this process that you're talking about, would that have shortened it any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11291)|
| 3:08:16| My answer to that would be yes, and my answer to your storage units would be yes, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11296)|
| 3:08:22| MPC could have went to us and said, hey, we need to change the zoning ordinance so that guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11302)|
| 3:08:27| that gentleman can build his storage units. That would have saved 30 days in that case right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11307)|
| 3:08:33| because we were the ones that were going to, we're the ones that overrid it, or overrode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11313)|
| 3:08:39| the decision. That was, he did a use on review up there in Halls and got that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11319)|
| 3:08:44| approved. He went to BZA, he was denied at BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11324)|
| 3:08:54| Okay, so that would have saved 30 days, either way would have saved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11334)|
| 3:08:58| it would save time, Commissioner Anders, and it can cost time, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| Any way that we could save, excuse me, I'm sorry. All right, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11342)|
| 3:09:10| Anything that adds another meeting to any process extends the time that it takes to get something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11350)|
| 3:09:16| done, and this will add another meeting. It'll have to come from one of us, be approved at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11356)|
| 3:09:23| meeting to be sent to MPC, approved at their meeting, and then sent back to us to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11363)|
| 3:09:29| for it to become an ordinance, correct, Mr. Law Director? Two meetings, right. So, we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11369)|
| 3:09:35| from what currently is a three-meeting situation to a four-meeting situation to pass any zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11375)|
| 3:09:44| ordinance. To pass any amendment brought to MPC for a zoning ordinance, but in the case that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11384)|
| 3:09:52| you're discussing, it went from MPC. I'm not going to discuss that. I'm going to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11392)|
| 3:09:58| with the process. Well, the process adds 30 days on the back end or on the front end, in that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11398)|
| 3:10:03| both ends, so it's hard to say. You're adding a 30 days with your vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11403)|
| 3:10:11| but I don't know that that's a net 30 or not net 30, depends on what happens. Depends on what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11411)|
| 3:10:16| other bodies vote up or down on, but that's true of anything we currently have. Could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11416)|
| 3:10:21| Okay, is there any other discussion on this item? Okay, the motion before us is to send forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11421)|
| 3:10:31| no recommendation. All in favor of this motion, please say aye. Aye. All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11431)|
| 3:10:37| Okay, the ayes have it. Madam Clerk. Item number 41 is a resolution approving the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11437)|
| 3:10:45| Government 2019 Voluntary Workforce Reduction Program, resolution 904. Yeah. Make a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11445)|
| 3:10:52| send without recommendation. Second. Okay, a motion's been made by Commissioner Anders and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11452)|
| 3:10:57| seconded by Commissioner Busler. Is there a discussion, Commissioner Anders? Yeah, Dr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11457)|
| 3:11:03| Did you say Dr. Caldwell? Caldwell. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| Hey, Chris, before next week, could you give me some information on the last workforce reduction we did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11466)|
| 3:11:12| Probably already know it. Maybe. How many positions we eliminated? 79. But in the next 18 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11472)|
| 3:11:19| how many we brought back? Well, it'd be none of the same. Okay. None of the same position, but how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11479)|
| 3:11:26| many departments? So, if the Health Department eliminated 10, how many we brought back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11486)|
| 3:11:32| How many departments? So, if the Health Department eliminated 10, did they hire three more somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11492)|
| 3:11:37| else that they didn't have before? Let me, I don't, we watched those and managed. I'm not saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11497)|
| 3:11:44| the one that you have to be careful with is the Sheriff's Office. I mean, there's no doubt. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11504)|
| 3:11:49| still say with those, if you had chiefs that took them, you're bringing back a Corrections Officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11509)|
| 3:11:55| then that's still a law. But there's, that one would be hard to gauge, but I'll get you a listing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11515)|
| 3:12:00| of the 79, and then we'll go back through and see what would be at least close. Okay. And then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11520)|
| 3:12:06| didn't we approve 12 or 16 new positions in the Sheriff's Office last year for the BHUC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11526)|
| 3:12:14| Yes, six, maybe. I don't know if it was 12. I think there was six. There was a total of 12, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11534)|
| 3:12:20| six was, there was six that were related to something else besides that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11540)|
| 3:12:28| They might have added some SROs or something. I think it was something like that. I can't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| exactly, but yeah. If we find out what that number is, because I don't know that they're participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11551)|
| 3:12:35| in the BHUC at that level, and so if we've already added six positions over there for the BHUC and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11555)|
| 3:12:40| they're not participating, we need to have that consideration. But I would like to know on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11560)|
| 3:12:44| last reduction, because I know there were some positions that were eliminated, and in six to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11564)|
| 3:12:51| eight months or 10 months later, the departments were calling for a different position than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11571)|
| 3:12:57| similar role. I know we're losing some higher paid and bringing in some lower paid people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11577)|
| 3:13:04| but eventually, I mean, you can't continue to lose your experience at that cost and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11584)|
| 3:13:12| continue to add those positions and tell everybody we're eliminating, making government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11592)|
| 3:13:15| smaller. Because that was the resolution was to make government smaller, but a lot of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11595)|
| 3:13:20| positions, or some of those positions came back. All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11600)|
| 3:13:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Caldwell, what prompted this? What were the circumstances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11604)|
| 3:13:33| led the mayor and your department to say, hey, this is something we had to try again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11613)|
| 3:13:39| Sure. So as we were going through the budget this year, the mayor was just asking about things in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11619)|
| 3:13:46| general, about things that we had done in the past, and we talked about the voluntary workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11626)|
| 3:13:51| reduction program. He said, tell me about that. So I explained to him that we did it a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11631)|
| 3:13:56| years ago. We had 79 that applied and got approved. It cost $2.4 million to do it. It saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11636)|
| 3:14:09| $4.1 million in year one, and most of that money is going to be reoccurring. We know that on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11649)|
| 3:14:17| medical piece, that it paid for itself in the first six months, and so the ongoing savings there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11657)|
| 3:14:24| that we don't like to measure because we can't look at individuals' piece, but we can look at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11664)|
| 3:14:32| total and look at it as a group. And so I think just the ability to look at savings in a way like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11672)|
| 3:14:39| that I think is appealing to him. And so, listen, we're not going to have 79 again. I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11679)|
| 3:14:47| that's going to happen. I think you may have half that number, but it was a program that worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11687)|
| 3:14:54| well. I thought it was a benefit for not only some employees that are long-tenured, but a benefit to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11694)|
| 3:15:05| the county as well from the standpoint of savings and salary and medical dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11705)|
| 3:15:12| Thank you. Just another quick question. I noticed in the documentation it talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11712)|
| 3:15:19| participants in this program may not be re-employed by Knox County, including both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11719)|
| 3:15:23| the Sheriff's Department, Board of Education, and I would assume the rest of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11723)|
| 3:15:28| for three calendar years. My first thought was, is that long enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11728)|
| 3:15:35| Or then my second thought is, are people, you know, does it really matter? Because our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11735)|
| 3:15:41| once they're out, they're out. Or if they're coming back, are they coming back at zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11741)|
| 3:15:46| so there's no incentive to come back because you're literally starting from a brand new employee? Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11746)|
| 3:15:50| that the case? So it's this. For the most part, and I think this is the vast majority, let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11750)|
| 3:15:59| 95%, once they are retired, they're retired and they're not going to come back in three years is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11759)|
| 3:16:06| a long enough period to where, for the vast majority, they're thinking about coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11766)|
| 3:16:15| For the ones who may try to come back in a different role from the standpoint of maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11775)|
| 3:16:21| they want to do part-time work or something, they would come back, if they have drawn out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11781)|
| 3:16:26| their retirement, they come back at zero, and so there's no benefit to them. If they're part-time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11786)|
| 3:16:32| they're not eligible for benefits at that point anyway. What if they came back full-time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11792)|
| 3:16:38| Would they start back at zero as a brand new employee, or would they kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11798)|
| 3:16:41| be re-put in the system in a level of singularity? They would still be on a defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11801)|
| 3:16:47| contribution plan, so they would come back, and my understanding is zero, so they would be at what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11807)|
| 3:16:52| an entry-level employee would be at. Okay, so there's not an incentive to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11812)|
| 3:16:59| to retire, get the payout, get the extra benefits, get the cash, get the three months of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11819)|
| 3:17:05| this, that, and the other, all the things are listed, sit out for three years, and then come back full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11825)|
| 3:17:10| because they're going to start back at zero. Yeah, we felt three years was long enough because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11830)|
| 3:17:14| ultimately, for the most part, if you're an elected official, that's almost a complete cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11834)|
| 3:17:20| and even in the retirement, when you're on the board, even in the retirement world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11840)|
| 3:17:27| it's four months, and so, you know, I think three years is, a lot of people can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11847)|
| 3:17:35| happiness in three years. It is that dirty. All right, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11855)|
| 3:17:45| Thank you. We've got both Commissioner Daley and Skinmaker. I'll go ahead, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11865)|
| 3:17:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. On the buyout program we did 18 months ago, how many employees were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11869)|
| 3:17:57| eligible for that? Around 830. Okay, and 79 took it, and then of the 79, how many of those are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11877)|
| 3:18:08| Knox County employees? Of the 79? Yeah, that took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11888)|
| 3:18:18| Shouldn't be any. So, zero is your answer then? Correct. Okay, all right, and then on this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11898)|
| 3:18:24| buyout program, it's over 900 that are available for? Yeah, about 920, I think. Okay, and then what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11904)|
| 3:18:32| percentage of that is of our workforce, if theoretically all 920 took it? We basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11912)|
| 3:18:38| have about 2,400 employees. Okay, so you're being a math major, that's what percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11918)|
| 3:18:47| About 40 percent? Yeah. Pardon? Yes. Oh, okay. All right, and if, in your projections, what do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11927)|
| 3:18:58| feel that the number will be that will take advantage of this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11938)|
| 3:19:06| I was just asked that. I threw out 35 to 45. I think it's less than what it was last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11946)|
| 3:19:16| because it's 18 months, right? I just, I don't think it will be what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11956)|
| 3:19:24| Now, that doesn't mean that the savings won't be as great. I think, you know, that comes down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11964)|
| 3:19:29| your pool of employees, what is their salary range and all that stuff, and I think where the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11969)|
| 3:19:37| savings will come in at that we can't pinpoint, of course, but is the savings on medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11977)|
| 3:19:45| Us being self-insured, we fill every dollar that is spent. So, I think our savings, although we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11985)|
| 3:19:52| don't try to quantify it, is on the medical side. Okay, and will this policy be applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11992)|
| 3:19:59| to all fee offices? Yeah, so we have, I have met with all fee offices now. I need to still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=11999)|
| 3:20:08| meet with Howard Hogan. He's not truly a fee office, but I'll meet with him, and they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12008)|
| 3:20:14| all been receptive and want to participate. Okay, thank you. Okay, Commissioner Daly. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12014)|
| 3:20:22| Chris, a lot of my questions have been answered, but I did talk to some associates that wish they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12022)|
| 3:20:29| had taken the early retirement, and I'm sure that they'll take it this time. You may not know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12029)|
| 3:20:33| answer to this question. I don't, do you think that we'll get back to that $2 million, or do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12033)|
| 3:20:38| think it'll be less than that? I mean, you don't know, I understand, but. No, I don't think it will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12038)|
| 3:20:50| I've just jinxed it. Now, I don't think it will cost that. I think it could be in the range of 1.2 to 1.4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12050)|
| 3:21:00| and then we'll see what the savings are based off that number, because we have tweaked a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12060)|
| 3:21:07| the incentives, and so it's a little different than it was 18 months ago. Not a lot differently, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12067)|
| 3:21:12| it's still incentivized, and so I do. I think there's definitely going to be some participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12072)|
| 3:21:23| We've had some interest, and I can't tell you the last 18 months when people have come up to me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12083)|
| 3:21:28| said, when are you doing that again? And my response is always, we're not. And so, I think it's not a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12088)|
| 3:21:37| bad thing. I don't think it's something that we want to do continuously. I think it's okay to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12097)|
| 3:21:43| I just think that once you do it a few times, people start to expect it. And so, I think people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12103)|
| 3:21:56| I think it's a benefit for those employees, and if they think it benefits them and helps them to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12116)|
| 3:22:03| retirement, then we should help them get there. And then we also see the same benefits as an employer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12123)|
| 3:22:15| I believe that six Saturdays and one Sunday is awesome. And also, along Commissioner Anders' concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12135)|
| 3:22:23| was that I think it's a great thing that they take this and we will save money, so I think it's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12143)|
| 3:22:33| that you're looking into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| I'll get his answer to him. A lot of that is going to be a little confusing on the Sheriff's side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12155)|
| 3:22:39| but we'll look into that and see how well we can calculate that, and we'll look at the other departments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12159)|
| 3:22:45| Because, I mean, it is a challenge on that side, there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12165)|
| 3:22:50| All right, thank you. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12170)|
| 3:22:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair. And Chris, I think you just touched on what I want to touch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12172)|
| 3:22:57| The Sheriff's Office and the fee offices, we have really no control over their employee structure other than salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12177)|
| 3:23:07| And going through the list of eligible employees, it looked like a lot of these positions do come from the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12187)|
| 3:23:15| There will be a few of those for sure. A lot in the Sheriff, right? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12195)|
| 3:23:20| And so what we did 18 months ago, which we didn't publish a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12200)|
| 3:23:25| but we had all the fee offices to sign an agreement, which I think I worked with Bud on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12205)|
| 3:23:34| saying that if you accept this, you won't come back and ask for this, this, or this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12214)|
| 3:23:39| And so we kept that, and so we can revisit that to see who did what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12219)|
| 3:23:46| A lot of the challenges, too, is like Kathy Quist would have done it the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12226)|
| 3:23:51| Now Charlie's there, he may have reworked some people in some different roles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12231)|
| 3:23:55| and so we seem to look for things like that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12235)|
| 3:24:01| All right, if I might weigh in briefly on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| At its simplest, when I see these types of programs, and I've seen them in the corporate world as well as the one we recently did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12245)|
| 3:24:11| there's two ways you save.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| You either save by someone takes a retirement plan, and that headcount disappears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12253)|
| 3:24:18| It is a way to shrink the organization by finding a way, sort of laying people off, where you reduce your total labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12258)|
| 3:24:27| The second way these things work is when you have folks who are close to retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12267)|
| 3:24:31| who may be at the higher salary, they retire and take the early retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12271)|
| 3:24:37| and then younger folks are brought in that might not be at the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12277)|
| 3:24:40| maybe do the same basic job, but they're getting paid less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12280)|
| 3:24:46| So at its simplest, my take on this whole program is that we're trying to actually reduce our total workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12286)|
| 3:24:54| But then it does say, I guess our greatest risk, as Commissioner Anderson said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12294)|
| 3:24:58| is when you do a RIF, a reduction of workforce, but then that was smoke and mirrors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12298)|
| 3:25:04| and people end up coming back and getting hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| So if you could just kind of sum up those two points that I brought up on that and our goal for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12307)|
| 3:25:12| We can do that. I will tell you for sure that there were some departments that tried to do what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12312)|
| 3:25:18| and we stopped them and talked to them, and they understood that they couldn't ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12318)|
| 3:25:23| But to clarify, you said what I was saying, which is let somebody retire and then hire somebody a few months later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12323)|
| 3:25:29| So it's very clear our intent is to actually reduce the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12329)|
| 3:25:36| And I'm one that gets a packet this time, too, so I'm excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12336)|
| 3:25:42| Okay, let's see, is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12342)|
| 3:25:48| I think the motion before us was to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12348)|
| 3:25:52| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12352)|

| 3:27:18| Okay, Commissioner Jaffe, I think that was a brief update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12438)|
| 3:27:20| Yes, a very quick update. I want to thank everybody who participated in the planning survey that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12440)|
| 3:27:27| Thank you for your feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| Coming around the horn from Commissioner Buehler is a one-sheet document and it's just simply an update on where we are in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12449)|
| 3:27:39| Just as a recap, I'll wait until that gets around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12459)|
| 3:27:47| The only two action items that have been taken to date are that the county commissioners agreed to hold a strategic planning retreat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12467)|
| 3:27:55| and an information gathering survey was sent to each commissioner electronically that was also posted to our forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12475)|
| 3:28:01| The results of the survey, as you'll see in the breakdown, the following recommendation I'm moving forward with here, what I'm presenting to you today, is based on these survey results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12481)|
| 3:28:13| The result being the majority of people that wanted the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12493)|
| 3:28:19| A two-day retreat to hold this retreat after the budget time frame of this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12499)|
| 3:28:27| The dates being split between the business week and the business weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12507)|
| 3:28:33| There are some dates proposed below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| We're holding the retreat in town, not out of town, not including a social component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12515)|
| 3:28:41| People were very interested in some pre-retreat information, articles, books, etc. to be sent in advance as part of the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12521)|
| 3:28:51| I bring before the commission today two proposed dates, which would be a Friday-Saturday in July after our fiscal cycle for our budget approval in the beginning of our fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12531)|
| 3:29:03| I'd love to have everybody look at their calendars and maybe move forward with one of those two weekends there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12543)|
| 3:29:09| Holding the retreat here in Knox County, I'm still vetting out several locations for the potential retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12549)|
| 3:29:17| A few suggestions that people made through the surveys for places that might also be free are good. I'm working on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12557)|
| 3:29:27| I'm proposing that we, as a facilitator, again looking at various facilitators for planning retreats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12567)|
| 3:29:34| is that we would engage the Alliance for Better Nonprofits to facilitate the retreat, specifically facilitator Jerry Askew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12574)|
| 3:29:43| Many of you may know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| In full disclosure, I am a board member of the Alliance for Better Nonprofits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12585)|
| 3:29:49| but in looking at all the individuals and other companies that might do this, I did feel that they were the best fit for what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12589)|
| 3:29:58| There's a brief description below of who they are and what they do, and some credentials for, it's actually Dr. Jerry Askew below that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12598)|
| 3:30:07| who has held many of these retreats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12607)|
| 3:30:10| I'm still gathering information on potential expense, but I'm estimating that expense being somewhere between $3,000 and $5,000 all in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12610)|
| 3:30:19| Again, still gathering information, and I look forward to bringing a final proposal to you all in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12619)|
| 3:30:25| but I wanted to give you this, answer any questions, and try to lock in a date before we leave today as our next action item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12625)|
| 3:30:32| Sounds good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12632)|
| 3:30:35| Commissioner Anders, your light was on just a second ago. Did you want to weigh in on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12635)|
| 3:30:38| Well, I know that we could use, I mean, if there's no line item budget in travel or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12638)|
| 3:30:44| we might be able to take it out of travel, but we could also take it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12644)|
| 3:30:48| everybody put a little money in from their discretionary account to pay for this if we can't take it out of travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12648)|
| 3:30:54| Chris, if it cost any money, would it be eligible for training and travel? It's a retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12654)|
| 3:31:03| I don't have any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| It should probably be next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12666)|
| 3:31:08| Not what you were saying in the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12668)|
| 3:31:11| You're not supposed to listen to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12671)|
| 3:31:13| City Council just had theirs this past weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12673)|
| 3:31:16| So if you want to do a retreat, you're saying like in town, $3,000 to $5,000, does that come out of travel and training?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12676)|
| 3:31:25| It can, or we can, and what we could do, we also have an account called an official's expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12685)|
| 3:31:33| We could charge it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12693)|
| 3:31:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12694)|
| 3:31:35| And so if you just have the chairman to work with me and then we can work on it, that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12695)|
| 3:31:39| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12699)|
| 3:31:40| All right, thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12700)|
| 3:31:41| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12701)|
| 3:31:43| Yes, I sent to Commissioner Jay, Johnson University has gladly offered everything free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12703)|
| 3:31:52| If you want to stay on, if it's a Friday night, you can stay Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12712)|
| 3:31:55| They'll put us up, all meals, the meeting room, and accommodations at Johnson University.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12715)|
| 3:32:01| That is one of the people that I'm in discussion with now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12721)|
| 3:32:04| They're checking dates, so that's one of three options that I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12724)|
| 3:32:07| I think that would exceed $50 a day, and we need to be careful on the free part and at least get back their hard cost for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12727)|
| 3:32:14| Well, we can, if it's an option, we'll look at what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12734)|
| 3:32:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12740)|
| 3:32:21| You mean what they would donate to us, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12741)|
| 3:32:25| Well, I mean, if you're taking meals and, you know, if you get two meals on two different days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12745)|
| 3:32:33| or three meals over the day and you're spending the night there, I mean, it's better to err on the side of caution of perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12753)|
| 3:32:41| than it is anything else, so at least get their hard cost back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12761)|
| 3:32:47| I'll look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12767)|
| 3:32:48| I'll make that a note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12768)|
| 3:32:49| Look into that, and, yeah, Brad's got a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| Is there any other discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12772)|
| 3:32:55| The dates would be helpful if anybody could weigh in on one versus the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12775)|
| 3:33:01| I know I'm speaking just for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12781)|
| 3:33:03| I'm going to need to check on the summer swim schedule to see if I'm refereeing any of those weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12783)|
| 3:33:06| and these dates may be ones we bring back to you Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12786)|
| 3:33:09| I will, yeah, either bring it back Monday or I could post this to the forum and you all could weigh in, either one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12789)|
| 3:33:14| but it's going to be very hard to plan it unless we narrow it down to one weekend, so if everybody could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12794)|
| 3:33:20| I'll post this on the forum tonight and everybody could weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12800)|
| 3:33:22| That would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12802)|
| 3:33:23| Also, I have not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12803)|
| 3:33:25| I met once or sat down once and talked about the curriculum and sort of that is not mapped out enough to present to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12805)|
| 3:33:33| but I hope in the next May meeting I'll be able to come with here's what we're going to do over the next couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12813)|
| 3:33:40| you know, over that two-day retreat so that everybody has an idea of what kind of content we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12820)|
| 3:33:44| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12824)|
| 3:33:46| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12826)|
| 3:33:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12827)|
| 3:33:48| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12828)|
| 3:33:50| Okay, I've got, we've gone through the agenda that we had set earlier this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12830)|
| 3:33:54| The one final thing that I actually had mentioned that I wanted to try to get done tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12834)|
| 3:33:58| and we'll hopefully have this done before 9 o'clock, is, oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12838)|
| 3:34:03| I'm waiting to do the announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12843)|
| 3:34:04| Okay, announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12844)|
| 3:34:05| Yeah, we'll get to announcements in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12845)|
| 3:34:08| At last month's meeting I brought up the need to get our budget set meetings scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12848)|
| 3:34:12| and we did map out several dates and times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12852)|
| 3:34:15| and fortunately after we did the follow-up on it we found that there were some conflicts with this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12855)|
| 3:34:20| or the room next door, and one thing we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12860)|
| 3:34:23| we actually scheduled one of our planning sessions at the exact same time that the Planning Commission was actually meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12863)|
| 3:34:28| So what I want to share with you all is I've got multiple dates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12868)|
| 3:34:35| and Drusilla, I'm looking at you because I know you provided me with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12875)|
| 3:34:39| Drusilla's been extremely helpful in trying to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| I've reserved a lot of dates, and we may not want to keep them all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12881)|
| 3:34:46| and I also know the dates that, with Drusilla's help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12886)|
| 3:34:49| that other dates and times that the meeting room may be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12889)|
| 3:34:54| Here's what we have on hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12894)|
| 3:34:57| May 6th at 3 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12897)|
| 3:35:02| Can you tell us what the dates were that we chose in the first place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12902)|
| 3:35:05| We had May 9th on hold, which was my birthday, just a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12905)|
| 3:35:10| So we had May 9th on hold, and we had May 30th on hold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12910)|
| 3:35:15| and they both created conflicts, or that was our request coming out of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12915)|
| 3:35:21| We have May 6th at 3 o'clock is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12921)|
| 3:35:25| May 15th at 3 o'clock is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12925)|
| 3:35:28| May 20th at 3 p.m. is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12928)|
| 3:35:31| May 29th at 3 p.m. is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12931)|
| 3:35:34| and May 31st at 3 p.m. is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12934)|
| 3:35:38| Mr. Sill, have I got all those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12938)|
| 3:35:41| Are those the dates we've kind of got on hold right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| Yeah, the meeting's down at 4 o'clock, but you can get in the room at 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12943)|
| 3:35:47| Yeah, that's when the room is available, yeah, but our meeting could start at 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12947)|
| 3:35:50| I think one thing to know is that it might be easier to do these either at 3.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12950)|
| 3:35:53| or a little earlier in the day in case we have to ask department heads questions pertaining to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12953)|
| 3:35:57| Well, I would propose to get rid of the 20th because that is the work session date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12957)|
| 3:36:02| and us having enough time to do budget before work session is slim to none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12962)|
| 3:36:07| so I would say get rid of that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12967)|
| 3:36:10| Well, May 6th would be shortly after the budget has been presented to us, which might be helpful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| and my personal inclination was to go with one early and then one later, maybe May 6th and May 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12974)|
| 3:36:21| That would give a lot of time to do research, get that initial snapshot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12981)|
| 3:36:26| then about a week or two to do a lot of research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12986)|
| 3:36:29| and then to come back to drill down on the 29th before we vote on it on June 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12989)|
| 3:36:36| The 31st is Memorial Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12996)|
| 3:36:39| Well, it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=12999)|
| 3:36:42| I'm just saying the room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13002)|
| 3:36:45| Enjoy that meeting, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13005)|
| 3:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13010)|
| 3:36:52| Can we just clarify something, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13012)|
| 3:36:54| We have the communications director for Knox County here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13014)|
| 3:36:57| so could he come down to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| I just asked him a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13019)|
| 3:37:00| I think, yeah, we've got questions about one-on-one meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| We've also got the announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13023)|
| 3:37:04| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13024)|
| 3:37:05| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13025)|
| 3:37:06| Rob, approach the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13026)|
| 3:37:12| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13032)|
| 3:37:14| Rob Link, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13034)|
| 3:37:17| Are we still on track for May 1st for the budget presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13037)|
| 3:37:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13041)|
| 3:37:22| We should be announcing that officially maybe as soon as tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13042)|
| 3:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13047)|
| 3:37:28| So are you leaning towards the morning or afternoon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13048)|
| 3:37:31| High noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13051)|
| 3:37:32| Keep my options open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13052)|
| 3:37:35| We're leaning toward morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13055)|
| 3:37:38| We're just waiting on final confirmation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13058)|
| 3:37:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13060)|
| 3:37:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| Commissioner Smith, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13065)|
| 3:37:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13066)|
| 3:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13067)|
| 3:37:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13068)|
| 3:37:49| Do you know if the mayor is planning on doing individual meetings with the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13069)|
| 3:37:52| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13072)|
| 3:37:55| Chris, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13075)|
| 3:38:05| Would everybody except you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13085)|
| 3:38:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13086)|
| 3:38:08| We're going to schedule those, and so I'm sure that Brad will be calling soon to set those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13088)|
| 3:38:14| I don't know the exact dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| I know, depending on his schedule, but we talked about doing them like seven to ten days out, which is normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13096)|
| 3:38:23| Doing them prior to the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13105)|
| 3:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13108)|
| 3:38:30| What I'd like to add in closing, how does May 6th and May 29th sound as our two budget workshops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13110)|
| 3:38:39| I'm seeing a thumbs up from Commissioner Beeler, and this is not something we necessarily have to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13119)|
| 3:38:43| I'm ready to just roll with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| So those will be the dates planned on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| We have access to this room at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13127)|
| 3:38:50| I'll probably schedule meetings probably for either 3, 30, or 4 o'clock in time to be able to have our staff meet with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13130)|
| 3:38:57| So that will be May 6th and May 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| And if you're always looking for an easy victim, it's Recode's got the room on the 30th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13141)|
| 3:39:06| so I probably figured we'd want to stay away from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13146)|
| 3:39:09| Stay far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13149)|
| 3:39:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13150)|
| 3:39:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13152)|
| 3:39:13| That's all the business that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13153)|
| 3:39:14| I'd like to move on to announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13154)|
| 3:39:16| Go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13156)|
| 3:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13158)|
| 3:39:19| Coming Thursday at 7 p.m. at Sharon Baptist Church, we're having the Last Supper by Da Vinci,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13159)|
| 3:39:29| and it's going to be played there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| And, yes, I'm in the play, and they cast me as the dreaded tax collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13172)|
| 3:39:39| What time was this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| Thursday, what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13183)|
| 3:39:44| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13184)|
| 3:39:45| Earlier, Commissioner Schoonmaker and I, during the Finance Committee meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13185)|
| 3:39:50| talked about maybe holding a joint session with or a combined session with the Joint Education Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13190)|
| 3:39:57| and the Finance Committee to do the school's budget, to look at the school's budget specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13197)|
| 3:40:02| That was on our agenda for this week, but they informed us last week that it was not going to be voted upon in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13202)|
| 3:40:08| and so we needed to move the meeting back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13208)|
| 3:40:10| But it's sort of set for May 22nd, but it was some discussion about whether or not we just take one of the dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13210)|
| 3:40:16| that have been set for our other budget meeting and maybe add some time to really do a deep dive into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13216)|
| 3:40:22| So I might propose, instead of having the Joint Education meeting on the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13222)|
| 3:40:27| that we just slate the schools to come and also talk about their budget on the 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13227)|
| 3:40:32| and invite both the members of the Joint Education Committee as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13232)|
| 3:40:36| and our Finance Committee will already be here because it's all of our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13236)|
| 3:40:39| Does that suit everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13239)|
| 3:40:42| And the school, yeah, members as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13242)|
| 3:40:46| So basically what we'll need you to do is extend an invitation to them and let them know that we've got, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13246)|
| 3:40:51| So we will ask the school district to have somebody available on the 6th to look at their budget as well as the comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13251)|
| 3:40:59| One quick point of direction from this body is 4 o'clock the time that you all would like to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13259)|
| 3:41:03| or would we have access to this room at 3, would 3 be better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13263)|
| 3:41:06| All right, I'd prefer 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13266)|
| 3:41:08| Let's go at 3 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13268)|
| 3:41:09| Okay, so I will invite members of the Joint Education Committee to the 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13269)|
| 3:41:16| and then we will cancel the meeting on the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13276)|
| 3:41:19| And I spoke to the school staff this evening, and they said they're agreeable to doing like we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13279)|
| 3:41:25| Okay, well, we'll all be there anyway because, I mean, it is our Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13285)|
| 3:41:29| You're speaking of the whole school board, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13291)|
| 3:41:33| No, no, just the members, the four members that are on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13293)|
| 3:41:36| Administration, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13296)|
| 3:41:39| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13299)|
| 3:41:42| All right, are there any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13302)|
| 3:41:44| Chick-fil-A closes in an hour. We need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13304)|
| 3:41:46| Okay, I'll accept that as a motion for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13306)|
| 3:41:49| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190415?start=13311)|
