| 2:29:07| And so as an event happens, then we increase what we ask from the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| So workers' comp, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| And I also wanted to make a note that we did include a new person for clerical support of the new juvenile referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8955)|
| 2:29:21| So that's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8961)|
| 2:29:22| And the salary amount is $24,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8965)|
| 2:29:26| Also in the civil sessions clerk office, there's a near doubling of the equipment budget from 8,502 to 15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8966)|
| 2:29:33| In a time of tight budget, what's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| Let me, I'll be more than glad to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:38| In 2006, our court handled 15,564 new filings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8978)|
| 2:29:45| That is just new warrants in the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| And one thing the clerk has required by annotated code is we must furnish all documents to both attorneys and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:56| And then in 2007, we had 18,018 new warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=8996)|
| 2:30:02| As of the end of April, we had 6,910 new warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9002)|
| 2:30:08| And on projection for going by the end of the year 2008, that's showing 20,730 projected new warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9008)|
| 2:30:17| That's a lot of warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9017)|
| 2:30:18| What does it have to do with the equipment budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| We have to have copy machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9020)|
| 2:30:22| We have to make all the warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9022)|
| 2:30:25| Those are not furnished by the attorneys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| The court clerk's office must furnish all the warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9027)|
| 2:30:30| We have detainer warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9030)|
| 2:30:31| We have writ of possessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| We have civil warrants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9032)|
| 2:30:34| We have garnishment forms, which is five different colors of NCR paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9034)|
| 2:30:40| That's one of the most expensive forms that we have to furnish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:44| And last year in 2007, our garnishment clerks, two garnishment clerks, had over 7,000 garnishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9044)|
| 2:30:51| and bank levies go out of our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9051)|
| 2:30:53| That sounds like it explains the office supplies question better than the equipment question, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:57| Well, on the equipment, we have to have copy machines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| I am required or the court clerk is required to furnish when an attorney wants a certified copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9061)|
| 2:31:07| Certified copies are taken over to the register of deeds office where the plaintiff usually registers a property lien,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:14| and we must make those copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| And then a lot of attorney wants just a regular copy for their records, and we must furnish that to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9076)|
| 2:31:21| And we have two copiers that's handling making over 20,000 new warrants plus any copies that come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9081)|
| 2:31:29| Are you adding new copying machines or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:32| So why are we going from 8,502 to 15,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9092)|
| 2:31:35| Because we projected an increase due to the vendor that we deal with because they go up on the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9095)|
| 2:31:40| and rental maintenance agreements every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| Based on the volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9103)|
| 2:31:44| Based on the volume, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:45| And we've also been going over the number of copies allotted on our rental agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9105)|
| 2:31:51| You might want to look at a different arrangement where you're not charged per amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| That's what we're doing, and that's why we've asked for more money in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9114)|
| 2:31:59| Thank you, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9119)|
| 2:32:01| PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:04| I didn't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9124)|
| 2:32:10| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9130)|
| 2:32:11| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9131)|
| 2:32:12| I'm Kathy Maness, the finance director for the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| Mr. Smith's out of town in California today, so he couldn't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9134)|
| 2:32:19| Happy to be here to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9139)|
| 2:32:23| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9143)|
| 2:32:25| I'd just like to know what unit number or budget number do we need to look at for PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| Is it all over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9154)|
| 2:32:35| Yeah, it's spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9155)|
| 2:32:36| It's space costs, and so it would be some in every different office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9156)|
| 2:32:41| Well, what's the total space cost for this building for the county taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| For this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9166)|
| 2:32:48| We own and operate this building, and it's a lease to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9168)|
| 2:32:54| Total cost for this building for the county, $2.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9174)|
| 2:33:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9184)|
| 2:33:05| Out of that $2.9, is that to cover your electric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9185)|
| 2:33:10| That's all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9190)|
| 2:33:11| What's the electric bill, our part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| It would be two-thirds of $1.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9193)|
| 2:33:18| The electric bill's one-third of $2.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9198)|
| 2:33:21| Two-thirds is the county's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:22| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9202)|
| 2:33:23| Rough share of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9203)|
| 2:33:26| Two-thirds, one-third is the way it breaks down between county and city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| $1.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9210)|
| 2:33:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9211)|
| 2:33:32| So what's left out of the $2.9?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:36| We have, of course, our liability insurance, our employee costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9216)|
| 2:33:41| For this building, we provide security, maintenance services, custodial services, and ground services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9221)|
| 2:33:51| We have our employee costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9231)|
| 2:33:54| We have our operating expenses, which are supplies and materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| We have our operating contracts, which a large part of that's custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9238)|
| 2:34:04| Communications, insurance, property insurance, because we carry our property insurance on this building since we own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9244)|
| 2:34:11| And some professional services and capital purchases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9251)|
| 2:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| Is there a way you can get us a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:19| I didn't know whether you didn't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9259)|
| 2:34:22| Well, we may have it, but I've got six inches, and I didn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9262)|
| 2:34:26| I couldn't find the unit number of the total budget, so it's hard to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9266)|
| 2:34:31| I'd be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| And you also operate an A.J. building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9274)|
| 2:34:37| We operate several properties for the county, 35 different facilities under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9277)|
| 2:34:44| various services, sometimes custodial, security, maintenance, grounds, depending on the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9284)|
| 2:34:50| Is there a way you could get me a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| I don't know if anybody else would like to have one, but a copy of your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| And how many employees do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| 126.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9303)|
| 2:35:04| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9304)|
| 2:35:07| Are we going to be bidding out the grounds and the janitorial, John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| For the libraries, the health department, and the senior centers, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:17| So would that reduce the PBA budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:19| It's already out of our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9319)|
| 2:35:21| We've been working with John to remove those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9321)|
| 2:35:26| I guess the big question that has come up is the space costs and why the space costs are so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| Is it based on square footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| What is it based on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9336)|
| 2:35:38| Space costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9338)|
| 2:35:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9339)|
| 2:35:40| The public building authority operates at cost for the city and the county and our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9340)|
| 2:35:46| And it's strictly the cost, utilities, insurance, supplies of materials, custodial costs, strictly listed at cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9346)|
| 2:35:56| In addition to this building, what other buildings are you responsible for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9356)|
| 2:35:59| Are you responsible for the A.J. building and the libraries, senior citizen centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9359)|
| 2:36:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9363)|
| 2:36:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9364)|
| 2:36:05| For the county, we operate the Andrew Johnson building and the Kessel Garage, the Family Investment Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:15| the John Tarleton Homes, the Juvenile Justice Center, Knox Central, the health department locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:23| the library system in their locations, the old courthouse, the five senior centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:28| and then the State Street parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9388)|
| 2:36:32| This budget is just the county budget, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| What is the city budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9395)|
| 2:36:37| The city budget for property management is $2.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9397)|
| 2:36:48| So the total budget is $6.8 million, no $5.8 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| Our total budget is a little over $11 million because we also provide telecommunications services for the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9412)|
| 2:37:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9421)|
| 2:37:08| How much is our phone service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| Your contract numbers are in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9431)|
| 2:37:14| They're not in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9434)|
| 2:37:15| But our costs for providing telecommunications services are $245,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9435)|
| 2:37:25| and that includes the repair technicians and the PBX system in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9445)|
| 2:37:33| Here's something that I want to address with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| I want to look at the parking in this garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9456)|
| 2:37:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9458)|
| 2:37:40| I'm hearing some people pay to park, some people don't pay to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9460)|
| 2:37:46| And I've got a list right here of who pays to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9466)|
| 2:37:53| But I don't know how that correlates with the rest of the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9473)|
| 2:37:58| I want to know, as a commissioner, who gets free parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9478)|
| 2:38:05| and who all has one of these to get in that is not an employee of Knox County, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9485)|
| 2:38:17| And then I want to know of the employees at Knox County that get free parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9497)|
| 2:38:24| I'm hearing clerks in some offices get to park for free and other people don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9504)|
| 2:38:31| If a clerk in one office or employee or supervisor, whoever that person is, gets to park for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| then that means we as taxpayers are paying because somebody is paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9518)|
| 2:38:42| That's coming out of somebody's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| I just want a level playing field for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9525)|
| 2:38:49| Because you come into the parking garage right now on a Monday morning from 830 to 11 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| you can't find a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| It is so covered up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| I understand NPC commissioners get free parking and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9541)|
| 2:39:05| And there's other people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9545)|
| 2:39:07| I just think we need to know who all is getting in the garage and who's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9547)|
| 2:39:13| Commissioner, I'll get you the list of who has the badges to get in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| As far as the employees and who pays and who doesn't, I'd have to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| Well, we need somebody to correlate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| I don't know if we have to go, John, if we have to go through human resources to get this, you know, correlate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9564)|
| 2:39:31| But I think the public needs to know who gets in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:36| I mean, it comes out to a dollar and a quarter a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9576)|
| 2:39:41| Next door, it's $90 a month to park next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| You know, we're talking about tight budget times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| To me, this is another no-brainer that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| We've been advocating increased monthly prices in parking with our two clients, the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9591)|
| 2:40:00| Well, I just want to know, you know, if you're a county employee, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| and commissioners, you know, put our names out there, you know, that we're not paying the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| If we need to pay, we need to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:15| John, how can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9615)|
| 2:40:17| We will be glad to provide a list of all the people that we deduct through payroll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9617)|
| 2:40:22| I've got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9622)|
| 2:40:23| I've got the payroll list, but that doesn't tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:26| Let's just, I'm just going to pull one out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9626)|
| 2:40:28| Let's take some judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9628)|
| 2:40:30| That doesn't tell me all the people that are employed in the judge's office or the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| or the sheriff's office or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9635)|
| 2:40:37| You know, I'm not wanting to charge the sheriff's department, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| the guys and women that have their cruisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9640)|
| 2:40:43| I know, you know, there's in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| But I want a full list of employees that have a badge that are using this parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9645)|
| 2:40:56| Now, some of them may go over here to the Dwight Kessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| Do you get free parking at Dwight Kessler if this is full?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9659)|
| 2:41:01| I mean, what's going on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:05| If the employee has a badge, has a card, it's not a badge, a card at Kessler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| then they would be paying the same rate there unless they're with a fee office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9672)|
| 2:41:17| or something that, of course, is picking that up for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9677)|
| 2:41:19| But most of the employees that park in the Kessler garage are school employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9684)|
| 2:41:25| You know, and here's what I'm getting at, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9685)|
| 2:41:28| If we open this garage today, people come in and pay their taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| and do what they need to, go to offices and whatnot, carry on their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:37| They couldn't even find a place to park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9697)|
| 2:41:39| I'm thinking we're being abused by some people and or attorneys that have these parking passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9699)|
| 2:41:47| We need to see who's using it and who isn't and let the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9707)|
| 2:41:52| And if we've got some space, then let the public get in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9712)|
| 2:41:55| This is their garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9715)|
| 2:41:57| Actually, with the cruisers, city and the county, state patrol and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| we're actually oversubscribed as far as spaces and cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:04| But you have, you know, flux during the day, so we've been able to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9724)|
| 2:42:09| You know, your cruisers are pretty much in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9729)|
| 2:42:11| Commissioner Smith, I think we need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:14| Commissioner Smith, I will coordinate with John to get you a comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9734)|
| 2:42:17| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9737)|
| 2:42:18| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| I just now did a search in the proposed budget of space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| since that's what you had said that it's in our designated PBA cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| There is 91 instances in this document when I did a search of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9752)|
| 2:42:37| Now, all of these, are you saying that all of these, then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9757)|
| 2:42:39| are related to public building authority, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9759)|
| 2:42:42| There are some instances, like, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| a county clerk that is charged rent at Easttown, and that is labeled as a space rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9770)|
| 2:42:51| So the rentals are not associated, then, with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9774)|
| 2:42:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9775)|
| 2:42:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9776)|
| 2:42:57| How come PBA did not have to submit a chart similar to everybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9777)|
| 2:43:01| that talks about their full-time regular pay, their part-time, their retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9781)|
| 2:43:05| their health insurance, their equipment, their contractual services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9785)|
| 2:43:08| Why did PBA not have to submit anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:11| I understand that they're going to provide you with those budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9791)|
| 2:43:17| Yeah, but why was it not in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:18| I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9798)|
| 2:43:19| It's not indexed in any table of contents, and to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9799)|
| 2:43:25| just put it sporadically through without actually labeling what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9805)|
| 2:43:29| it just seems ludicrous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9809)|
| 2:43:33| As PBA is an independent entity, they're not county employees specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| but this obviously is tax dollars, and we're glad to provide you what you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| I'd also like to have, I would want to know what their assets are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| since they do own the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:50| I want to know what all of their assets are and what those total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| I think for a quasi-government entity, I mean, I was at the public library the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9835)|
| 2:43:59| and I saw a PBA truck pull up, and they really did just come in to change a light bulb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:05| I thought that was purely rumor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| I could not believe they traveled all the way out to South Mossel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| just to change one light bulb and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9850)|
| 2:44:12| And so with gas prices these days, I want to know what their assets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9852)|
| 2:44:17| I want to know how much that totals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9857)|
| 2:44:26| Can you get that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:28| Yeah, we'll be glad to work with Ms. Maness about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9868)|
| 2:44:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9871)|
| 2:44:32| And provide it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| Commissioner Pinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:34| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9874)|
| 2:44:36| Going back to what Commissioner Smith was talking about, about this parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| here a few months ago the mayor and I believe approximately about five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9880)|
| 2:44:44| of his people when I was checking parking in and out of the garage here, they had two parking passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9884)|
| 2:44:51| Now, since then they've turned them in when I called them on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| but nobody should have two parking passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| That's a security problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9896)|
| 2:44:58| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| They may be giving these passes to other people going in and out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| and I would like for nobody to ever have to again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| Back on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:06| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9906)|
| 2:45:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:09| Who is the top paid official at PBA, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| Bill Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9913)|
| 2:45:14| And what's his salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| I want to say probably $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9919)|
| 2:45:21| I didn't bring our salary schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| Does he have any other thing like expense accounts or supplemental salaries, car allowance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9923)|
| 2:45:29| That would be inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9932)|
| 2:45:33| John, the $245,000 they're saying is phone service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| Is that exactly what we take out of people or do we, if we go through this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9937)|
| 2:45:42| is it going to be more than $245,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| We try to match up PBA's communication costs with our costs, try to match it up directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9945)|
| 2:45:52| Now, there are some instances of communication costs that's outside of what PBA provides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9952)|
| 2:45:57| and some offices do have other contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| What's the total phones being taken out of this budget, phone service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9961)|
| 2:46:06| Yeah, we'd be glad to give you a consolidated list of communications charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9966)|
| 2:46:10| if that's what you're wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9970)|
| 2:46:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| I guess, Ms. Maness, I'm confused, because you said your total budget was $11 million, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9978)|
| 2:46:23| Consolidated budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9983)|
| 2:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9984)|
| 2:46:25| And then you said our portion of that is $2.9 million, and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9985)|
| 2:46:30| City-county billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9990)|
| 2:46:31| Just for the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9991)|
| 2:46:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9992)|
| 2:46:33| What is Knox County's portion of that $11 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| The city-county billing would be $2.9, and property management, it's roughly $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=9998)|
| 2:46:47| So the other $2 million, is that what the city pays you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10007)|
| 2:46:51| We pay $9, and then the city pays probably $2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| The city pays under $2 million for this building, based upon their space cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| and then we also have property management contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| You're telling me then that $11 million is just for this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10023)|
| 2:47:07| Or is this your total budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| Total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10028)|
| 2:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10029)|
| 2:47:10| And then of your total budget, $9 million is the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10030)|
| 2:47:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10035)|
| 2:47:16| And then $2 is city, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| My question then is, when we were meeting with the school board the other evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| they had told us, Mr. Troyer, that $1.5 million for their communication costs that they contracted with PBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10043)|
| 2:47:31| that we were paying, was now part of their school budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10051)|
| 2:47:36| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10056)|
| 2:47:37| That's the budget proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10057)|
| 2:47:38| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| But as I understood it, they were going to try to see if they could find an outside service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| or someone else to renegotiate that, that they felt that they could find a cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10064)|
| 2:47:48| Has that been reflected in our budget, in that PBA budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10068)|
| 2:47:52| In our budget, and PBA reports it, and Ms. Maness may correct me on this as just a pass-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10072)|
| 2:48:00| That's not part of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10080)|
| 2:48:01| That's their contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10081)|
| 2:48:03| We manage those contracts at present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:07| AT&T and the beepers, the cell phones and so forth, those are not in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10087)|
| 2:48:15| We just manage those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10095)|
| 2:48:17| But are there not costs associated with managing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10097)|
| 2:48:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| So would that not be reflected in your budget as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10101)|
| 2:48:23| Would that not decrease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10103)|
| 2:48:25| And that would be $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10105)|
| 2:48:32| And $300,000 is just for the phone service for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10112)|
| 2:48:37| That is managing those contracts, having the techs go out and do the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10117)|
| 2:48:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| Management of costs for the school system was $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| And you said managing for us, for the county, is $245,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10126)|
| 2:48:56| I wouldn't see that we would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10139)|
| 2:49:00| That just seems like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| I would like to know when we could get the breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| I know that you had said that you would give us a more itemized and detailed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10150)|
| 2:49:15| We need to see that pretty soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| I would like to see it before next Wednesday when we have our grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10161)|
| 2:49:22| To you this afternoon, I didn't realize you didn't have our budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10165)|
| 2:49:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10166)|
| 2:49:30| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10176)|
| 2:50:02| Good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| I'm Eric Hogan, Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10204)|
| 2:50:06| I'm happy with my budget, and I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10206)|
| 2:50:12| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10212)|
| 2:50:15| Eric, what's your fund numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10215)|
| 2:50:18| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10218)|
| 2:50:19| Where is it taken out of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| What's your account numbers, fund numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| Oh, it's account number 1005105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10224)|
| 2:50:32| Is that the only account you take out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10232)|
| 2:50:34| No, that is the county's portion of the administrative part of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10234)|
| 2:50:44| We also get 105, that is the grant fund, 0410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10244)|
| 2:50:53| That's all of our CDBG money that the county receives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10253)|
| 2:50:57| And that goes to all of our agencies, our admin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10257)|
| 2:51:00| That's everything CDBG grant related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| And then we also have 1050415.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10262)|
| 2:51:08| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10268)|
| 2:51:09| Do that one again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10269)|
| 2:51:10| 1050415.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10270)|
| 2:51:16| That's the home money that the county receives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| And then I think the actual community grants are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10281)|
| 2:51:32| it looks like it's 1005110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10292)|
| 2:51:38| Those are the actual community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10298)|
| 2:51:46| Okay, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10307)|
| 2:51:53| Eric, this looks like your budget in actuality was $150,931 in 07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10313)|
| 2:52:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| You know, you're doubling this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10324)|
| 2:52:06| You're going to 348 in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10326)|
| 2:52:09| What are you doing different down there that you need so much more money for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10329)|
| 2:52:15| Most of that will be our personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10335)|
| 2:52:19| I think, in fact, all of that is personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10339)|
| 2:52:22| Are you hiring more people, is that it, or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10342)|
| 2:52:24| No, the next account unit below that was community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10344)|
| 2:52:30| And if you'll notice, that's zeroed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10350)|
| 2:52:32| So two of those employees that were being paid out of community services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10352)|
| 2:52:36| are now being paid out of community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10356)|
| 2:52:39| And I think that's, you'll see, is the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10359)|
| 2:52:42| You know, you went from $150,000 to $229,000 in 08,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10362)|
| 2:52:46| and now you're going up to, it looks like you only requested $286,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10366)|
| 2:52:51| A lot, too, the other thing with our budget is we do direct billing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10371)|
| 2:52:56| So when I work on HUD-related items, whatever that might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10376)|
| 2:53:04| if one day I spend eight hours working on a consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10384)|
| 2:53:10| HUD gets billed that complete eight hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10390)|
| 2:53:12| So it's all going to depend on the work that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10392)|
| 2:53:17| If I'm doing community grant stuff, then Knox County will get billed for my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10397)|
| 2:53:22| We also have another employee that is in the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10402)|
| 2:53:28| It really concerns me that if everybody up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10408)|
| 2:53:31| if their budget doubled in two years, more than doubled in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10411)|
| 2:53:35| we're really going to be in bad shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| I think if you look at what we give back to the general fund at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10417)|
| 2:53:42| we don't spend what we're budgeted in our salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| Who did this Department of Community Development, how long has this been in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10425)|
| 2:53:52| Well, I've been here five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10432)|
| 2:53:56| I think around 2003, I believe, is when the 1005-105 account came on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10436)|
| 2:54:06| 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10446)|
| 2:54:08| Who did this work before we started the community development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10448)|
| 2:54:14| We've always had the community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10454)|
| 2:54:18| It was 100% paid out of grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10458)|
| 2:54:23| But that's when we only did HUD grant-related activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10463)|
| 2:54:27| When community development was given the charge of doing community grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10467)|
| 2:54:33| then that's when the 105-105 account came into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10473)|
| 2:54:40| Well, who did the community grants before community development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10480)|
| 2:54:44| I guess it was the county executive and finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10484)|
| 2:54:51| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10491)|
| 2:54:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| I'll have to yield to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10494)|
| 2:54:55| Well, it looks like we're creating something here that we don't need then if they did it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10495)|
| 2:55:00| I'd like to just jump in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10500)|
| 2:55:02| If you look at the next unit code, the 1005-110 Community Services Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10502)|
| 2:55:08| last year the approved budget was $416,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10508)|
| 2:55:12| And what we've done is we've combined those two departments together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| and the proposed budget for 1005-110 is proposed at zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10517)|
| 2:55:23| And so what we've done is we've taken two departments, put them together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10523)|
| 2:55:27| and the total is less than what was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10527)|
| 2:55:31| Did we have those two departments before 2003?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10531)|
| 2:55:37| I'd have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10537)|
| 2:55:40| Well, that's what I'd like to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| It looks to me like we're creating a lot of departments here that other departments had responsibility of before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10541)|
| 2:55:49| What we're doing, what we're proposing in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10549)|
| 2:55:51| is to change from two departments down to one department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10551)|
| 2:55:54| And our proposal changes the number from $600,000 plus to $348,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10554)|
| 2:56:00| So that's a decrease, a substantial decrease, if you take these two departments together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| that were previously reported to one supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10564)|
| 2:56:09| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| But what I'm saying, John, is before we had these two departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| some other department was handling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| We may not have needed the need for these two departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10574)|
| 2:56:20| Commissioner DeBrief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10580)|
| 2:56:23| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10583)|
| 2:56:25| How many full-time regular paid employees do you have in your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10585)|
| 2:56:30| Given we've got nine, and that's not all paid for by Noss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10590)|
| 2:56:39| Some of that is paid solely by the grants that we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10599)|
| 2:56:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10603)|
| 2:56:44| And then how many new positions are you requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10604)|
| 2:56:48| For this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10610)|
| 2:56:54| Yeah, there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10614)|
| 2:56:55| And this wasn't Eric's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| but it was a request of the mayor to have a community development person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10617)|
| 2:57:00| And there is a request for a position, one new, at a salary of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10620)|
| 2:57:06| I saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| Now, why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| Why is that there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| If he's not requesting it, why did the mayor put an individual there for $40,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10629)|
| 2:57:14| It's one of the mayor's priorities to have an outreach person in that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10634)|
| 2:57:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| We also cut community grants this year, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10642)|
| 2:57:27| I think we have a responsible proposal on community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10647)|
| 2:57:33| But it was cut from last year, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| How much of a difference is there in community grants that was allocated last year as opposed to this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| And some of what was included in community grants is now proposed in the contracts budget also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10665)|
| 2:57:53| So it's not just a simple difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10673)|
| 2:57:54| Okay, but I just want to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10674)|
| 2:57:55| what is the difference between what was allocated with community grants last year as it was this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10675)|
| 2:58:00| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10680)|
| 2:58:02| I just want to figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10682)|
| 2:58:04| Okay, because what you're doing, though, is we've got combined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10684)|
| 2:58:06| and we've got some of these agencies that were included in community grants last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10686)|
| 2:58:10| like, for instance, the Development Corporation, and now they're going to be over in the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10690)|
| 2:58:15| And I think it's more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| It's been a method that's been a labeling change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10699)|
| 2:58:23| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10703)|
| 2:58:24| There's been a classification change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10704)|
| 2:58:25| There's been many labeling changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10708)|
| 2:58:29| And how we propose to treat these is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| Let me ask you something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10711)|
| 2:58:32| Mr. Hoagland just now said that a lot of monies go back into the general fund from his department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10712)|
| 2:58:39| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| I think Eric has been very responsible with the county's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10724)|
| 2:58:45| So then if traditionally monies go back into that fund and he's not using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10725)|
| 2:58:50| then why put more than what you expect for him to use in that category?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10730)|
| 2:58:58| Your proposal from the current year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10738)|
| 2:59:00| if you take the community development and community services together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| is over $600,000, and our proposed budget is $348,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10743)|
| 2:59:07| That's a significant decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| And if I could jump in, a lot of that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10750)|
| 2:59:13| I think my salary is pretty much split between Noss County and HUD grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10753)|
| 2:59:18| Now, that's just if we try to charge HUD fairly with our time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10758)|
| 2:59:29| and if I happen to spend 80% of my time working on HUD grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10769)|
| 2:59:35| then that's 30% that the county's not going to have to pick up that HUD will have to pick up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10775)|
| 2:59:42| I won't know that until the end of the year of how much my time was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10782)|
| 2:59:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10787)|
| 2:59:48| Mr. Hoagland, I understand that you didn't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| You apparently were not aware about the new position that the mayor had requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10790)|
| 2:59:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10794)|
| 2:59:55| I should have said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10795)|
| 2:59:56| When I was looking down at mine, I was looking at last year's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10798)|
| 2:59:59| So do you feel that this, I know that the mayor does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10799)|
| 3:00:02| I don't want to put you in a bad position because apparently this is what the mayor wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10802)|
| 3:00:05| But what do you foresee this new position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10805)|
| 3:00:08| How do you foresee this individual enhancing your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10808)|
| 3:00:12| This individual, from my understanding of it, will be enhancing not only mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10812)|
| 3:00:18| but a lot of county departments, a lot of other county departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10818)|
| 3:00:23| But I think the purchasing department has a supplier diversity coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10823)|
| 3:00:28| This position, this liaison, will be kind of doing the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10828)|
| 3:00:33| whereas that coordinator just focuses in on how mainly we let out RFPs or how we get vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10833)|
| 3:00:45| This coordinator is how Noss County, the entire entity of Noss County, can be more diverse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10845)|
| 3:00:54| can reach out to our minority communities, our disadvantaged communities, and that's going to be their charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| So it's not just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10860)|
| 3:01:01| RFPs and vendors for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10861)|
| 3:01:04| For, you know, office supplies to professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10864)|
| 3:01:10| That's what the supplier coordinator does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10870)|
| 3:01:12| So I took it as this is going to be a similar task, but they're going to be looking at two different areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10872)|
| 3:01:21| whereas the one area is just focused in on purchasing as far as vendors of Noss County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| These are going to be, this new position will be those for constituents, for agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10887)|
| 3:01:34| Why is he underneath your department, then, if he's going to be a liaison for all the other departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10894)|
| 3:01:39| Why is he not under the mayor's department or purchasing or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10899)|
| 3:01:43| Well, that's the same question I would ask, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| You know, where we place this, it doesn't matter, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10907)|
| 3:01:51| You could put it under the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10911)|
| 3:01:52| But I think because of Eric's department's work with all the granting agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10912)|
| 3:01:56| I think there would be a reason for that to make sense to be in Eric's area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10916)|
| 3:02:03| and I think it's just a matter of community outreach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10923)|
| 3:02:07| Community outreach to check RFPs and vendors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10927)|
| 3:02:10| No, that's our minority supplier diversity program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10930)|
| 3:02:16| and what Eric is making an analogy to is one minority outreach for specifically for the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10936)|
| 3:02:23| This is going to be a more countywide community outreach for minorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10943)|
| 3:02:29| I still don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10949)|
| 3:02:32| I think it should have stayed in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10952)|
| 3:02:34| Part of these duties are part of what Cynthia Finch had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10954)|
| 3:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| Not totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10959)|
| 3:02:40| And I think it should have been in the mayor's office budget, personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10960)|
| 3:02:47| But I can't tell him how to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10967)|
| 3:02:51| In my opinion, it should have been in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10973)|
| 3:02:54| I'm in agreement with you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10974)|
| 3:02:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10975)|
| 3:02:58| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10978)|
| 3:03:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10983)|
| 3:03:04| John Troyer's question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10984)|
| 3:03:06| I think Commissioner DeFries asked you about money being put back into the general fund that Eric says he turns back over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10986)|
| 3:03:11| if not spent, and I think you didn't answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| You said you think he's very responsible with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10994)|
| 3:03:17| How much money has been the dollar amount, accurate dollar amount, has been put back from last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=10997)|
| 3:03:28| In what area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11008)|
| 3:03:30| In his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11010)|
| 3:03:34| You know, we can make a report on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11014)|
| 3:03:35| I mean, it's published in our annual reports, and we'll be glad to provide that to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11015)|
| 3:03:41| Well, the second question is you said that you're combining two departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| Now, what's the departments again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11025)|
| 3:03:48| Community Development, 1005-105, and then 1005-110, Community Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11028)|
| 3:03:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| Now, can you all just combine departments without doing your flow chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| And we've asked you all to send us another flow chart so we could vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11045)|
| 3:04:09| But I don't think you all have had one since 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11049)|
| 3:04:12| and you all keep coming down here and putting departments together where we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| It's hard enough to do a budget when we just get pieces of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| But when you all start merging departments, do you have the authority to do that in the first thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11060)|
| 3:04:27| I don't want to talk about the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11067)|
| 3:04:29| What I do want to talk about is I think it's a very responsible proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11069)|
| 3:04:33| is what used to be in two departments is now just going to be in one department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| And at a much lower budget, I thought that the commission would be glad to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11079)|
| 3:04:43| and be glad to see a reduction in cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11083)|
| 3:04:45| And that's what is proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11085)|
| 3:04:47| Well, we like to go by the rules while we reduce costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| I mean, that's why we have rules that we have to go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| So are you saying you do not believe that you need to change the flow chart when you combine departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11094)|
| 3:05:00| I understand another flow chart is going to come up for your consideration in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11100)|
| 3:05:06| What I do know, though, is that what our proposal is for the county budget is that we can have a particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11106)|
| 3:05:12| it's actually an organizational chart, and an organizational chart with a box on it that has a zero budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11112)|
| 3:05:19| And I thought the county commission would be glad to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11119)|
| 3:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11121)|
| 3:05:22| I would like for you to get me last year's budget of both the offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11122)|
| 3:05:30| and then give me what is going to be combined this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11130)|
| 3:05:33| A detailed budget, not just a total number, that doesn't help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11133)|
| 3:05:36| And it wouldn't help you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| It's in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11138)|
| 3:05:39| I mean, it's in the book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11139)|
| 3:05:40| One is $229,000, the other is $416,000, the combined budget is $348,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11140)|
| 3:05:44| I just told you that doesn't help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| What does help me is to show the number of employees, what their salary were, where all the money went, construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11146)|
| 3:05:52| Construction funds too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| To see where all of it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11156)|
| 3:05:57| And then we can look and see where, not construction funds, services and other materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11157)|
| 3:06:03| and anything that had to do with those two offices' budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| And then give me the budget for this year that you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11167)|
| 3:06:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11170)|
| 3:06:11| I think you'd be glad to know that you take a $600,000 budget, it's now going to be $348,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11171)|
| 3:06:16| We'll be glad to give you the details on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| And I think it's very, very responsible and we've cut back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| Well, I may be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11181)|
| 3:06:22| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11182)|
| 3:06:24| He's going to get you the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| Do you have any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11186)|
| 3:06:27| Well, I mean, I just think it's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| He's going to get you the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11189)|
| 3:06:31| Is that correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11191)|
| 3:06:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11192)|
| 3:06:34| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11194)|
| 3:06:37| Gentlemen, and John, I'd ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11197)|
| 3:06:42| We've heard hiring freeze, obviously, from whenever the mayor gave his budget report down at Hardin Valley School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11202)|
| 3:06:52| We've heard it several times today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| but it doesn't sound like we've got a hiring freeze going on if we're hiring people for several different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11214)|
| 3:07:02| When I was in the corporate world and we said hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| that meant if someone left the company, if someone left the department, then you didn't get to fill that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11224)|
| 3:07:12| And it sounds like we've actually created positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| And I'm not saying they're not worthy positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11237)|
| 3:07:19| I guess I'm just concerned that it seems like we're hiring people where we want them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11239)|
| 3:07:28| but then the other departments that may actually need someone, there's a hiring freeze for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11248)|
| 3:07:35| I think that's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11255)|
| 3:07:37| I'm glad you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| Yes, there are new positions in the budget, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11259)|
| 3:07:42| Judge Irwin said he had to have a referee to take care of the back load of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11262)|
| 3:07:48| so that when you talk about a custody hearing, that there won't be a five-month wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11268)|
| 3:07:53| And so we provided for a referee for the juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11273)|
| 3:07:56| We provided for clerical support for that referee, and that is proposed in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11276)|
| 3:08:01| But what we are saying is that that position or those positions related to the juvenile court wouldn't be filled until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11281)|
| 3:08:07| So we try to be as responsible as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| Knox County continues to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| We try to meet the needs as well as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| But what we're proposing is from July 1st until December 31st, a six-month window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11294)|
| 3:08:20| Even though there are new positions approved in the budget, which we've provided for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11300)|
| 3:08:24| they wouldn't be filled because we are also counting on savings from the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11304)|
| 3:08:31| And so we've got over $2 million that's in the budget that's counted on as savings from open positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11311)|
| 3:08:36| And so, yes, I think that's a very good question and it's very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| So you're saying that come midyear, if we have not met our income projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11320)|
| 3:08:47| then these proposed positions would not be filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11327)|
| 3:08:50| Would that be a correct assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11330)|
| 3:08:53| I'm glad you brought that up because you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11333)|
| 3:08:56| If our revenue projections start to come in slower than what we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11336)|
| 3:09:00| or if we're even worried, still worried about them at the time, then, yes, the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11340)|
| 3:09:06| the county mayor do have several tools that they can use to manage the budget once the budget year starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11346)|
| 3:09:12| One of those is extending the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11352)|
| 3:09:14| The proposal that's before you now is a six-month hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11354)|
| 3:09:18| That would be July 1st to December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| If revenues are worse than what we expect, we can extend that hiring freeze for another six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11361)|
| 3:09:28| make it the full fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11368)|
| 3:09:30| Another tool that the commission has and the county mayor has, the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11370)|
| 3:09:34| all the elected officials together, can slow down or stop our capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11374)|
| 3:09:40| That's another tool that we can use to manage an economic downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11380)|
| 3:09:44| And there's other pieces where we can slow down spending if we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11384)|
| 3:09:52| and I think that's just something that the county commission can continue to monitor as we go through the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11392)|
| 3:09:57| And if the hiring freeze needs to be extended, we'll certainly recommend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11397)|
| 3:10:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11402)|
| 3:10:03| One other question for Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| Eric, as we heard earlier from the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11405)|
| 3:10:10| some of the grants they get require for people to be on staff to help administer those grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11410)|
| 3:10:18| or help perform the duties of that grant, and then there's a stipulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11418)|
| 3:10:24| The old thing about there's no such thing as a free lunch, there's no such thing as a free grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11424)|
| 3:10:29| Our federal government especially seems to tie a lot of nuances to grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11429)|
| 3:10:35| Is that the case with the grants that you're getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11435)|
| 3:10:38| Are there grants out there that we're going to be required to retain employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11438)|
| 3:10:43| or to have someone on staff that winds up not being paid for by the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11443)|
| 3:10:49| that we ultimately have to pay for as taxpayers in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| Not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| We run a pretty lean staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11454)|
| 3:10:57| Just for those that do work just solely on the HUD grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11457)|
| 3:11:02| we have myself, we have an administrative assistant that's really just kind of half and half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11462)|
| 3:11:08| and then we have three others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| And those other three are solely paid for by the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11471)|
| 3:11:16| In comparison to other entitlement communities across the nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| with those five, with the amount of money that the county gets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11482)|
| 3:11:28| we could easily be at 12 or 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| However, we're at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| Well, I commend you for returning money to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11494)|
| 3:11:37| I think that's awesome, and I'd encourage all departments to do that this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11497)|
| 3:11:42| We try our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11502)|
| 3:11:44| If we don't need it, we don't use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| But we can't, you know, the budget is still just a forecast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11507)|
| 3:11:51| and we try to forecast as best we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11511)|
| 3:11:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11514)|
| 3:11:55| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| Yes, I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| You had, and it might have been Mr. Troyer that made this statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11519)|
| 3:12:03| you said that with regard to the community development grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| that some of those grants have been turned over into contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11526)|
| 3:12:09| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11529)|
| 3:12:10| I'd like a detailed list of what was a grant, which is now a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11530)|
| 3:12:15| and if that has been approved or if that is coming up before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11535)|
| 3:12:19| I'd like a list of all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| And then the other thing that I had a question with regard to, Mr. Hoagland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11541)|
| 3:12:26| I've seen in line item transfers where you have transferred out of your salary budget to cover other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11546)|
| 3:12:32| such as in this past when it went to the senior summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11552)|
| 3:12:36| My question then becomes also to you, Mr. Troyer, is if we have budgeted salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11556)|
| 3:12:42| are we going to be using those as line item transfers to pay for other things during this hiring freeze period time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11562)|
| 3:12:49| And is that going to be justification to pay for other costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11569)|
| 3:12:52| Are you going to be using these budgeted salary dollars that are not going to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11572)|
| 3:12:57| or are you going to be holding them in reserve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11577)|
| 3:13:01| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| I'm glad you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11582)|
| 3:13:04| What our proposal is for is that we have about $2 million that's projected savings on the salary freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11584)|
| 3:13:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11591)|
| 3:13:12| And then as positions are open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11592)|
| 3:13:15| then before they would transfer to any other use is that we would take care of that $2 million first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11595)|
| 3:13:21| And you would see those in the form of line item transfers that take a savings from one department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| and put it back to the projected savings for the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11606)|
| 3:13:31| And that would be before anybody could use salaries for any other purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11611)|
| 3:13:35| And it would obviously have to be approved by the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11615)|
| 3:13:40| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11620)|
| 3:13:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11621)|
| 3:13:42| It seems to me that if in years past that we've obligated or designated amounts in excess of what this department needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11622)|
| 3:13:53| and then you're talking about revenues, and if the revenues are not what we expect them to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11633)|
| 3:13:59| and you were giving us A, B, C of what county commission can do at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| you know, it does say in our charter that any county official who fails to perform the duties required under this division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11645)|
| 3:14:11| or who knowingly, willfully, and intentionally spends or obligates amounts in excess of the appropriations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11651)|
| 3:14:17| or who knowingly, willfully, and intentionally approves expenditures for purposes not authorized by appropriations approved by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11657)|
| 3:14:24| or who knowingly and intentionally overestimate revenues shall be removed from office or terminated from employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11664)|
| 3:14:30| Now, I hope that you were not being, do you really think that there may be an overestimated in revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11670)|
| 3:14:39| No, I'm glad that you asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11679)|
| 3:14:40| I'm glad to be able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11680)|
| 3:14:42| I feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11682)|
| 3:14:43| One, you can look at our property tax numbers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| For our current year property taxes, we've already beat budget, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11686)|
| 3:14:50| So we still have collections for May and June outstanding, but we're already exceeding current year estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11690)|
| 3:14:57| And so when you go budget to budget, it makes the difference look bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11697)|
| 3:15:00| Some people get nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11700)|
| 3:15:03| But I feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11703)|
| 3:15:04| We've been back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11704)|
| 3:15:05| I feel comfortable that we have a reasonable budget and take it as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11705)|
| 3:15:11| You can take any one particular line item by itself, and it might be up, it might be down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11711)|
| 3:15:16| but if you take it as a whole, I feel very, very comfortable with the revenue estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11716)|
| 3:15:20| Well, you know, with this additional $40,000 in this department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11720)|
| 3:15:24| and then in the law director's department there's another $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11724)|
| 3:15:27| and then we had the Judge Irwin wins the referee, and then that referee is going to need clerical support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11727)|
| 3:15:35| I join the others with concern about this during a time of hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11735)|
| 3:15:41| Right, and our proposal is for the new positions not to be filled until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11741)|
| 3:15:45| So, you know, we have to meet the needs of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11745)|
| 3:15:49| and so that's just we meet them halfway through the year instead of at the start of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11749)|
| 3:15:54| But I'm glad you asked that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11754)|
| 3:15:57| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11757)|
| 3:15:59| John, you know the property tax is paid in the rears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11759)|
| 3:16:04| We had a great year last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11764)|
| 3:16:06| That's what we're collecting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11766)|
| 3:16:07| We've got a lot of new houses sitting out here that these builders have not sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11767)|
| 3:16:12| and they're not going to be building any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| Our building permits are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| BZA's fees are down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11778)|
| 3:16:21| Permits, everything is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11781)|
| 3:16:24| It looks like it's headed downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11784)|
| 3:16:26| But I just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11786)|
| 3:16:28| You keep talking about the property taxes, how we're above budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| but that's based on a real good year last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11790)|
| 3:16:35| Now, Eric, I was gone when going to the restroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11795)|
| 3:16:39| when Ms. Davis asked you about these contractual grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11799)|
| 3:16:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11805)|
| 3:16:47| Why were those pulled out and this committee didn't look at them, get to look at those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11807)|
| 3:16:54| Which committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| The committee of citizens, the 58 people that they had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| Who picked those out and said, hey, you can't look at these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11820)|
| 3:17:04| There was a criteria, and I don't know if I have that, if I brought that down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11824)|
| 3:17:08| but there's some things that are detrimental to the county that has to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11828)|
| 3:17:16| The volunteer rescue squad is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11836)|
| 3:17:19| We have to have the volunteer rescue squad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11839)|
| 3:17:22| And I think the other couple are economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11842)|
| 3:17:28| The county does not have an economic development arm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11848)|
| 3:17:33| so we choose to contract those services out instead of having a department within the city county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11853)|
| 3:17:42| So those are the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11862)|
| 3:17:44| I think there was some rescue, not the rescue squad, but volunteer fire departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11864)|
| 3:17:49| kind of those essential services that were the contracted services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| There was a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11872)|
| 3:17:55| I'll be happy to get that to you, that we used as the criteria, which I think would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11875)|
| 3:18:01| I just, you know, off the top of my head, I just don't have it committed to memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11881)|
| 3:18:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11886)|
| 3:18:07| I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11887)|
| 3:18:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11890)|
| 3:18:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11891)|
| 3:18:12| I was looking at the contractual funding that you had listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11892)|
| 3:18:17| Judge Irwin just told us about why he needed the $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11897)|
| 3:18:22| But could you explain to me, with the Catholic Columbus Home for Beds for Juvenile Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11902)|
| 3:18:28| the Catholic Columbus Home is also listed, they requested an additional $75,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11908)|
| 3:18:33| and the proposed budget says $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11913)|
| 3:18:36| So that gives the Catholic Columbus Home $110,000 out of the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11916)|
| 3:18:42| Can you please explain to me why they needed the additional $50,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11922)|
| 3:18:46| From my understanding of that, those are the kids that are in some sort of abusive situation that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11926)|
| 3:18:56| I think the county got out of the foster care business a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11936)|
| 3:19:03| So Catholic Charities has stepped up and they're kind of filling that void for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11943)|
| 3:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11950)|
| 3:19:11| And then can you please explain to me the National Transportation Research Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11951)|
| 3:19:14| they didn't even request anything in the budget, yet underneath contractual funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11954)|
| 3:19:19| it was proposed that they receive $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11959)|
| 3:19:23| Not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11963)|
| 3:19:25| Yeah, this one is a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11965)|
| 3:19:29| It's something that is out near Pellissippi, if you don't know where the facility is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11969)|
| 3:19:35| And we get quite a bit of federal dollars into our community through that agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11975)|
| 3:19:40| and that's the mayor's proposal for our contribution toward that activity for the current year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11980)|
| 3:19:47| And so we make many, many times over that in federal grants that go to that facility each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11987)|
| 3:19:53| So we've never given, they've been such a worthy cause to give $40,000 to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11993)|
| 3:19:59| yet we've never had a history of giving to them before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=11999)|
| 3:20:03| Two years ago they got $50,000 and I think the year before that they got $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12003)|
| 3:20:08| So they skipped a year, but the proposal is to put them back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12008)|
| 3:20:12| We have a grant proposal meeting on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12012)|
| 3:20:17| So if anything dealing with grants, Eric will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12017)|
| 3:20:20| This is funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12020)|
| 3:20:21| See, he said the community grant is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| This is now contractual funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| Well, we can, I think at that particular time we could, we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12025)|
| 3:20:30| We can combine those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12030)|
| 3:20:31| We're going to be able to talk to Eric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12031)|
| 3:20:33| He used to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12033)|
| 3:20:36| Actually, no, I will not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| I've scheduled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12038)|
| 3:20:39| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12039)|
| 3:20:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12040)|
| 3:20:41| So, I mean, we'll have people here to answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| I'd rather talk to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12045)|
| 3:20:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12047)|
| 3:20:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12048)|
| 3:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12049)|
| 3:20:50| And then what about this East Tennessee Development Agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| They, again, did not request any monies, but yet we've allocated $15,000 to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12052)|
| 3:20:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12057)|
| 3:20:58| And that's East Tennessee Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| That's dues toward that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12060)|
| 3:21:03| The first three are dues, the development district, the human resource agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12063)|
| 3:21:06| and the development agency are all different dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12066)|
| 3:21:10| And so that's just what it costs to be a part of those organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| Have we been a part of East Tennessee Development Agency prior to this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12074)|
| 3:21:18| We have, but it hasn't been spelled out in that place in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12078)|
| 3:21:21| and we're just trying to highlight that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| So there's been another change in labeling, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12083)|
| 3:21:27| We're trying to make it easier for you and put it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| This is very complicated when there keeps being changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12089)|
| 3:21:32| It's simple to read, and so we're trying to make it as easy as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12092)|
| 3:21:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12098)|
| 3:21:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12099)|
| 3:21:40| Troyer, this East Tennessee Development Agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| there's no way that they're not related to the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| or the development corporation or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12106)|
| 3:21:48| and we have not funded them in any way in the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| Commissioner Pinkston, I'd have to go back and check the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12114)|
| 3:21:57| Well, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12117)|
| 3:21:58| But we're cutting the development corporation in the chamber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12118)|
| 3:22:01| and giving these people $15,000 that didn't even request it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12121)|
| 3:22:08| That's a proposal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12128)|
| 3:22:10| That does not make good sense to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12130)|
| 3:22:12| because I don't know what the development corporation in the chamber does for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12132)|
| 3:22:16| And this is money we could give to schools or somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12136)|
| 3:22:20| We've cut the development corporation in the chamber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12140)|
| 3:22:22| but yet we're giving somebody $15,000 they didn't even ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12142)|
| 3:22:27| And they're not in any way related to the development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| or the innovation valley or the development corporation in the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12149)|
| 3:22:35| I'd like to get you more information on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| and I couldn't share with you exactly what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12157)|
| 3:22:40| So I'd be glad to share that with everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12160)|
| 3:22:42| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12162)|
| 3:22:44| I just want to echo what Commissioner Pinkston said about the East Tennessee Development Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12164)|
| 3:22:51| First off, I don't even know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12171)|
| 3:22:55| But to send something outside the county when our development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12175)|
| 3:23:01| and our innovation valley has been hit like it has concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12181)|
| 3:23:05| And, Commissioner Pinkston, I agree with you in your remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12185)|
| 3:23:09| You too, Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12189)|
| 3:23:11| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| John, you just said something that struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12195)|
| 3:23:21| Our community grants last year totaled $3.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12209)|
| 3:23:32| And you said you pulled some of the things out of community grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12212)|
| 3:23:38| and you reclassified them under contractual funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12218)|
| 3:23:43| Is that not what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12223)|
| 3:23:44| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12224)|
| 3:23:46| So we've not really reduced what we've done in the past, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12226)|
| 3:23:53| Because we've just moved it from community grants total to contractual obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12233)|
| 3:24:00| We haven't reduced it as much as it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12240)|
| 3:24:03| So how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12243)|
| 3:24:06| Yeah, I think you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12246)|
| 3:24:08| What your question is, is that, yeah, you should take these together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12248)|
| 3:24:11| If you're looking at the small book, it's page 29 and page 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| and you should consider both groups together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12254)|
| 3:24:17| And I think that's a better assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| Well, you've got 1.9 plus the 2, that's 3.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12259)|
| 3:24:24| And I don't know if you moved what we spent last year along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12264)|
| 3:24:29| I mean, did we have a contractual funding last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12269)|
| 3:24:33| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12273)|
| 3:24:34| It was a smaller list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12274)|
| 3:24:35| It was a smaller list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12275)|
| 3:24:36| So, I mean, trying to compare the two now is a little bit more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12276)|
| 3:24:40| Do we know how those two compared last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12280)|
| 3:24:43| Yeah, I think the numbers are 3.1 million for the grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12283)|
| 3:24:46| and 1.6 million for contracted services or contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12286)|
| 3:24:50| and that's a total of about 4.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12290)|
| 3:24:53| And then the current year is 2 million for grants and 1.9 million for. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12293)|
| 3:24:58| Well, we've gone up close to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| 3.9, right, 3.9 versus 4.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| So it's a decrease, a decrease of about $750,000, just doing math in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| And so it is a decrease, but it's not as much as you would expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12307)|
| 3:25:12| If you just looked at the grants, that would be a decrease of 1.1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| but it's not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12319)|
| 3:25:26| That's kind of the question I had because I was just taking that 1.9 to 3.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12326)|
| 3:25:36| But I see here where we had both of them last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12336)|
| 3:25:45| But looking at it, just at the bottom one, other county contracts, $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12345)|
| 3:25:51| What is. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| That is not identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12353)|
| 3:25:54| And what we put that money in there for is for the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12354)|
| 3:25:58| if there were a priority that we missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12358)|
| 3:26:00| or that was different than what we have proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| then we have $50,000 there for the county commission to identify those priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12365)|
| 3:26:11| in case we missed one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| Do you have in there the discretionary $5,000 or. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12373)|
| 3:26:17| $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12378)|
| 3:26:21| See, these are the things that become problems when we just approve something for other grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12381)|
| 3:26:29| because someone gets to spend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12389)|
| 3:26:32| and then it gets moved around to a food budget or wherever it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12392)|
| 3:26:36| and we say, well, it's already approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12396)|
| 3:26:40| So wouldn't it be better just to hold things like that off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12400)|
| 3:26:43| and if we need it we come back and approve them at a later date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12403)|
| 3:26:47| I mean, you could put that money toward the law director's legal fees if you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12407)|
| 3:26:52| Or we could just put it back in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| Or we could put it back in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12414)|
| 3:26:56| That would be fine too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12416)|
| 3:26:58| That was just trying to anticipate that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| we can make one list of the agencies and the contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12421)|
| 3:27:06| and if there's any of them that we missed that the county commission felt were a priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12426)|
| 3:27:10| then this would be an opportunity for them to take care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12430)|
| 3:27:14| or we can just not spend the money, and that would be for the county commission to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12434)|
| 3:27:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12439)|
| 3:27:20| Do we have any other that we've talked about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12440)|
| 3:27:24| anything in the budget that's not identified as spent going to somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12444)|
| 3:27:30| not just other contracts or other agencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| I mean, how much total money do we have just sitting in a budget, not appropriated really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12453)|
| 3:27:38| It's appropriated, but not appropriated for a purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12458)|
| 3:27:42| And we've got, you know, the $6,000 that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12462)|
| 3:27:45| That's $114,000 plus the $50,000, and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12465)|
| 3:27:51| I mean, it's a very, very tight budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12471)|
| 3:27:54| And it's just my opinion that we're better off limiting the number of times that we go back to the county fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12474)|
| 3:28:01| during the year, and so that was also one of my intents is to try to not have to go back if we had to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12481)|
| 3:28:09| Now, the county commission can choose to spend it in a different way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12489)|
| 3:28:12| and that's why we put it there is for the county commission to make its priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12492)|
| 3:28:16| Well, how come sometimes we want to put more in than we need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12496)|
| 3:28:18| and then others we know we may need more in the law director's office, but you say we can come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12498)|
| 3:28:23| So what tips the scale when something needs to come back and we need to watch how we spend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12503)|
| 3:28:30| or we over put something in a budget that may or may not be spent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12510)|
| 3:28:35| Where does it tip the scale for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| Okay, for me, the distinction to be made is I think in the terms of the lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12517)|
| 3:28:42| one, I think it's very, very important for the county commission to be very well in tune with the progress of the lawsuits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12522)|
| 3:28:48| and the amount of lawsuits that we have against the county and the amount of legal fees from outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12528)|
| 3:28:54| and I think that's something that the county commission needs to pay very, very close attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| and that is exactly why I wanted to budget in that manner is I feel like this is the best way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12539)|
| 3:29:04| to get the law director back up here and talk about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12544)|
| 3:29:08| For a grant, once the budget is approved, they go through the documentation process with Eric's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12548)|
| 3:29:17| and it's just spent, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| But the lawsuits are different in my mind because they're ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12559)|
| 3:29:23| and at some point in time the county needs to be able to make a cost-benefit analysis to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12563)|
| 3:29:29| okay, how much is this worth to fight this particular lawsuit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12569)|
| 3:29:33| And I think we need to go through that, and I think maybe at some point we'll say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12573)|
| 3:29:37| we're not going to spend any more on this lawsuit, and I think you'll see that in more than one occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12577)|
| 3:29:43| Well, the problem is when someone sues Knox County, we have no control over that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12583)|
| 3:29:48| and the law director is going to have to go out and defend it, and you're going to have numerous lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12588)|
| 3:29:55| We already know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12595)|
| 3:29:56| I mean, when we've got one attorney that loves just to file them, they may make sense or make no sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12596)|
| 3:30:01| but someone has to go defend it, and we know that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12601)|
| 3:30:07| Through past years, we know what we have to pay out usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12607)|
| 3:30:11| So to make the law director come back mid-year and say, hey, we've spent this $350,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12611)|
| 3:30:18| if we know that's going to happen, why would we even do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12618)|
| 3:30:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12622)|
| 3:30:23| I think it's a very important one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| I think that helps make the case for an additional staff person in a law director's office because of the volume of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12625)|
| 3:30:30| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12630)|
| 3:30:31| They've got a volume of business and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| I also understand that the incoming law director is going to have more of an inclination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12633)|
| 3:30:40| toward keeping defense in-house as many times as he can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12640)|
| 3:30:44| and I think it's also important for the county commission to know the status of these lawsuits as they go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12644)|
| 3:30:50| and if there's an opportunity to say we want to stop or not go further, we can save the county some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12650)|
| 3:30:56| and there may be opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| Well, I think those decisions should be left up to the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12660)|
| 3:31:03| because there's going to be some instances where if he didn't defend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12663)|
| 3:31:07| it would cost the county money down the road for something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12667)|
| 3:31:11| And that's why I feel like the law director should come make a report to the county commission for just those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12671)|
| 3:31:17| We're 15 minutes into our lunch period, and we're going to do at least one more for Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12677)|
| 3:31:23| Eric, on this grant funding, how are you releasing this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12683)|
| 3:31:28| All at one time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12688)|
| 3:31:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12690)|
| 3:31:31| You all just passed a resolution, so anything that has community grants will be tied to that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12691)|
| 3:31:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12697)|
| 3:31:38| Now, are you following the procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12698)|
| 3:31:39| They've never been followed since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12699)|
| 3:31:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12701)|
| 3:31:42| We put a procedure in in 2004 that the people are to come up here, you release that money quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12702)|
| 3:31:48| they're to give us a report on what they've done with it and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12708)|
| 3:31:51| and they're supposed to come for this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12711)|
| 3:31:53| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12713)|
| 3:31:55| I believe it was on by the end of March is when they come before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12715)|
| 3:32:01| But what we did is we merged the resolution that just allows them to come forward in March to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12721)|
| 3:32:09| What we're going to do is take it a step further and say every quarter our office will be down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12729)|
| 3:32:15| and we're going to let you know who's meeting their goals, who's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12735)|
| 3:32:21| Sometimes agencies just say, you know, plans fell through here, we don't want this money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12741)|
| 3:32:26| You'll get all that on a quarterly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12746)|
| 3:32:28| I don't believe anybody here saw these people in March, did they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12748)|
| 3:32:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12752)|
| 3:32:33| And, you know, they're supposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12753)|
| 3:32:34| I want you to remember this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12754)|
| 3:32:36| It's quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12756)|
| 3:32:37| They're supposed to tell us what their CEO makes, if they're paid, and the next highest paid employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12757)|
| 3:32:44| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12764)|
| 3:32:46| We got that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12766)|
| 3:32:47| I know you've had it, but you've never abided by it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12767)|
| 3:32:50| And I'm going to see that it's done this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12770)|
| 3:32:53| We have it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12773)|
| 3:32:54| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12774)|
| 3:32:55| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12775)|
| 3:32:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12776)|
| 3:32:57| I just wanted to comment on that $50,000 that was allocated as other county contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12777)|
| 3:33:02| that was just sort of an ambiguous agency and just kind of tucked away in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12782)|
| 3:33:08| And I agree totally with Commissioner Moore that that should not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12788)|
| 3:33:11| And, again, I'm going to reference Section 2 in our county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12791)|
| 3:33:14| It says any county official or officer who obligates amounts in excess of the appropriations shall be removed from office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12794)|
| 3:33:24| And, again, this is very, to me, this is just not minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12804)|
| 3:33:27| I just don't understand why you would tuck money in there when other agencies have come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12807)|
| 3:33:32| or other departments have come up and actually requested more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12812)|
| 3:33:36| And you say, well, let them come to county commission at that designated time and throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12816)|
| 3:33:42| Yet here there's $50,000 tucked in here just in case we might need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12822)|
| 3:33:46| And I think Commissioner Moore hit it on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12826)|
| 3:33:49| This is from the audit hearings that we heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12829)|
| 3:33:52| This is the kind of thing that created a lot of the loopholes for the audit hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12832)|
| 3:34:00| And so I don't think this needs to be in here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12840)|
| 3:34:02| And I totally agree with Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12842)|
| 3:34:04| And I just find this quite alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12844)|
| 3:34:06| Commissioner DeFries, that money has been in there every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12846)|
| 3:34:09| That's money when we have the grants on the 11th and we need to tweak it a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12849)|
| 3:34:15| That's what that money is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| It's in there every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12859)|
| 3:34:20| I mean, it's for us to tweak if we need to do a little bit more for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12860)|
| 3:34:24| But that money is there for us to do that on the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12864)|
| 3:34:30| I don't know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12870)|
| 3:34:31| Okay, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12871)|
| 3:34:32| It's in there every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12872)|
| 3:34:33| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12873)|
| 3:34:34| But, again, I think that's something that we need to be very careful of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12874)|
| 3:34:37| But it's going to be our money to add a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12877)|
| 3:34:42| do whatever we want to do with it before the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12882)|
| 3:34:47| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12887)|
| 3:34:50| Bruce, I'm going to try to get you in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12890)|
| 3:35:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12900)|
| 3:35:01| I'm Bruce Weitrick, Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| I'll try to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12903)|
| 3:35:07| Commissioner Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12907)|
| 3:35:10| Bruce, does your budget have anything in there on the Tedford Road situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12910)|
| 3:35:17| and contingencies based upon what might happen out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12917)|
| 3:35:21| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12921)|
| 3:35:22| Initially, when the Tedford Road problem came up, we came before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12922)|
| 3:35:27| got an appropriation of $300,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12927)|
| 3:35:31| Currently, we probably have, I'm going to say, maybe $8,000 or $9,000 left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12931)|
| 3:35:36| in that $300,000 contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12936)|
| 3:35:38| I haven't come back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12938)|
| 3:35:40| I did not include that in my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12940)|
| 3:35:42| I'll have to come back to commission if we need to do anything else outside of Tedford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12942)|
| 3:35:46| Do you foresee us collecting any money this year back on what we've already had to spend out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12946)|
| 3:35:51| since that wasn't our land and obviously wasn't our fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12951)|
| 3:35:55| That's probably a question better left to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12955)|
| 3:35:58| I personally did not, don't think that that's going to be a real possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12958)|
| 3:36:01| that we're going to recoup all our money out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| But that's probably something better answered by the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| Thank you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12966)|
| 3:36:08| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12968)|
| 3:36:10| Yes, Bruce, you're in charge of the fleet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12970)|
| 3:36:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12972)|
| 3:36:13| I know that a few years ago there was an issue with people who were assigned vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12973)|
| 3:36:16| not taking proper care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| Are we making sure that the oil is being changed properly, that the tires are being rotated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12978)|
| 3:36:22| just good maintenance on our vehicles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12982)|
| 3:36:24| Certainly, all the offices under the mayor's office and all the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12984)|
| 3:36:30| we have a system that tracks their oil changes and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12990)|
| 3:36:34| Certainly, the mayor obviously has control over his fleet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12994)|
| 3:36:38| and we contact those individuals and tell them if they're overdoing an oil change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=12998)|
| 3:36:42| or any other kind of servicing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13002)|
| 3:36:44| As regards to the other departments, that's somewhat of a separate matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13004)|
| 3:36:48| I believe we still contact them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13008)|
| 3:36:50| but we don't have the authority to make them bring their vehicles in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13010)|
| 3:36:53| When we look at replacing vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| I know that what policies do we have to look at, like, more fuel efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13015)|
| 3:37:02| maybe not a lot of the perks on the vehicle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13022)|
| 3:37:05| those kinds of things to make sure that we're getting a good vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13025)|
| 3:37:08| but we're not being lavish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13028)|
| 3:37:10| A couple things that we do as far as vehicle replacement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13030)|
| 3:37:12| and what we try to do is we look at the worst vehicle we have in the fleet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13032)|
| 3:37:16| and try to oftentimes that vehicle may have 200,000 miles on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13036)|
| 3:37:19| and we will actually pass these vehicles down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| and even transfer them to a different department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| For instance, we utilize a lot of vehicles in engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13043)|
| 3:37:27| that have quite a few miles on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| My building inspection office, however,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| we typically like to transfer those vehicles when they get around 100,000 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13051)|
| 3:37:35| because those are scheduled appointments that they have to go out and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13055)|
| 3:37:39| and we want to have a reliable vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13059)|
| 3:37:41| For other departments, it's not as critical, so we do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| As far as fuel efficiency and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13065)|
| 3:37:48| that's really done on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| Unfortunately, a lot of my departments have to utilize four-wheel drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13070)|
| 3:37:53| because doing inspections on construction sites, things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13073)|
| 3:37:57| and by nature of the business that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| we have to utilize a lot of pickup trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| So consequently, although we can look at fuel economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13081)|
| 3:38:04| unfortunately those vehicles are the least fuel efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13084)|
| 3:38:07| As far as types of vehicles we buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| we try as much as possible to buy off what's referred to as the state bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13089)|
| 3:38:14| the state contract, where we get a real value for our dollar in purchasing vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13094)|
| 3:38:20| How many vehicles do we have in the fleet now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13100)|
| 3:38:25| 1,340.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13109)|
| 3:38:32| Yes. I'm looking at page 240 of the online budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13112)|
| 3:38:36| $800 in food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13116)|
| 3:38:38| I know it's lunchtime, but that's a new item in your budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13118)|
| 3:38:42| The only food that we really purchase in Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13122)|
| 3:38:45| is either for in-service training where we have employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13125)|
| 3:38:49| that are going to be essentially being on site all day for training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13129)|
| 3:38:53| We may order pizza out or lunch box or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13133)|
| 3:38:57| As far as if you're concerned about employees eating at restaurants or things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| that never happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13141)|
| 3:39:02| That's strictly for meetings that we might have that we have volunteers come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13142)|
| 3:39:06| things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13146)|
| 3:39:07| Certainly it's not for me or any of my staff to go to any restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13147)|
| 3:39:11| Okay. The $6,000 increase in communications and IT in your department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13151)|
| 3:39:15| That more likely is the attrition on our radios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13155)|
| 3:39:19| replacement of communication equipment that essentially just gets worn out and has to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13159)|
| 3:39:25| And a $10,000 increase in vehicles, specifically in stormwater management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13165)|
| 3:39:29| We are adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13169)|
| 3:39:30| There are two positions that are being added in that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13170)|
| 3:39:34| However, that is to replace a vehicle, which I think has about 175,000 miles on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13174)|
| 3:39:39| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13179)|
| 3:39:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13180)|
| 3:39:41| Commissioner Lucco?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13183)|
| 3:39:44| Bruce, you just alluded to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13184)|
| 3:39:47| The two new positions with the new stormwater ordinance that we have, have we filled those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13187)|
| 3:39:52| No, sir. That falls right in with the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13192)|
| 3:39:56| They will not be filled until January 1st, provided budget predictions hold true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13196)|
| 3:40:01| So how are we going to enforce this new ordinance if we don't have the inspectors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13201)|
| 3:40:07| Well, Commissioner, actually these are support personnel for the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| Quite frankly, we're going to do the best we can with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13212)|
| 3:40:16| But actually one position is actually an in-house person to do clerical work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13216)|
| 3:40:22| There's a tremendous amount of paperwork that's tied to this NPDES permit that we have to comply with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13222)|
| 3:40:27| We're currently utilizing other staffers in our office to try to keep up with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13227)|
| 3:40:33| The other person is going to be a KGIS person for mapping purposes also in order to keep up with the NPDES permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13233)|
| 3:40:41| Is that going to require some comp time and some overtime pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13241)|
| 3:40:46| Actually, it could very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| It could require some comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13248)|
| 3:40:51| However, the situation with the KGIS person, currently we're working with a contract right now that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13251)|
| 3:40:58| will be able to carry that through until the hiring freeze is lifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13258)|
| 3:41:03| As far as the in-house clerical, we're still just dividing up those resources amongst my existing employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13263)|
| 3:41:10| Innovation Drive in Dutchtown, where are we on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13270)|
| 3:41:15| We met with the cannon and cannon who is doing the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13275)|
| 3:41:19| They've actually come up with two proposals for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13279)|
| 3:41:23| They're detailed enough that they show us on the map they have not come up with the cost estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13283)|
| 3:41:28| We feel like one of them is, when we say short term, we're thinking it can address the needs for the next three, four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13288)|
| 3:41:33| or five years, and we anticipate implementing that in this next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13293)|
| 3:41:38| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13298)|
| 3:41:41| Bruce, looking at your just total budget, it looks like you're down about, you're reducing your budget about $60,000 overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13301)|
| 3:41:49| Yes, sir, I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| You've lost three code enforcement officers, but you're getting replaced, I guess, back in there with two stormwater employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13311)|
| 3:42:00| With the stormwater management since 2007 to this year is up about $700,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13320)|
| 3:42:12| I believe that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13332)|
| 3:42:14| And your overall budget is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13334)|
| 3:42:17| With the increase in fuel, with the increase of asphalt, how would that be possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13337)|
| 3:42:27| Typically the area that would suffer in our budget is it comes down to asphalt paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13347)|
| 3:42:32| We generally spend about $3 to $3.5 million in resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| When my budget has to be reduced or cut back, typically that is the area that's targeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13356)|
| 3:42:41| And that's my next question is because that's where we hear the most concerns from citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13361)|
| 3:42:47| Like I said earlier, your schools, your law enforcement, and your roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13367)|
| 3:42:51| And over the past couple of years, we've basically cut our road paving in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13371)|
| 3:42:57| The dollar amount stays the same, but it costs so much more to do the paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13377)|
| 3:43:02| And this year we're like at 47 miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13382)|
| 3:43:07| You know, we're going to be so far behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13387)|
| 3:43:11| We need to pump this budget up to get some more miles done in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| because if we go out to 08 and then 09 and then 2010 and we'll all be gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13395)|
| 3:43:23| we're going to be 150, 200 miles behind basically from what we've done in 2004 and 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13403)|
| 3:43:33| And if you talk about 125 miles of road, I guess it's like $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13413)|
| 3:43:42| Based on current dollars, that's about correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13422)|
| 3:43:46| So, I mean, I think we ought to look at putting another $3.5 million in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13426)|
| 3:43:55| so at least we could do almost 100 miles of road this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13435)|
| 3:44:00| Well, I'm certainly not going to argue with anyone who wants to put money in my budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13440)|
| 3:44:03| but at the same time I don't want to be lynched out in front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13443)|
| 3:44:05| when they take it from the Sheriff's Department or somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13445)|
| 3:44:09| Well, like I said earlier, schools, law enforcement, and roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13449)|
| 3:44:13| and I don't care what kind of survey I send out, that's how it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13453)|
| 3:44:16| A lot of stuff in here is great if we can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13456)|
| 3:44:21| But I think the people who pay taxes really want decent roads to drive on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13461)|
| 3:44:26| Well, certainly, and you brought up, Storm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13466)|
| 3:44:28| I think that you want to keep in mind that there has been a tremendous amount of increase in stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13468)|
| 3:44:32| and quite frankly it's almost mandated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13472)|
| 3:44:35| In order for the county to maintain our compliance with our NPDES permit, there's no way around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13475)|
| 3:44:41| Well, I know it looks like stormwater ordinances and stormwater management is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13481)|
| 3:44:45| and we ought to be doing it, but we shouldn't let something else suffer because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13485)|
| 3:44:51| So, Mr. Troyer, is it the administration's thought that 47 miles of road in Knox County is sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13491)|
| 3:45:00| We'd like to do more, but I don't want to push up our revenue estimates anymore, and we can only spend what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13500)|
| 3:45:07| Well, if you're talking about a $600-and-whatever-million budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13507)|
| 3:45:12| we can't find $3.5 million to double what we're doing in road paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13512)|
| 3:45:19| I think you have a proposal that's responsible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13519)|
| 3:45:22| and I'm just wondering where you would get the $3.5 million from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13522)|
| 3:45:26| Maybe by budget time I'll have a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13526)|
| 3:45:29| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13531)|
| 3:45:32| It sort of is led into by what Commissioner Moore just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13532)|
| 3:45:36| and I'm also looking at the capital improvement plan for the engineering public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13536)|
| 3:45:41| Is the paving, that comes under your yearly operating budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13541)|
| 3:45:44| and when we're talking about capital improvements on the highways, that's a different budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13544)|
| 3:45:50| That's coming from different monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13552)|
| 3:45:58| Are you finished, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13558)|
| 3:46:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13560)|
| 3:46:01| Thank you, Bruce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13561)|
| 3:46:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13562)|
| 3:46:03| We're going to take an hour and three minutes for lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13563)|
| 3:46:07| We'll be back at 1.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| We'll come back with Martha Phillips and follow the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080602budgethearingspart1?start=13569)|
