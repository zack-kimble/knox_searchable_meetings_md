| 0:02:59| For the Mayor's report, I just want to mention we have some events coming up this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| and next to mark the 4th of July holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| Our festival and the 4th celebration actually kicks off on June 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| that's this Thursday, with the Patriotic Bike Parade downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| This has become a really popular event the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| There will be a best decorated bike contest with four categories, business, family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| children ages 7 to 12, and children 6 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| But there's no council category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| We'll have to check into that for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| You sign in or register starting at 5.30 p.m. on Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| and the parade will begin at 6.30 p.m. on Union Avenue at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=220)|
| 0:03:45| Proceed up Gay Street to Magnolia and then back down Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| So I encourage everyone to come out for the Patriotic Bike Parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=229)|
| 0:03:52| That's this Thursday, June 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| 5.30 registration, 6.30 the parade begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| And, of course, our festival on the 4th itself will take place next Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| July 4th at World's Fair Park starting at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| There will be a Regal Kids Zone with free family activities along with food vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| music from The Coveralls and Brad Blackwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| and at 5.45 p.m. a repeat of last year's tug-of-war contest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| between the police department and the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| Now, I understand the police department won the tug-of-war pretty decisively last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| and I imagine that the fire department has been practicing for the rematch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| We'll see. We'll see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| Then at 8 p.m. the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra will begin their annual patriotic concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=280)|
| 0:04:47| and it will conclude with the fireworks starting at 9.35 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| So I'd like to remind everyone that this is a rain or shine event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=291)|
| 0:04:55| and those of you who were there last year can vouch for that, if you recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| But hopefully that won't be a concern this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| So I also need to recognize the sponsors who make this huge celebration possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| That's thanks to Pilot Flying J, Regal, the Knoxville New Sentinel, WBIR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| R102.1, HOT104.5, 93.1 WNOX, Earth Fare, Home Depot, and Cheerwine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=314)|
| 0:05:24| We appreciate all of those sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Also next week we have another event in our series celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=327)|
| 0:05:35| Wednesday, July 2nd, is actually the anniversary date of the signing of that bill by President Lyndon Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=335)|
| 0:05:42| And to commemorate that, we have some very special guests who are coming to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Rabbi Israel Drezner and Dori Ladner were civil rights activists who worked and marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| throughout the 1960s, working for civil rights and desegregation across the South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| Rabbi Drezner was once called the most arrested rabbi in America for his many acts of civil disobedience for that cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=361)|
| 0:06:10| We are honored that both of them will be here next Wednesday to participate in a commemorative march and celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| The march will begin at 6 p.m. outside the safety building on Howard Baker, Jr. Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| and proceed to Mount Olive Baptist Church, which is at 1601 Dandridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| At 7 p.m., Rabbi Drezner and Ms. Ladner will both speak at a celebration at Mount Olive Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| This has really been a great series of events organized by our Title VI coordinator, Jocelyn Hundley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| and we have had major civil rights figures come to town to help us remember and celebrate the history of the civil rights movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| that led to the creation and the passage of the Civil Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| As you all know, I'm sure you all share this, it's a very important part of our history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| and it's very fitting that this event is so close to Independence Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=417)|
| 0:07:02| So that's next Wednesday, the 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| So if you have any more questions about any of those things, it will be up on our website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=425)|
| 0:07:09| or you can always call 311 and they will give you the latest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=429)|
| 0:07:12| So that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| Are there any reports from Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=438)|

| 0:07:28| Chris Canada is in The Coveralls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| I think he's the lead singer, or one of them, and his son is Hugo Canada, who has a kidney tumor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=450)|
| 0:07:37| and there's a big community support behind him, so that's why we're standing up in the Go Hugo support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| So thank you all for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you for bringing that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=466)|

| 0:08:05| Also, Captain Holliday did attend that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=485)|

| 0:08:19| and we discussed some various action plans that we might do in various cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| and I'll have more information on that as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=504)|

| 0:16:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Bob, I left you a voicemail to this effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| It not only concerns this particular issue, but several others, and we've seen it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| the last several months, in these projects where we have a budget, and then we keep seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| change orders that generally increase the price of whatever part of that budget it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| I guess my question is, are we still within our overall budget, and the change orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| also suggest to me that maybe there may be some, I'm not accusing anybody of anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| I'm just curious about bidding low and then coming back later with an increase to whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| so if you could address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Good questions, and I tell you, we're going to let Ann Wallace come and answer those tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| Ann and I have talked about responses to these Cumberland questions, so she's going to handle those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Good evening, Mayor and members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Ann Wallace, City of Knoxville, Office of Redevelopment, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Councilman, in answer to your question, first and foremost, for the Cumberland Avenue Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1037)|
| 0:17:22| I am pleased to let you know that we are still within the overall budget that we have anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| It's approximately $17 million, and these change orders do fall within that initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1047)|
| 0:17:32| scope or that overall budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| In terms of the bidding process, if I may, we go out for requests for professional services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| especially with TDOT contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| We are required to follow TDOT's rules for engaging professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1065)|
| 0:17:51| We have a competitive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| That process does not include estimated costs of services at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| It's a request for qualifications, whoever is most qualified to respond to that proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| Specific to the Cumberland Avenue Corridor Project and the change orders that you're seeing now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| this project has, I think in fairness, exceeded the timeline that any of us would have expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1088)|
| 0:18:15| And we have used that to our full advantage to make sure that we are communicating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| and updating our stakeholders regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| And so while we would prefer not to see change orders, we certainly see a reasonable background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| and substantiation for why we're having these change orders come forward tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1111)|
| 0:18:38| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| David Harrell is here as well with Vaughn and Melvin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| If anybody wants to ask a question specific to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| No, the question wasn't specific to this contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| We've seen so many of these, it just brings the question to my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| If David would like to address it, that would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| I think on the bigger question, I think Ann explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| these things are selected through professional services contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and then the pricing is attached by the hour as we estimate the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| But how to change, when you have a change order, what might instigate a change order?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| Well, specific to the Cumberland Project, using it as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| we ended up having a significantly longer time period for environmental clearance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| which is a required phase by TDOT's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| We also experienced a significantly longer right-of-way phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| which you all have been very engaged in as we have dealt with property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| and had to get temporary construction easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| and long-term permanent drainage utility easements or utility easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| And so just the nature of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| and I would say that in general the nature of federally funded projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| tends to be very intensive and requires a lot of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| And obviously we're working with both our partners at the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| and also FHWA to move these projects forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| So unfortunately it takes time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| and sometimes you can't estimate exactly how much time it will take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Councilman Dahlvoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Before you leave, let me just ask one similar question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| The next one I think is actually the more interesting contract to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| But in this one, in this particular contract with Vaughn and Melton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| direct field labor is $107,000 under the original estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| and there's almost $200,000 in overhead, both field and home office overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| And it strikes me that seems out of line in terms of the kind of cost attributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| Now, I don't know what's in that category or how it's composed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| so maybe it's explained away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| It's a separate fixed fee or profit of 12%, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| But the field labor was $107,000 or call it $108,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| There's some home office labor of about $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| And then there's field office overhead of $138,000 and home office overhead of $61,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| Sounds like someone's dumping the entire cost of running the business on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| And I know that's unfair, but the numbers look out of line to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| and I'm just wondering what the explanation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| If I may, Councilmember, a large portion of CEI contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| are simply reporting back to the state and managing that paper trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| so that when the state or our project gets audited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| we can provide a full account for all the materials testing that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| But in specifics to those details, I would like to ask David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| Is that all overhead, that thing you're describing right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| Well, I'd like to ask David to come in and address those specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| David Harrell, Regional Vice President with Vaughan and Melton, 1909 Ayler Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| The overhead rates that you're referencing have to do with accepted overhead rates that TDOT approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1307)|
| 0:21:57| Every year our company, as well as all other consulting engineering firms, go through audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1317)|
| 0:22:02| And those audits reveal the cost of doing business for any consulting firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| So they're actual verified overhead based on the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| It just seemed high to me. It seemed out of proportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| I wouldn't have been surprised if the field labor and the home office labor was X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| and then this would be one and a half times X would make the whole total package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| But it seems to be double the cost of the labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| And, quite frankly, our field overhead rate, which is somewhere, I think, around 125%, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1350)|
| 0:22:37| Yes, that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| And then the office overhead rate is about 154%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1358)|
| 0:22:41| 156%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| And, again, those are audited by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Audited rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| Thank you, Mr. Harrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Here, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| Councilman Wallace is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1372)|
| 0:22:58| Todd talked about it earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| And, I mean, you said on this first one that because of the delay that we had, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| that we've got no one to bid and you've gone back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| that this actually was going to take an extra inspector on the site for an additional two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| I mean, there's really hard cost here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| It's an indirect result because we weren't able to get a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| And then you've put together efforts to you've got to get people to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| And you're working hard on that and trying to get adding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| You've got to make it where people want to bid on this thing and trying to secure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| And the change to the timeline from six months to eight months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| that's about a 33% increase in overall time for the Phase I contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| And you can see the cost estimate for the change order is approximately 20% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| So while we are seeing some additional cost there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| the benefit that we see to this is that we're going to be moving to a season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| that will not negatively impact the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| The football season will be after University Commons opens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| which we've all worked very hard to see that be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| So, yes, we heard from our contractors when we went back after we didn't receive bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1447)|
| 0:24:12| and they said very clearly six months for this type of work is going to be a very big challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| especially with all of that other scheduling issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| So this is an opportunity to make sure that we get good qualified contractors bidding on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| And that's one of the reasons you've pushed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| And I think that's a very valid reason, and I appreciate your response on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| Yes, I wanted to ask a question about the subcontractors and the minority business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Major contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Are they planning to use any minority subcontractors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| As a state contract, as a local programs contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| we have what we call a DBE goal or a disadvantaged business enterprise goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| and I believe that that goal has been set in coordination with TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| I'm going to turn to my consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| I believe we're at 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| I believe we're at 10 percent of the overall contract must be awarded to a disadvantaged business enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| and we would love to see more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| So if you know folks who are interested in this type of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| please make sure they're aware of the bid, which we hope will go out in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Any other questions, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Item C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute change order number five to contract number C090105| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| between the City of Knoxville and Vaughan & Melton Consulting Engineers, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| to increase the contract price by $138,475 for a new contract total of $2,292,330| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1550)|
| 0:25:59| for completion of the Cumberland Avenue Streetscapes Improvement Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| I was saving this one, I guess, for Ann or Mr. Harrell, but this is the fifth change order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| and I realize there's a lot of jockeying between utilities and phone companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1575)|
| 0:26:22| and everything else to try to coordinate this, and obviously it's a difficult task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| Do you think we're at the end of the change orders in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| I mean, five is quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| I would honestly say that, yes, I would hope that we are at the end of our change orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| Again, with bidding in September, the project will move from the design phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| to the construction phase and the construction engineering inspection services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| So I think we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1615)|
| 0:26:56| Did we get a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1621)|

| 0:27:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Ann or Bob, why don't you talk about how we were able to work by working with KUB to really get this price reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| so council can appreciate what y'all went through with KUB too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| Well, yeah, we've had a great partnership with KUB on this project, and there's been a lot of really good thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| I know some of you all will remember that we held a meeting, I believe it was in the fall of 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| to look at what utility options there were to remove the overhead lines off of Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| and we went through options as expensive as almost $5 million to bury all the utilities underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1700)|
| 0:28:27| With the advent of the new substation at Dale Avenue and 17th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| we were actually able to take advantage of that new substation and look at rerouting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| instead of having to run parallel down Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| The transmission line will actually only cross Cumberland at 18th Street underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1721)|
| 0:28:47| and then the rest of the overhead services to the building will be off the alleys on the north and south side of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| So we were able to significantly reduce our costs from what could have been as much as $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| down to the $750 million that's included in this contract, and we're very pleased by that option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| because it's less invasive for everyone and will get us quicker to our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1744)|
| 0:29:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Nancy said that earlier, but KUB and their engineering has really worked well on that, great partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1750)|

| 0:30:33| All voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Yeah, I wonder if Bob could just run us through this real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| I understand we're working with KCDC and I'm not sure how that sort of inter-role thing works out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| So if you would describe it for us, it would be helpful, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| I could do that, but once again, the thing of the night, Jordana Nelson will come and explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| She's worked very hard on putting this development agreement together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| She can give you the best explanation at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| Well, thank you for having me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Again, Jordana Nelson with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Can you pull the mic a little closer to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Jordana Nelson with KCDC, 4019 Tallulah Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| This development agreement relates to the construction of Sutry Landing Park and the related roadway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| And as I think you all are aware, there was several years ago a district TIF authorized for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1880)|
| 0:31:30| That enables you to give a TIF? Is that what that does?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| If you have a redevelopment district, you can then have a TIF? Is that how that works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| Yes, and it's authorized either in the original redevelopment plan or by amendment to a redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1896)|
| 0:31:44| In this case, this TIF was authorized in the redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| And so this agreement will facilitate the use of proceeds of the TIF to construct Sutry Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1908)|
| 0:31:56| And the agreement is between the city and KCDC because the city right now is the lender on that TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1916)|
| 0:32:04| KCDC currently owns the property, and then we'll be borrowing the money to construct the improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| Borrowing the money from the city or from a bank, or how are you doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1929)|
| 0:32:13| From the city, currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| And then you manage the construction contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| Well, actually, in this case, the city's redevelopment department will be managing the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| They felt better equipped to handle it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| All right, and then after the development is completed, how do you then work with the city to get repayment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1947)|
| 0:32:34| That's the part I would like to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| So the repayment of the TIF, I assume, is what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Yes, I guess so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| And so the incremental revenues generated by the property tax increases in the south waterfront generate the revenue stream to repay the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1962)|
| 0:32:53| Inland from the road and the park, you're going to improve values, and that's how you're going to get the money back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Right, well, generally, in this case, because there are so many public improvements in the south waterfront,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| the idea is that it will spur private development and increase private property values, and those increased revenues will repay the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1984)|
| 0:33:13| Okay, so it's the infrastructure that drives your hoping development, and that will result in a higher tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| Right, that was the plan with the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Bob's shaking his head, so you want to have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2005)|
| 0:33:26| That's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2006)|
| 0:33:27| Okay, incentivize private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| Well, that's where we started, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| We made the decision to try to prime the pump here and do this public improvement first, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| And this agreement talks about how it gets done, the legal, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Well, so, I mean, just for clarity's sake, I mean, this is what this is actually the beginning of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| This is the beginning of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| With the next item on your agenda, we will have the vote to start the waterfront road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| and this development agreement clearly identifies what role KCDC has and what role the city has as we go forward in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| This agreement just relates to the Sutry Landing Park improvements and the related road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| There have been a lot of other public improvements in the south waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2057)|

| 0:35:18| What you were asking for is a TVA hurdle that we're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| That's with Sutry Landing Park proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| And due to some grading modifications, they're still doing the TVA review for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| And once that approval gets met through the Corps and TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| we'll be able to move forward with the park construction soon after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2133)|
| 0:35:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2138)|

| 0:35:45| But hopefully within the last couple of, maybe six more weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| we have a no-rise certification to do before we get that approved to go through the park process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2149)|
| 0:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Well, anything else you want to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Well, the history of this is based on eight months ago we started our constructability review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| based on plans that were shelved from 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| And we hired a consultant to come on board and do that constructability review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| to bring those documents up to 100% completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| So here we are ready to begin with phase one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| They also looked at construction phasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| And because of the delay on the park, we moved forward with construction on Waterfront Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| So we put that out to bid in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| And here we are requesting approval to move that project forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| Well, and the park part of it, obviously, is the icing on the cake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| Of course, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2196)|
| 0:36:37| I mean, that's what folks are really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| But I'm really excited just to see something begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| Well, this railway network will also spur the adjacent private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| that's going to have to access Waterfront Drive as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| And I understand completely why we haven't done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| And I agreed at that time with Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| We talked about it at length, and I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| And I'm also excited for us to go ahead and begin the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| because, I mean, it's huge not only just for South Knoxville but for all of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| Everything that's happening down on the waterfront, I mean, this is just one more thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| that will spur activity, will support the former Baptist site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| the apartments that are going in at the tank farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| I mean, there's just a lot of excitement, a lot of investment there associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| And this gets us started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| It's not, again, what everybody is waiting for, but I'm glad to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| Yeah, this is our second public improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| We have one partially completed with the Riverwalk Extension on the west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| and now we're moving forward with Sutree Landing Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| and that associated railway network as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| But what we did learn in that constructability review is that there were some lessons learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| as well as some additional requests from TVA, the Corps, and TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| in order to move that project that was incomplete to completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| And so we will be coming back within the next council period to request additional change order requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2276)|
| 0:38:05| because of those things to rebuild and reconstruct and redevelop on the Brownfield site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Did you want to add more, Bob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Don Michelle or Bob, don't go too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Just a simple question on the back page of this information sheet is a sketch of the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| and obviously it's a band along the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| It's a very slender park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| It's about five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| Right, about five acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| And the thing that stands out to me as troubling, and I'm sure there's a reason for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| I just want to know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| There's a triangle on the left or west side that is called the water feature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| and I'm wondering why any park that runs along the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| do we need to add an inland water feature that might create problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| What is its purpose, and why not just use the river as the water feature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| Well, the water quality feature is to make sure your stormwater outflow is going to be clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| They had worked with TDEC and the Corps as well as getting that re-permitted as a water quality feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2343)|
| 0:39:11| because it was once a wetland area, but it did not hydrate very well as a wetland area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| so it was re-modified based on the Corps and TDEC's requirements to get it as a water quality area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| Is it a detention pond for the development across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| It would work pretty much like a rain garden and filter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Filter water back into the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| And it won't be like a detention pond because you're this close to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| What you want to do is move the water on off from the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| But you want to filter it before you do that, and that's what this is designed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| So it's a natural filter, and that's why we have the water feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| That explains it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| 11J is a resolution supplementing Resolution Number R-12990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| adopted by the City Council of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee on May 15, 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| providing for the issuance of not to exceed $30 million of wastewater system revenue bond Series 2014-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Okay, we have to do these by roll call, by our charter, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| Just because the money people require us to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| The money people require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| I think Mark Walker is here from KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and he generously explained this along with Bo Cole to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2430)|
| 0:40:36| There are several things about the next three items we're doing by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| The $40 million electrical system bonds, the $30 million wastewater bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| and the $8 million water system bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| And I know you guys are in the middle of a lot of upgrading of the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| and there's a lot of costs related to that on the wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Of course, we're under a court order, I suppose, or you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| There's a couple of features of this bond I want you to explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| because I think the taxpayers need to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| One is it's based on the revenues from KUB's operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| and not a city-backed bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| First, Mark Walker, I'm CFO of Knoxville Utilities Board, 8528 Cambridge Woods Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| Councilman Delva, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| The bonds are secured by the revenues of KUB's systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| No revenues from the city or taxability from the city can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Tax income to the city can be used to pay these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| It's all obligations of KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| It must be paid with revenues of the respective systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| And then the second thing I wanted to ask you about, and I think you explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| but I'm not sure it all sunk in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| but the idea that each of these three bond issues has a certain minimum debt coverage ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| that relates to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| I'm going to give you the poor layman's version and then you give me the real explanation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| but the idea is that you have done sufficient analysis and calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| that you have more net revenues after you pay all your operating expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| to more than cover the cost of repaying the bond holders, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| who are lending their money to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| If you could explain that process, that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| Each of the divisions that has outstanding bonds, which is true for all of KUB's divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| we have covenants in our bond resolutions that council has approved as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| that set forth covenants that basically state we must maintain a certain coverage level for our bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2550)|
| 0:42:37| meaning, for example, we have to, our maximum debt service over the life of the wastewater bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| may be $20 million or $30 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| That's the maximum payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| We must have at least 1.5 times that to maintain our AA bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| It's basically a threshold that we've established with the rating agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| that we will show the ability to repay the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2579)|
| 0:43:03| You actually exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| You have 1.62 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| 1.62.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| The minimum threshold for wastewater is 1.5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| and the minimum thresholds vary depending upon the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| For water, it's 2.0, actually, and for electric, it's 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| And in each case, you exceed those minimums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| So that's KUB's financial look at this, saying we have sufficient revenues under our system to cover the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2600)|
| 0:43:29| We're not going to default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2609)|

| 0:47:17| Yes, I wanted to ask, do these officers, are they walking through the various housing projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2837)|
| 0:47:24| They walk, they ride, they do ID checkpoints occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2844)|

| 0:48:07| I did just want to do a little clarification with regards to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| because the question was asked was that additional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| I want to make sure that you're clear as counsel what we mean by service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| KPD is providing additional assistance to working with KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| such as officers coming and attending the Resident Association meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| stopping by and meeting with managers at our housing sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| participating in events that are going on inside of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| So it's really more of a strategy type of approach to delivering service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| So it's not that they're providing additional service because of additional calls coming to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| It's a working relationship to allow us to develop a better policing strategy for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| The increment, the new part, or the additional part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| is really to address this managerial kind of interaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| That allows us to continue to receive all of the hours that we're currently receiving at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| because we're helping offset some additional costs through the increase in salaries and cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=2937)|

| 0:50:22| Councilman Dallamope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| I guess this is for David and not Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| I'm not sure who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3026)|
| 0:50:27| But anyway, when that park was set up, there was a certain amount put in place for construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3027)|
| 0:50:34| and then there was a certain amount that was supposed to be put in trust for maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3034)|
| 0:50:39| Is this coming from that, or this is just a periodic thing we have to do where we have to maintain the water feature out of our pocket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| David Bray, City Public Service, 2208 Fisher Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Mr. York will talk about the funding source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| We do obviously handle day-to-day maintenance, which comes out of our operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| You've got the workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Yeah, the day-to-day work that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| This is, again, that every 15-year overhaul that you need to do on any facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| And I believe that we are using resources from that fund, but I would have to look at Mr. York.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3062)|
| 0:51:07| I just remember that old TVA photographer left a decent amount of money in trust to the city to both build the park and maintain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3067)|
| 0:51:15| and I was wondering if this was coming out of that pot or our pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| The trust left two portions, one which said that at least half the corpus must remain for investment purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3083)|
| 0:51:36| and the other half can be used for either expansion or maintenance of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| This project is coming out of that portion that is set aside that can be used for maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3102)|
| 0:51:49| but it is coming from the trust fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| All right, so we're following through on what he set up originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3114)|
| 0:51:55| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3118)|

| 0:53:03| at an annual premium not to exceed $250,340.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3183)|

| 0:53:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Yeah, I think I saw Gary out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| I don't know if he's still here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| Just tell us briefly, as I understand it, we picked up the workers' comp for the CAT system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3196)|
| 0:53:23| and that there was supposed to be a savings of money being part of our bigger plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| Can you just describe that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| This gives us the cost for the excess coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| How does this work in the context of us assuming more workers' comp responsibility under the new way we manage KTA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3211)|
| 0:53:40| Okay, Gary Eastis, the city's risk manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| We did, as of last July 1, self-insured and began administering the claims for CAT as well as for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3223)|
| 0:53:54| The improved cost is really from reducing the profit that the insurance company was going to make from fully insuring those claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3234)|
| 0:54:04| By self-insuring the first $2 million or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| We really can administer the claims, I think, more efficiently than an insurance company can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3250)|
| 0:54:17| because we're already set up to do that, staffed to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| and also because we're buying much less insurance because we're only buying excess insurance, not fully insuring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3260)|
| 0:54:27| Fully insuring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| We're reducing a lot of the costs there that otherwise would go to the insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| How many workers are in the KTA coverage that we're talking about here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| It's 300 and around 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| It's 300-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| That's the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3290)|

| 0:54:53| 12B is an ordinance amending the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 6, Article 2E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3293)|
| 0:54:58| by adopting Chapters 3 through 12 in Appendix B of the 2012 edition of the International Green Construction Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| Councilman Delivanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Yeah, I just wanted to ask Christy a question, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| My memory was that we're about to actually put into effect on July 1 the first two chapters of this green code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3312)|
| 0:55:20| and this is sort of picking up the balance, so to speak, the remaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| Do I have the right section here or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| I hope I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| The additional chapters from 2 to 11 or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| Just tell us about that because we really don't have any active experience yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| but it is voluntary whether it's the first two chapters or the remaining seven or eight or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| Well, the first two chapters were administrative chapters, and this is the substantive portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3340)|
| 0:55:46| And our Director of Permits and Inspections, Peter Ahrens, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| If you want to ask him any specific questions about the implementation of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| Yeah, I guess I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| We haven't gone through this learning curve yet of applying the first two chapters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3356)|
| 0:56:00| How do we know that we're ready for the remaining number that we're picking up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| As you recall, in 2012 we had the task force where we studied this green code for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| and since then Peter and his staff have been reviewing all the requirements in the administration rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| and then reviewing the substantive portion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| After reviewing all that, we felt like we were ready to adopt this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| and we're all going to learn once someone goes through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| It's in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| We hope someone elects to follow the green construction code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| and then we'll be able to do our plans review and our inspections under this green code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| So we're all going to be learning together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Right, and we're still going to be in this evaluation phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| where we might have to tweak something in the code before it becomes mandatory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| Yes, there will be lots of things that we will have to tweak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| but it is a period of time where we're all going to be learning together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| and we'll figure out what those items are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3414)|

| 0:57:46| Yeah, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| I just wanted Jim to maybe, I believe I talked to Becky about clarifying this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| and basically this just cleans it up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| because I know the city has drawn the line in the sand, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| as far as Gerdau's growth into the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| Is that correct, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3483)|

| 0:58:20| than they really wanted, as it turned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| They didn't take into account turnarounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| and there was some other property that they planned to acquire, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| So we're actually taking some back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| So it's basically just it's cleanup of the old one to match the final results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3513)|
| 0:58:39| with their plat as it worked through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3519)|

| 0:59:54| So let me impress upon everyone, anything is possible with faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| just an honest degree of humility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| So I've been talking to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| My name is Melissa Ann Root, 1805 3rd Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| About a safe transit program to eliminate drinking and driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| This is our current busing system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| It's a spider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Spiders are the universal symbol for connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| Everybody says, Melissa, you're full of hot air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| They're never going to go for this, from bar owners to patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| The only people who are really on board with this are the people who like to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| and have a good time and not worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| That's most of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| So with this hot air balloon, I've got a basket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Where's the balloon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| We have everything we need, and I believe we can do this with little or no cost to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| with the addition of a leisure passenger train to encircle the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3648)|
| 1:00:54| We have the tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| We actually have the cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| They're resting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| We can clean them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| And every one of these businesses I've listened to you all talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| who are on board for this, that, and the other in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| will jump on board to put their names on these trains to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| This will capture the tourism I've been talking about, bringing to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| that's passing us by because, oh, wait, that helps develop northeast and south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| because west is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| That helps enrich the community every way humanly possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| And when people want to go out and have a good time, riding the bus is not cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Riding the bus to catch the train and see the mountains, see the river, see the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| to go out and have a good time is a grand time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| We all go to Dollywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| We walk the same park to get on the little train,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| to ride around the same park we just walked to get to the train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| It's not just a novelty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| It's a degree of romance and leisure relaxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Every human being on the planet can enjoy and partake of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| to capture finally the tourism we've been craving my entire lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| And I've grown up here, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| When I was a kid, you drove past Westtown, you saw horses and cows, and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3719)|
| 1:02:06| So I've seen Knoxville grow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| I'm ready to see Knoxville grow up some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| This is my dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| I am working to make it a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Where do I go next to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| We'll get the KTA board meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| Where do I go to get this train idea cemented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| Really, as I mentioned to you last time, it's really CAT who deals with transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3746)|
| 1:02:31| So I think you were in touch with Mr. Smith, who's on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| So that's really they really are the ones who vet that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| Okay, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| Doesn't Pete call someone on the train tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265140624?start=3761)|
