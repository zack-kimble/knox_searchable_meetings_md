| 0:00:30| Welcome to the Board of Education's July 13, 2023 regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=35)|
| 0:00:40| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=40)|
| 0:01:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=64)|
| 0:01:15| So just a few announcements tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=75)|
| 0:01:18| First, Ms. Spike will not be in attendance due to out-of-town travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=78)|
| 0:01:22| Also, our teachers will report back to the classroom for the fall semester on Tuesday, August 1, and students will be back for the new school year on Tuesday, August 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=82)|
| 0:01:32| On behalf of the board, I would like to wish our staff, students, and families a wonderful 23-24 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=92)|
| 0:01:39| For those in attendance tonight, we are glad you chose to attend this meeting, but please note that elevated noise makes it difficult for us to hear each other, as well as for you to hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=99)|
| 0:01:51| So if you do need to speak to someone sitting beside you, we ask that you step out of the room to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=111)|
| 0:01:57| Also, board members, we ask that you speak into your microphones so those watching at home can hear as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=117)|
| 0:02:07| Changes to the agenda, as was noted on Monday's work session, Item 10G has been added to tonight's agenda regarding a contract with France Law Group to pursue claims associated with social media litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=127)|
| 0:02:21| Also, board members, you received an updated revised version of board policy I-122 via email, and the updated version is also attached to the electronic agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=141)|
| 0:02:32| And Mr. DuPort, did we have any other changes to the agenda tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| Yes, Madam Chair. So right before I came over here, and while I was a couple minutes late, the Instructure contract, which, what item is that, Terry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=158)|
| 0:02:51| 9B, you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| Okay. We were in negotiations with Instructure and thought we would have to push this, but I mean, 30 minutes before the meeting itself, the negotiations broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=175)|
| 0:03:11| There is one change to what's on the agenda. A paragraph has been added regarding acceptance within 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=191)|
| 0:03:21| So, I mean, I can pass this around for the board. I know it's not ideal, but basically this has been now approved by Knox County Procurement and approved by Instructure, so it's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=201)|
| 0:03:35| I mean, but it's immediate, right before the board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=215)|
| 0:03:38| And you have the updated version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| I do. I have it in my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| All right. Okay. So are there any other requested changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=222)|
| 0:03:52| So we have a motion by Ms. Horne and a second by Mr. Triplett. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| So, Dr. Roswick, I think we have a report today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I'll actually have Dr. Wilson queue him up to be ready to launch with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=250)|
| 0:04:17| Just, I think you all remember, it's been a year, but we talked about really working on trying to get, using our regional structure in a way that we could engage more families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=257)|
| 0:04:26| kind of based on geography and a little closer, kind of the idea that one size doesn't fit all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| and that we could have folks really be able to speak to issues and things that pertain to kind of their part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=272)|
| 0:04:39| And so we have both family councils and teacher councils for all regions, and we have our regional directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| and Dr. Wilson here to kind of give a summary of what happened for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| Thank you, Dr. Roswick. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| We're actually really excited tonight to be able to come back and share a little more information about the work that happened this year with our regional teacher and family councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=292)|
| 0:05:00| And actually, to get us started, we've got a couple of our regional directors that are going to take us through a little bit of information about the work over the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=300)|
| 0:05:07| We're also honored tonight to have a representative from one of our teacher councils and one from one of our family councils to share a little bit about their experience throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=307)|
| 0:05:16| In addition, as I'll speak a little bit later in the presentation, if you'll remember when we were talking about the school calendar for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=316)|
| 0:05:24| I mentioned that when we came around to talking about family councils and teacher councils, we were going to talk a little more about early release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| We're going to share a little bit of information about that as well, as that was some information that we gleaned from our time with our councils this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=331)|
| 0:05:38| With that, I'm going to turn it over to Megan O'Dell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| Thank you very much, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| I'll get started with how our regional council worked this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=349)|
| 0:05:53| As you know, in the past, we've had a district council, a teacher council, and a district family council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| This year, we decided to break it into the regions so we could get more personal in terms of size and in terms of making sure we're addressing what's happening in each region because that looks very different from region to region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=360)|
| 0:06:12| We selected council members based on reviewing applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| Members were asked to apply for the different councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| We tried to ensure that we had one representative from every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| We also had five at-large seats so we could make sure there was equal representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| For example, if one school, for some reason, did not have a council member that applied, we would try to make sure to pick from another school for that at-large seat that's in that same geographical location to make sure we had those representations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=390)|
| 0:06:43| Across the regions, the structure looked the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| However, the outcomes were different because our regions are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Just know we tried to follow the same structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| As far as that goes, I'll start with teacher councils first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| We began in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=416)|
| 0:06:57| Our goal was to meet every other month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| We got started a little later than we had hoped for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| Beginning next school year, we will meet four times with our councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| This year, with each one of them, we met three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| We started with the teacher councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| The beginning was just to introduce them to the council structure, really try to understand the district priorities and what our regional data looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=432)|
| 0:07:22| We did a lot of digging into regional data from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| We charged them with leaving there to administer surveys around the teacher field and what it meant to be a teacher in our different regions and what were pros and cons and challenges and what were great things that were happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=446)|
| 0:07:41| That next meeting, we brought the information back from those surveys to dive into really understanding what those challenges were that were presented in our region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=461)|
| 0:07:53| In all the different regions and narrowed down to two focus areas, at least two that we were looking at focusing in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=473)|
| 0:08:02| Then developed a survey within our own teacher council to take back to their schools around those two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| At the very end, we dove even deeper into that, just narrowing the focus into what would recommendations be that the councils would suggest around the areas of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=489)|
| 0:08:22| The same kind of structure followed with the family council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| Once again, starting in December, meeting every other month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| Once again, starting with the big picture of here's our district, here's our regions, getting to know each other, what that looks like, kind of looking through that regional data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=510)|
| 0:08:39| Then assigning a survey to go out to families, but it was geared more toward what's the family interaction that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=519)|
| 0:08:47| It was more of what's that family experience and where areas to help us learn of what's going great and what are areas we could work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=527)|
| 0:08:55| Then diving even deeper into once we identified those areas, creating ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| We did a homework assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| Every region did it a little different, but once we narrowed that focus down of how we could gather more information and then identify next steps and suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=542)|
| 0:09:11| I'm going to turn it over next to Ms. Cindy, and she's going to go over the different themes that came out of the councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| Thank you, Megan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| I'm Cindy White, Region 4 Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| Megan talked a little bit about the process, the data that was used, the surveys, the regional data, and then the district data in order to get to those focus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=562)|
| 0:09:35| What we found is in all five regions that even though there are unique needs in each of the five regions, we found that there were some common focus areas and then common themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=575)|
| 0:09:45| That's what I'm going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| One thing that they did point out was that the in-service that's provided by KCS when compared to other districts, it's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=587)|
| 0:09:56| There are lots of opportunities for professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| What they suggested was that we just needed to start with improving the systems that we already had in place for professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| Where they saw the value was in the collaboration piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| This is district learning day and professional learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| They wanted the opportunity to be able to collaborate with their colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=618)|
| 0:10:21| They wanted the opportunity to hear from their peers and what was working and what was being successful with their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| They wanted their learning to be relevant to what they were doing in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| They did want differentiation based on experience and content, but generally they did value the professional learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=632)|
| 0:10:42| Again, it was all about the collaboration and the opportunity to collaborate and plan with their peers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=642)|
| 0:10:53| Another common theme was the professional learning communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| They do see value, again, in the professional learning communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| They see value in collaborating and planning around student data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| What they did recognize is that that practice is inconsistent from school to school, even within schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=667)|
| 0:11:14| What they also found was that time has to be built into the school day in order to put that practice into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=674)|
| 0:11:22| One of their recommendations was administrators, instructional coaches, department chairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| we needed to go back and look at the purpose and best practices of PLCs and then look at what's working and what's not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=687)|
| 0:11:34| so that we can make sure that what we're doing is data driven and collaborative around student outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| But again, they saw the value in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| They just wanted to work on strengthening some of what we had in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| On early release, teachers saw value in the time that was set aside for early release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| but again, a lack of consistency and coherence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=714)|
| 0:11:58| Additional information at the end of the council, the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| surveys were put out to principals, council members, families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=723)|
| 0:12:07| Dr. Wilson will talk about that in just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Now that was teacher council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| For family councils, it boiled down to, and we know that when we deal with families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| it's generally always going to be around communication, and so there were two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| They broke communication down into two areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| The tools that we were using to communicate and then the frequency and the information that was being communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| So they were really overall, they were very positive about ParentSquare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=751)|
| 0:12:37| They saw they understood the purpose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=757)|
| 0:12:40| They saw it as a great tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=760)|
| 0:12:42| But what they would like is some consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| They did acknowledge the fact that when there were errors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| it was just due to the fact that it was the first year that we were implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| So what their suggestion was is that we really need to have additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| for both families, parents, and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| so that everybody understood the full capability of the tool and understood how to use the tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| But again, they understood the purpose in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| As far as frequency and topics, again, acknowledging the fact that communication between families and the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| it's everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| And so what they wanted through that communication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| they wanted to make sure that they had an advance notice about events and things going on in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| because they wanted to be engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| So one of their points was that regardless of the school that a child attends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| there needs to be a consistent expectation for not only when we communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| but the frequency of communication, but the information that we do share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| So one of their examples was that if we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| one of their recommendations was if we can choose a day of the week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| let's say that all communication from every school in the district goes out on Wednesdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| parents know to expect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=841)|
| 0:14:03| and then there is a minimum standard for what we're going to communicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| upcoming dates, things going on in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| then the parents know that anything else that comes out from the school or from the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| it's either time sensitive or there's a sense of urgency surrounding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| So, and again, they want, families want communication about what's happening in the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| But again, they were very generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| They acknowledged the fact that teachers are overwhelmed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| and so they were very reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| They just wanted to know, they wanted some general information about what was going on in those classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| We now have, we've invited a teacher council representative, Chelsea Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| She'll be the next to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| She's going to speak about her experience working on the teacher council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| and then Courtney Childers will talk about her experience working through the family council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=888)|
| 0:14:54| Hi, I'm Chelsea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| I teach at Hardin Valley Elementary in fifth grade math, region two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| and it was an absolute pleasure to serve on the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=902)|
| 0:15:06| I kind of went into it thinking that it would be, not to sound like a downer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| but that it would be somewhat of a, we were spoken to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| and kind of more of a one-sided conversation, and it was completely not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| It was engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| Christy and Nathan were absolutely fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| They asked tough questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| but they were also willing to listen to some tough criticism coming back from their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| But then they took it a step further, and they didn't let us get bogged down in negativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| They constantly were challenging us with what would be our next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| and I'm really excited to see where the council goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| and to see what those next steps look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| I felt like we were met with some great conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| and in my, I think this, if I'm counting correctly, is my 27th year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| this starts my 27th year teaching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| and it's probably the most heard I've ever felt like as an educator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| They listened, and kudos to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| The first meeting, that very first one, there was a lot coming at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| and they took it, and then they ran with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| and they challenged us to dig a little bit deeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| and hone in on some things that we could actually have a positive impact with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| and I was absolutely delighted with the entire process, to be perfectly honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| It's the best experience, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| in terms of conversing with any level of administration that I've ever encountered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=994)|
| 0:16:41| It was a really, truly great experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| That's it from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| Okay, so it's going to be a tough act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| I'm Courtney Smith, and I'm going to be your moderator for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| Okay, so it's going to be a tough act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| I'm Courtney Childers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| I've had two kids in the Farragut school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| part of Region 1 since 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| Technically, I represented Farragut Intermediate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| but last year also had a student at Farragut Primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| Overwhelmingly, our experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| and I think I can kind of speak for all the parents in Region 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| we felt like this gave us tremendous voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| to kind of echo what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| I know that the superintendent earlier said that some of these council meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| were kind of set up to foster engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| and I would say that that goal was absolutely met within our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1052)|
| 0:17:38| It was an honor, to be honest, for me to be able to serve in this capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| and I think that all the other parents that were part of our region would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| If nothing else, I think that most parents want to be able to connect with their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| teachers, and administrators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| We just don't always have time or have a purpose to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| and this forced me to do that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| It forced me to find time to speak to Ms. Parham,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| and to make sure that multiple teachers within Farragut Intermediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| could express concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and, you know, shout the kudos, too, when they had the chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| I felt like my role was partly to be the voice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| I felt like my role was partly to be their advocate on the family council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| so anytime I met with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| whether it was a phone interview or a face-to-face conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| if they brought up something that I felt was important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| I felt like I could speak for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| and also share that advocacy role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| So it just gave us the opportunity overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| to learn more about the district as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Region 1 is very large and very geographically diverse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| and so getting the chance to learn from parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| and hear other concerns from parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| to have students outside of the Farragut bubble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| that we kind of live and breathe in was very, very interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| and also something that I found| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| to be a special experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| Our particular region found two key initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| to bring forward. Communication was one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| so I think we've heard a lot about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| but communication is key and parents want more of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| and we want it in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| And the other key initiative from Region 1 was focused on connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| between the teacher, the curriculum, and the parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| so what resources does the district overall have to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| help our students when they get home, our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| And to be honest, they shared so many resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| that none of us knew existed, and I was on a region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| that was represented by high school students all the way down to primary age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| and so the resources are vast, and I would just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| implore Knox County to continue to share those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1176)|
| 0:19:39| because, you know, especially coming out of the COVID season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| some of these students need additional help and additional resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| But overall, I just applaud| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Knox County Schools for giving us the opportunity to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| in this capacity and to bring the student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| perspective, the parent perspective, the administrative perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| all to you all in both the region and the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| and hopefully you'll continue the council experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| All right, so I'm tasked with sort of wrapping things up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| but part of wrapping that up is actually to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| which I think is a cool outcome of the work that happened this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| which was when we saw the sort of common themes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| that came out of our teacher councils, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| around early release and that being a new practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| and us being in a pilot, it was an opportunity to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| well, let's learn a little more about what is happening on these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| and if there is any type of impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| or notion about how these could be improved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1238)|
| 0:20:41| let's lean back in and see what we can learn about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| And so we pushed a follow-up survey to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| We primarily heard that from our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| so we sent that back out to our teacher council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| and I want to say something that's cool, like if you look at these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| we had 62 of our teacher council members across the regions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| that replied, which is a really small number or fraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| if you think of the weight of all the teachers that we have in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| but as you have already heard, one of the things we challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| all the council members with this year was as we approach problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| and we think about solutions, to think with a representative mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| because it may not be you that's dealing with the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| or your perception, your challenge may be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| that when we sent them back on a lot of tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| the challenge was to dialogue with others, to survey others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| to learn more about how does your whole staff feel about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| and to really think about when you're here representing your school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| or as a family member representing the families in your school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| then bring that mindset and be challenged to think in that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| and I think we heard a few examples of that even in what was shared here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| So in thinking about it, it is a small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| but these were folks who really had been immersed in those types of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| and in the work throughout the year, and we felt really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| about the return on a survey for that size of group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| about 100 folks or so, 120, having that many back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| And then we sent it to our principals as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| which was a group at that point we really hadn't asked that question to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1319)|
| 0:22:02| and again, out of 91, 92 principals, we got back 63 answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| so we felt like they wanted to talk about it in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| So there were some common items that emerged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| that I think we should consider and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| and really just some things I would highlight tonight that we learned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| So first we asked both our teachers and our principals on these days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| kind of who was doing the work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| So who led these activities, who facilitated the conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| and whether you're looking at either the teacher feedback there on top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| or the principal feedback, it was obvious that administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| were most often identified as the people who were kind of standing at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| The way this question was arranged, you could identify all that applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| but they were the most commonly identified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| which again, we think about some of that work we've been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| with department chairs and trying to reframe that job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| and again, a point of consideration as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| about how we continue to use those positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| since we're looking at an SR item, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| We want to think about that, and certainly they showed up in this activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| or in doing these activities and helping to lead that professional learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| What types of activities were happening during these days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| And that top item there you see is cut off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| you can see that the most highly rated items for both groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| were the PLCs, collaborative planning, time for teachers to work together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| and in that thought process, you've already heard feedback saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| that's what teachers are saying they want more of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| and so we see in that feedback that that was probably the most common thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| that was identified or maybe utilized during those times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| but also quite a bit of professional development workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| which would be more presentation-based, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| things like that were identified fairly heavily too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| Principals identified also the analysis of student assessments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| and content department meetings a little more often than teachers did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| in that feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| I thought this was really cool in the sense, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| we really didn't hear a lot from parents about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| I will say, and if I was counting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| I would say probably two, three times throughout the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| we did hear a phone message or an email about early release days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| from maybe an employer that said, you know, this is really hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| my employee is having to miss today because they had to pick their kid up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| you know, that kind of thing, but very rare throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| literally like single digits, I think, throughout the whole year on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| And coming back to that, what families reported in these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| was that they really were ready for these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| They felt like the district had communicated with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| and that in most cases they were able to adjust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| and they were able to make sure that they had after-school transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| for a student or after-school care, that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| the communication was on a sufficient timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| that they were able to prepare for these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| And I will say, back to that representative mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| and some of the open comment items, though, we also had families that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| hey, I answered this question really positively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| but I also recognize that there's people who maybe don't have extended family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| and maybe don't have the ability to pivot on these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| And so it is something we should consider as we think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| how these days are structured and how we use them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| When we asked the principals, kind of just some open-ended items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| largely our principals, and again, knowing a little bit of the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| which was a little prior to me being in this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| this sort of sprung out of a desire from our administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| to have more time to do some of that school-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| school-specific professional development and learning with their staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| And so principals in response saw a lot of value in this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| and being added back. That was an important resource to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1525)|
| 0:25:28| They were able to make some plans for learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| that were tailored to their needs, and it wasn't something we were setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1531)|
| 0:25:34| the agenda for for them as a district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| and really about how it started the dialogue to really honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| what it takes for teachers to plan and prepare and be ready to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| what they need to do every day in a classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| And teachers really, I mean, and again, the feedback being that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| it wasn't that they didn't want to engage in these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| They really do see value in these types of opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| but they also see opportunities for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Some of the comments were very pointed in saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| this is the way I think you can improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| And so I really appreciated these to say, you know what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| this was a learning experience. We can see ways that this could be better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| and we think that as a staff and administrative team working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| we can have a better process for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| And again, that kind of second comment is, it can be productive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| it can be beneficial, we just have to keep working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| So again, I think a willingness to engage and to do that work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| I will share one pie chart with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| And when asked, would you support Knox County Schools'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| continued use of these scheduled early release days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| you can see parents and teachers, as far as overall agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| were really close to each other, and principals felt really strongly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| about continuing to use these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| And so I think our desire would be to have all those numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| be really close to one another, and again, I think still positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| that a majority of our folks, whether we're talking parents or teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| or principals, can still say that hey, even in this first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| where we're all recognizing things could be polished up a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| we still saw value and positive results in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| But again, this is something I think if we think about future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| data collection and surveys, we want to continue to pay attention to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| is this something that we would continue to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| So we'll just kind of read you a few of these more specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Our suggestions and future considerations based on different groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| and their feedback, and I've kind of highlighted if it's a T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| it's a teacher, P is a principal, and F would be from our family council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| First and foremost, clear across all of this from our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| and our teachers was clear guidance and consistency for how to use this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| Whether that means school to school, we're approaching it from the same lens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| and requiring the same things of our staff and our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| and then also just if I'm a principal and I understood that the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| was this, but I heard Principal X across town did it differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| and they got to include this type of activity, just that we need to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1669)|
| 0:27:53| on what it is we're trying to establish on these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Monitoring the amount of new learning and ensuring that teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| have time for application and practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| And that actually was called out both by teachers and at least one principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| comment to say, we throw a lot at teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Let's make sure that as we are chunking new learning and we're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| about what we're going to do next year, that we're not throwing so much at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| that they never have a chance to actually do with it and go back and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| So that's something to be conscious of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| Let's be careful it's not just another staff meeting, because that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| the design or the intent of these days, and we need to hold ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| accountable for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| More, you saw already that that was the most highlighted thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| this idea of using the time for planning and collaboration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| maybe extending your PLCs, we want more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| You heard that in the feedback already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1719)|
| 0:28:42| From everybody, the question of, could we consider scheduling these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| as true half days for the early release?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| Both from just a time challenge, by the time parents are able to pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| and get, especially elementary school, get cleared and get off campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| and then teachers get back together and try to accomplish anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| there is a time constraint there, because these are typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| a two hour release early rather than a true half day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1740)|
| 0:29:03| There are some scheduling implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| That trade with inclement weather days that we made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1746)|
| 0:29:09| it would require additional for us to do that in terms of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| we would buy back, but that's something to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| and again was brought up by all three groups in the feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Continuing both our teachers and our principals identified to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| to monitor student attendance during these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| and making sure that parents find value in what their students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| are engaging in on these days, and that we're making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| that we don't create any issues for ourselves with attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| in messaging and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| I think a challenge for us on this is going to be to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| to monitor that return on investment as we consider that we're trading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| some instructional time on these days for some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| and then also there is a schedule disruption when you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| what families have to plan for and be prepared for on these days as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| That's something to continue to monitor as we look through this next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| Next steps for regional councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| An immediate next step, you're watching one of them right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| is this share out to you guys to be aware of what the work has been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| and we are working through some revised guidance and expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| pertaining to early release days to help our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| be better prepared this year, to have that clarity around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| what it is exactly that we were after, and we've been having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| some internal conversations to be able to clearly communicate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| with the staff as they start to plan and put those activities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| You've heard a little bit about the communications piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| and we're also working to make some of those calls and suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| through our regional directors about how to better use the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| of Parent Square and make sure that everybody is trained on the features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| and knows how to do those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| I thought it was funny Monday night we heard a lot of that feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| when we heard from the other group about communication and Parent Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| and all the different ways we communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| It was echoing a lot of what we heard through the parent council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| In ongoing fashion, we want to continue to utilize these findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| that we have with different pertinent groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| We want to hear what the parents and our teachers have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| and are really anxious to know how to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| and how to use that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| Sharing that with them is something they've asked for and we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| to continue to do in meaningful ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| Our KCS department heads who are responsible for things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| professional learning, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| We also have a new feature this year, a new grouping that we're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| about from an engagement standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| We had a selection of 20 principals or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| You get 20 principals that are elementary to high school in a room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| and you put all of the issues that a principal could experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| and you get in there and try to get to a productive outcome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| with all that they do and are responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| It's really challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| What we figured out is getting into the work and really understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| where are the places we can lean in and can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| It takes sometimes smaller audiences and I think smaller focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1911)|
| 0:31:54| We're shifting this year to what we're calling a division service council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| As you know, our assistant superintendents are all over a division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| We have academics, student success, business and talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| Really creating some groups that are co-led| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| by a small principal group and a division head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| From that, really establishing an agenda to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| what is it this year that are these issues within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| maybe business and talent or within academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| That we can lean into and really deepen our understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| and continue to push in for ways to make that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| A great living example that I think that we've already had would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| we've had a really good staffing committee process this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| where we brought principals in to sit in that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| and really talk through staffing and where were the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| and what kind of things do we need to adjust and think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| when we're trying to staff our schools adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| You guys heard about a lot of that through your budget cycle meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| The kind of work that could stem from one of these councils is to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| this is something that's important to us and something we need to lean into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| That's a new process. Our principals are going to hear more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| actually tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1976)|
| 0:32:59| We'll be doing some recruiting to establish those councils| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| in the coming month or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Obviously, ongoing is to begin to start to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| our 23-24 regional family and teacher councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| You've already heard that those will be starting a little bit earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| this year. We are moving that to an online application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Last year we did an online process for our parent council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| We did a paper process through the school for our teacher council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| We're going to move both of those to an online process this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| that will run through our community engagement webpage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| where we've got our other council things listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| We're shooting for August 1st, so we're working hard to get to that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Corey and I are working together on that and to establish our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| that will carry us through for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| One last thing that's on my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| I always like to take a chance to brag on my people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| and you all don't get a lot of FaceTime with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| The regional directors and supervisors that are in the room tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| have done just a phenomenal job of really being out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| building the relationships, connecting with not only their principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| but their families and their teachers this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2039)|
| 0:34:02| Hopefully, we're only hearing from a couple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| but I think the tone has really been positive about the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| and I would also thank Corey who, much earlier on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| as we were trying to figure out what this process would look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| she was always willing to come and sit in and help map that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| These are not my strong suit. I'll stand up and talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| but the design phase was not my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| She's been really instrumental in helping us as a team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| think about what this needed to include and what should be the outcomes of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| and will be how we continue to think about it in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Just wanted to take a moment to thank those folks too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| Awesome. Thank you, Dr. Wilson and Ms. Gills and Ms. Childers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| for being here tonight and sharing your experiences with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| I will say that I have found value in having the regional structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| I mean, I love working with Megan and Tommy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| and it has made my job a little easier as a board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| having that direct contact when issues arise in my schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| and somebody that can immediately address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| My experience with the structure has been very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| Does anybody have any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2115)|
| 0:35:21| Ms. Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| I would just say I think that it was great to hear such positive tones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| and thank you all for being here and thank you for all your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| It seems like this is really helping make such a large district feel smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2130)|

| 0:38:21| Motion by Ms. Horn, a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2306)|
| 0:38:27| I'd like to ask the Law Director some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| I want to be sure that all of us voting regarding this policy have all the relevant information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| and that we are absolutely voting knowingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| And so I want to ask a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| First, is there any change in this policy that would take effect retroactively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2325)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you, Ms. Owens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| I would say that whether we're dealing with a state law or rule regulation policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| whatever a board or a legislature is dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| the only time any of that is retroactive is if there's specific language to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| So in answer to your question, I would say no, it's not retroactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| So hypothetically, if an act were committed while the current policy was in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| that act would be judged based on the policy that was in place at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| and not on any changes that occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| So the answer is yes, and again, that would be true for whatever policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| rule, regulation, or law that you're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| So to say all of that a different way, this policy changes nothing regarding the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| I mean, this change, if approved, would be from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| So to take a little different course here, once this policy is changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| is there anything that could stop me, anything that could legally stop me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| from discussing this policy or the changes that are occurring?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2422)|
| 0:40:28| I'm thinking specifically of the Supreme Court decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| I mean, yeah, and that's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| So are you asking about free speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| I mean, that's what it sounds like to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| I mean, obviously you as an individual, you have the right to free speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| and so if you are identifying your personal opinion, certainly you can express that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| I would say that if we've run into this in the past with the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| once the board votes and passes something, then that's the will of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| and you would not be speaking on behalf of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| unless you indicated that this was the will of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| So I just want to be very clear with everyone that whatever happens here, nothing goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2465)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| So we have a motion by Ms. Horne and a second by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| Do we need to do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Sounds like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| So we'll do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Ms. Christy has requested a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2499)|

| 0:41:54| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Ms. Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Dr. Butler, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| That's five yes votes, one no vote, and two pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2526)|

| 0:43:09| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| Ms. Hillman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| I appreciate the changes that have been made to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| I do still have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| Regarding the procedures, it says that the board and the curriculum supervisors are to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2603)|
| 0:43:36| I appreciate adding the board as the evaluator since that's specifically what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| And then it says that we will use the same internal procedures for evaluation as an acceptance of any new course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2622)|
| 0:43:53| Could someone talk to us about what those normal procedures are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| Dr. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| So I'll echo back to some of the things we talked about the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| So this is a little atypical for the development of a new course in that typically the way that would run for a special course design would be a collaboration between a team of teachers at the school level and the curriculum supervisor at the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2647)|
| 0:44:20| This would be coming from an external source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| So again, we would be looking at establishing a process by which we would collect, I would assume, from the entity, the materials, and the pieces that they are intending to promote as part of that syllabus and assessment plan and all of those pieces that we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2663)|
| 0:44:39| And our supervisors would have to, in a non-judgmental, according to the religious aspect of it, way, make an assumption about the quality and the value of that course in terms of how it's structured and put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2679)|
| 0:44:52| So when the procedure for that is developed, that will be available online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| Yeah, we would definitely want an administrative procedure specific to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| So looking at the licensure question from last time, should it say licensed rather than certified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2705)|
| 0:45:19| Is there a difference there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| My thinking is that the license is the main thing and that the certification is the smaller piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| So the license to teach and then the certification in the specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I'm not 100% sure on the legal term for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| The other term I would throw in there is endorsements that are tied back to specific subject areas and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| I would ask Ms. Himmelgarn, do you know, when we think about the hiring of teachers, is there designated language around licensed versus certified, endorsed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2745)|
| 0:45:55| Would you add any? I don't know the exact differences on those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| Not to put you on the spot, Ms. Himmelgarn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| Yes, certified is licensed by the Department of Education, but certain courses would require certain endorsements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2764)|
| 0:46:13| Does that answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| And the other thing that I don't see, I don't see how many times a person could take each course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2777)|
| 0:46:25| Let's say the example that was used last time is there may be three different levels of a course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2785)|
| 0:46:33| So let's say they took 101, 102, 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| Could they repeat those or would they only be offered once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| So could they only take 101 once or would they be able to take 101 as many times as they wanted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| Some of that is in the nuance between what we, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| and I had a conversation with Bo Stanley who really is very knowledgeable on the internal coding versus the external coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2817)|
| 0:47:03| Some of the nuance is going to be in what we put on our internal coding for a course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| So to your point, we may have an internal code that would be like a 101 and a 102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| which would be two distinct courses and credits and would show up that way internally on a course description or whatever for a school that had students engaging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2834)|
| 0:47:25| What the state course code that that might fall under could be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| and he and I talked a little bit more about that the other day as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| and I think that's a pattern based on what Ms. Horn I think was able to find out that they actually do following Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| There are more, I would say, generic elective codes at the state level that are open for multiple credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| And so as an example, if we were to approach it and treat it more like a literature course, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| it could be labeled that way as a state code for like a transfer course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Currently, we might have a high school as an example that would have, would use that state code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| but offer a Shakespearean literature course, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| And then a student at the high school might have another opportunity for an elective to take, let's say, French literature or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2886)|
| 0:48:12| So those could be reported to the state as two distinct credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| And our books would look at two distinct different classes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| even though the state says you can offer a multitude of things under this code that would meet that bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| And so I'm assuming, again, because there's not a state special course process for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| it's likely we would follow a similar pattern in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| And what we would be approving would be the makeup of that course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2916)|
| 0:48:40| and then determining what the best way to code that for reporting would be internally and externally with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| So the only piece that I still have concern with is the number of credits possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2927)|
| 0:48:59| I would like to see that laid out, how many credits are possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| I think that's something that we should really look at on the front end so that we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| so that we know what we're actually approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| First of all, I wanted to just make sure, because I did not fully understand this on Monday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2967)|
| 0:49:34| but we are not talking about the release time issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| That's already a state law that we have to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| We're talking about the one-hour credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| And that's not something we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| That's what we're deciding to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| The second thing is the process that we would go through once or if this policy is put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=2990)|
| 0:50:02| then there would be the time frame to put all this into place so we'd know exactly what this looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| Right now it doesn't seem like we know what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| For example, we don't know how long it would take for, well, let me go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3013)|
| 0:50:20| So we see that the board is responsible for approval with the curriculum supervisors doing the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3020)|
| 0:50:31| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3031)|
| 0:50:38| I would assume, again, and I'm making this assumption, we're crafting this because we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| We do call out this idea of an MOU and an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| and I would think part of that would probably be to bring a course that has been vetted at that point by those curriculum supervisors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3046)|
| 0:50:55| So at the time we would be agreeing to offer that, I think, with an entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3055)|
| 0:51:00| and drafting the terms of that we would want a course that was being brought and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| this has been vetted by the supervisors and this is the course we're referring to with this MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| or Courses we're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| So if a student wanted to use time release and it's not a credit, we don't have to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3071)|
| 0:51:22| But if it is a credit, we would have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| Okay, so my concern, and obviously my concern would be diminished as we develop the tools to make sure that we protect ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3086)|
| 0:51:40| in terms of if we were to deny someone, say we were to approve an entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3100)|
| 0:51:47| and then we deny an entity, then we have to have some kind of reasoning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| So I think our reasoning has to be very sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| My concern, when you start talking about religious content or denominational affiliation, it's a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3116)|
| 0:52:10| So that's one of my concerns is that fairness, but also what one person may consider religious, another person may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3130)|
| 0:52:28| So we're not evaluating the religious content, denominational affiliation, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3148)|
| 0:52:36| But anyone can bring anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| If the entity that we may be looking at right now is as legitimate as they may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| how do we protect ourselves from those who are illegitimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| And I guess I'm standing here sounding like I'm judging, and I guess I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| But the good news is I'm not judging anything because I don't see anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| But this is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| This can be very muddy, and I'd hate for this to turn into quicksand for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3185)|
| 0:53:11| So I'm still undecided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| I think we put in a number of safeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| We do a very detailed process of this is what the entity has to bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| But if anyone dots all the I's and crosses all the T's, then we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| But, of course, it is parent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| So parent, we do have that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| So I see things in there to safeguard, but I still have that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3218)|
| 0:53:43| And it is a big concern of mine because I don't want, you know, I don't see where we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3223)|
| 0:53:51| since the entity picks the instructor, you know, we're saying that we're given a credit hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3231)|
| 0:54:00| What if the instructor is found to have some kind of sexual misconduct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| I guess are we not responsible because the parent gave permission, but still we're given a credit hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| Those are the kind of things I think about when we don't have that control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| However, once again, we've put in as much as I think we can put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| I don't know if there's anything else we can put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| That was my thoughts on this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you. Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| First thing, I'll just address a comment that was made the other night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| I've referred to this as an entity because it's really a group of parents and there's not a name for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3277)|
| 0:54:43| So I've said entity, but it's a group of parents, so there's not a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| I wrote down some thoughts because I woke up yesterday just thinking about the issue of credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3290)|
| 0:54:57| and the issue of release time weakening a KCS diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3297)|
| 0:55:04| We employ guidance counselors who are able to help students navigate which classes they need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| to complete their requirements for graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| I think that we should allow as much flexibility and diversity within those offerings as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| I think that every school tries to do that for their particular school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| I think the implication that a release time course will be an easy A is really misguided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| In this specific case, and of course, obviously, as Mr. Butler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3334)|
| 0:55:41| there could be different situations with different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| The Campbell County school that we're aware of, in their informal surveys of students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3346)|
| 0:55:56| the kids do not see this as an easy A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3356)|
| 0:55:58| In fact, one student said they weren't going to take the next class because it was too hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| So I think that you can't just assume that it's going to be an easy A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| To that point, I've thought a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| There are multiple classes that we offer in our buildings every day that go beyond math and science and English.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| Some of the most valuable experiences that our students have in classes are classes that they never put pen to paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3380)|
| 0:56:28| and they don't take tests on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Three of those examples would be, and this is just three that I could think of within about 40 seconds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3390)|
| 0:56:36| so I'm sure there are many more, work-based learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Kids go off campus to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| We give grades for physical education, where kids do physical activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| Now, I know some PE teachers give tests, but a lot of them don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| But kids still get grades in that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| We give grades for classes like peer tutoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| where students are assisting special education students in classes or they're showing them how to use a skill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3420)|
| 0:57:09| My daughter, for instance, had three semesters of peer tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| Now, should that have been limited to one semester because she wasn't doing pen and paper work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3434)|
| 0:57:21| In her particular case, I would say no because she is going to college to be able to further work with students because of that experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3441)|
| 0:57:32| So I think all three of these examples of students receiving varied experiences during the school day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3452)|
| 0:57:40| that help provide a robust educational experience and they provide long, positive, long-term impacts for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3460)|
| 0:57:49| So from the conversation around credits that we had on Monday, it sounds like that some of us are saying that these classes shouldn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| So I think that that's a conversation for another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| But to go back to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| So I think we need to be very careful about how we value a class and the assumptions that we make on a class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3485)|
| 0:58:15| As I said on Monday, this issue goes back to students and parents having the right to direct their own educational experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| And if we give A's in the classes that I've just gone through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| then I'm not sure why we wouldn't want to give credit to a class that would include tests and assignments and coursework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3507)|
| 0:58:36| And I think it's very presumptive of us to think that we know what's best for any particular student on what classes they should take and what should be on their transcript.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3516)|
| 0:58:49| I think that's very presumptuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| I think that we can trust our students and our parents to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| We employ a lot of guidance counselors to help them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| And so the bottom line for me is that a lot of these details, this board does not get into the business of details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3540)|
| 0:59:10| We've talked about this a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| That's the staff's job to come up with a procedure that will match the policy and make sure that policy is being followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| The bottom line is that credit for a release time course is allowed by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| And within the requirements, students ought to be able to utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| And regarding the number of classes or courses that students ought to be able to take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3570)|
| 0:59:38| I would caution us on that because just like peer tutoring, I'm not sure if peer tutoring, if there's a limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| But I'm glad that my daughter was able to take three semesters of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| Those were her electives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| So most of our schools are on a block schedule, and there's time for those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| So if a school does not have a block schedule, if they're on a year-long schedule, there may be some additional challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| So I would caution us against jumping into that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| Thank you, Ms. Horne. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| I also appreciate the changes that were made based on the conversation on Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| Mr. Dupler, you had sent me some documentation, I think it was maybe yesterday, related to the House Bill No. 680.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3621)|
| 1:00:30| And we had talked some about if the law is specific about the number of credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| What it says is then a student may be awarded one unit of elective credit for the completion of each release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| So because it uses the word each, to me it would seem to indicate that every release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| So to me that's not ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| Would you read each as each time they complete one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| So what I'm wondering, though, is the policy to me is still ambiguous because it doesn't say each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3661)|
| 1:01:08| It says a course, it doesn't say each course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Does that make sense of what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| So it doesn't really match the language of the law, which I think is part of what our intent has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3673)|
| 1:01:17| I'm sorry, I don't have the policy. That was by memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| Line 31 says for A completed. It doesn't say each completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| I mean, I would say it's the same either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3690)|
| 1:01:41| It's A completed release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| So to me that's not implying that there's only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| That's implying that there's a release time course and credit is then applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| No, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| But the first two times we've talked about this, I've asked the same question each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| And we've said each time it is ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| And what I'm saying is in reading the actual law, I don't think the law is ambiguous to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3720)|
| 1:02:05| And I think the policy could be more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| If our intention is to allow for credit to be given for each release time course, no matter how many it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| I would use the word each instead of A is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| Ms. Warren, I know you're bringing this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Yeah, definitely one credit for each completed release time course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3744)|
| 1:02:33| To me that makes it more clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| That makes people feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Every time that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Yeah, I'd be definitely open to a friendly amendment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| The other thing that's in there is I just want to make sure the board is clear on this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| Because I think some of the public that I've talked to is not clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| That doesn't mean that the board's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| But it says the local board of education may adopt a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| So, Ms. Warren, I appreciate all the comments that you just made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| But even the people who developed this law and got it passed didn't say that every school system in our state should do this or has to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3778)|
| 1:03:09| So I think I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| You're saying, A, we shouldn't be presumptuous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| But I guess what I'm saying is even the people who designed the law are saying we're not going to dictate to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3794)|
| 1:03:21| And I think that's why the conversation has come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| I can tell you if the law said that we have to do this, frankly for me there would have been a lot more conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3804)|
| 1:03:31| Because I'm going to try to draft a policy that's going to try to do what the law is intending for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3811)|
| 1:03:38| That being said, I also mentioned the other night that in 2019 when the release time policy that was presented at that time didn't get passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3818)|
| 1:03:51| that I would have passed that at that time if I was on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| I would have voted in favor of it because I felt like the school district and the administrators needed definition about how to allow people to execute it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3835)|
| 1:04:05| And part of that too, and you referenced it the other night and Dr. Butler has already referenced it tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| part of that is the parent choice argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| It is the idea that a parent should have the ability to let a student leave campus to take an alternative course that's not being funded by Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3852)|
| 1:04:25| And that's, we don't have a policy on it, but it's law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| So to me that's not what we're discussing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| And I don't think that's what the intent of the change of the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| It's really about do we, even if a parent chooses to do that, do we as a school system want to give credit for that course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3874)|
| 1:04:44| To me that has nothing to do with parent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| In that the parents can still choose and a student can still choose and they have been choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| Students have been choosing, I don't know in the high school setting how much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| but I know that there's some early release time situations in Knox County schools that are being utilized at different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| So parents are making that choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| So to me the conversation that we're having is not related about parent choice, it's about do we want to award credit for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| And I appreciate your comments, especially around peer tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| My son, he's graduated now, but he's loved peer tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| That was one of his favorite opportunities and he really excelled in that space and I'm glad that he had that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3916)|
| 1:05:22| And I'm an ordained pastor, I'm not actively practicing like Dr. Butler is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| I have two degrees from a Bible institution and faith is very important to me and it drives most of my decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3928)|
| 1:05:36| In the times that it doesn't, it should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| And I think for anybody of faith that would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| So for me this is not about do I think people should practice or engage and learn about their faith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3944)|
| 1:05:53| because I've been doing that my whole life, that's been my journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| Frankly, because this is something that I did not experience as a high schooler or even in my public education years at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3957)|
| 1:06:06| I'm very up in the air about how much I actually like the idea of it, frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3966)|
| 1:06:14| But to the point that I made to Mr. Triplett a couple weeks ago when we were talking about the freedom schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3974)|
| 1:06:23| I don't know that my personal feeling on it should have much to do with it, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| And so I actually voted for this in first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| I still had questions to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| For me, I appreciate Mr. Dufler, you sending me this because it helps me be more clear on what the intent was that it is each course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=3999)|
| 1:06:47| That was my main question, it's the one I've asked every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| I think I'm inclined to vote for it because, again, although I'm up in the air about, I mean I was a youth minister,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4011)|
| 1:06:58| I know that there's ample opportunity out there for people to get faith-based training outside of a public education school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4018)|
| 1:07:06| And that's probably the thing that's just up in the air for me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| But at the end of the day, I don't know that it should be what, if it's up in the air for me the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4031)|
| 1:07:17| So to me, with the changes of the policy that has been offered, and I think it makes it more clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4037)|
| 1:07:23| and I would offer a friendly amendment to change the language to say each in line 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| then I would be inclined to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Because, again, although I don't think it's necessarily the best thing to do, that's more of a personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4051)|
| 1:07:38| And I would accept your friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| Mr. Triplett, I think you seconded that. You would accept that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| All right. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| I think while we're talking about assumptions, we can't look at whatever course exists right now because any group can bring a course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4075)|
| 1:08:07| So we have to be prepared for any course that could show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| So while we may be looking at a group or considering a group leading into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4094)|
| 1:08:24| we can't assume that other groups will have those same standards, that other groups would have that same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| and I'm going to use the word rigor, we can't assume that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4109)|
| 1:08:34| The difference in this course and the other courses is that all of those other courses are state approved courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4114)|
| 1:08:43| They have all been vetted by both this LEA and the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4123)|
| 1:08:51| Phys Ed has state standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| So when we're looking at comparing one to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| I don't think we can compare a course that we have no real control over content or any piece of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4138)|
| 1:09:08| to one that has state standards that we know we can look at very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4148)|
| 1:09:14| So I think that's important to look at that difference in how they're vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4154)|
| 1:09:19| And I would point out again that based on that licensure piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| it still looks like I would be able to teach a course like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| but the gentleman beside me who are far more qualified would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4172)|
| 1:09:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| Alright, so is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| So we have a motion by Ms. Horne and a second by Mr. Triplett with the friendly amendment to change the language, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4187)|

| 1:18:40| In the spirit of gratitude and for the work of the Collaborative Conferencing Team, I would like to paraphrase the words of an ex-official Knox County Education Association executive board member, former superintendent, the late Ms. Mildred E. Doyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4720)|
| 1:18:57| For the past 12 years, Knox County's educational leaders, teachers, and administrators have worked relentlessly and ceaselessly in the interest of educational support for our students and the profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4737)|
| 1:19:12| Yet you, our Knox County School Board, no less as present Knox County professional educators and school board members have accepted the challenges brought about by present day crises and obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4752)|
| 1:19:27| We are still carrying with us many unsolved educational problems that need solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4767)|
| 1:19:33| With no magic button that can be pushed to solve any of all of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| However, with the continual cooperation, you, the Knox County School Board, and the Knox County Education Association, we can do much through collaborative conferencing to bring about improvements within our profession in all areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4779)|
| 1:19:55| I look forward with anticipation to the next three years and the accomplishments yet to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| And I also wanted to note that when I was giving you all an update, when we started out in this endeavor, our salaries in terms of this ratings was at 44 in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4801)|
| 1:20:15| And the state, we have since then moved to 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| And looking at recent numbers, the state is now at 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4821)|
| 1:20:27| So we are ahead of the state in its rankings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| And so that is from the work of the collaborative conferencing of both our management team and also we have some of our members here with us that represent the executive board of Knox County Education Association as well as the collaborative conferencing team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4830)|

| 1:21:29| And it has come a long, long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| It's very good to hear that the team is working together collaboratively, which is the point of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| Because there was a time when that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| It was a time when the meetings were very, very long with absolutely nothing happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4901)|
| 1:21:47| So it's really good to hear that that has changed significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4911)|

| 1:22:38| But I spoke with Dr. Reiswick and Ms. Coney before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| We would love to figure out a way to get a larger gap between the agenda when the agenda is published and when our meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| You know, 900, 1200 pages is a lot to go through in three or four days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| And I know they're working on some methods to make that a little smoother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| So I'll give them time to get some of that process smoothed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4979)|
| 1:23:03| And then maybe in September we can kind of work towards moving that to maybe like a Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| We get it on Monday and then the next meeting is Monday to give us a little more time to kind of go through that and understand what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4988)|
| 1:23:15| Thank you, Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=4995)|

| 1:24:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230713?start=5042)|
