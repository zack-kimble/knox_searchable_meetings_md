| 4:05:00| I just had a question for director Brooks about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14700)|
| 4:05:03| DKG and DKB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14703)|
| 4:05:07| What is the difference between the two of those my review of it made it look like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14707)|
| 4:05:17| These are both dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| the potential for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| Residential but are we changing away from having a mixed-use approach here where you'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14721)|
| 4:05:27| commercial on the bottom and residential on the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14727)|
| 4:05:33| Amy Brooks Knox Knox County Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14733)|
| 4:05:36| So the difference between the DKB and DKG is that the DKB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14736)|
| 4:05:41| Is called the downtown Knoxville Boulevards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14741)|
| 4:05:44| Subdistrict is intended to accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14744)|
| 4:05:47| Those areas of downtown Knoxville that are developed in a manner characterized by wide planted boulevards and a green open landscape consisting of lawns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14747)|
| 4:05:54| plazas structures at variable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14754)|
| 4:05:58| setbacks, so I think Henley Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14758)|
| 4:06:00| For example on the DKG is the downtown Knoxville grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14760)|
| 4:06:04| Subdistrict and is intended to accommodate areas of downtown that are primarily characterized by traditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14764)|
| 4:06:10| grid network so 300 by 300 approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14770)|
| 4:06:15| And this is to recognize that the central area is likely to be the most intensely developed portion of downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14775)|
| 4:06:21| So in terms of you asked the question about mixed-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| They both allow mixed-use the DKB requires a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14785)|
| 4:06:30| It does not require the first floor to be non-residential use the DKG| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14790)|
| 4:06:38| does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14798)|
| 4:06:40| Okay, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14800)|
| 4:06:43| We're changing from where there would be a requirement for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14803)|
| 4:06:48| Commercial use on the bottom and residential on the top so mixed-use to a model where that's an option, but not required correct, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14808)|
| 4:06:57| All right, thank you for that clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=14817)|

| 4:52:03| shown their true colors. Standing in support of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17523)|

| 4:56:03| pain and their plight. I ask you, do you not feel compelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17763)|
| 4:56:07| to act? Or are you choosing not to see what is being done by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17767)|
| 4:56:12| government of Israel, a government who you have chosen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17772)|
| 4:56:16| to build ties with, despite vocal dissent from your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17776)|

| 4:57:30| as human beings with empathy, demand that Knoxville City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17850)|

| 4:58:58| are sitting on this bench. The second reason I'm here is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17938)|
| 4:59:01| because the people in Palestine don't have a voice. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17941)|
| 4:59:04| muted. They're dying left and right. Kids, women, I don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17944)|
| 4:59:11| to tell you. You're not ignorant. You're not naive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17951)|

| 4:59:17| So I'm going to change the topic just a little bit. I don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17957)|
| 4:59:19| to repeat what these people said because you guys are business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17959)|
| 4:59:22| people. That's why you're on this bench, right, to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17962)|
| 4:59:24| for the city of Knoxville. So let's talk about money, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17964)|
| 4:59:28| $14 billion just got approved to go to Israel, okay? They've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17968)|

| 4:59:38| wrong. 11,200 people have died so far. That's about 1.25 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17978)|
| 4:59:43| people per person. What kind of business does that make? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17983)|
| 4:59:47| stupid, okay? Second, out of that, $14 billion, $5.5 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17987)|
| 4:59:55| went to kill kids. $3.8 billion went to kill women. $4.6 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=17995)|
| 5:00:01| went to kill men. It's not good business. You visited Palestine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-231114?start=18001)|
