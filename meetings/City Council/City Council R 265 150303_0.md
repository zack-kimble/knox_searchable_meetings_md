| 0:02:10| Only the wicked fleeth when no one pursueth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=130)|

| 0:02:31| For the mayor's report, well, at the last council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| I talked about the great job and all the hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| that our departments put into responding to the winter weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| and then we had more winter weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| So I just want to again thank our public service workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| who were out at all hours of the day and night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| brining and salting and plowing roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=169)|
| 0:02:52| and our police and fire personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=172)|
| 0:02:54| whose services and dedication are even more crucial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=174)|
| 0:02:57| during these kinds of weather events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=177)|
| 0:02:59| our operators and managers at CAT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| who kept the buses running on as many routes as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| and in some cases providing the only way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=184)|
| 0:03:06| for some people to get around the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| our 3-1-1 call center, which stayed open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| even when most of our offices in the city county building were closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| and they answered more than 9,400 calls during those two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=194)|
| 0:03:19| and of course to all of our other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| who contributed in various ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| in providing services and information throughout the bad weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| and our KUB employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| who also had to work hard through all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| We appreciate them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| I also heard a lot of, as you have, I am sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| heard a lot of positive remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| about our response from city residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| both in person and via e-mail and social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| The Twitter accounts and Facebook accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=223)|
| 0:03:45| were, you know, really active about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| There were frustrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Obviously there are people who have tucked away on roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| that we can't get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| because we have to focus on the level 1s and 2s most of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| and so we apologize for those that we weren't able to reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=242)|
| 0:04:06| but overall I think it was a pretty good effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| considering the weather that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| and that really speaks to the professionalism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| and the dedication of all of our departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| And I also want to shout out to the communications team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| that really helped keep the messages going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| so we appreciate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Okay, so this week it's going to be a busy weekend for city events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| You all know that this Saturday, March 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| we'll hold our neighborhood conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| from 7.30 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. at the Knoxville Convention Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| David Massey and his staff in the Office of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=278)|
| 0:04:42| have been working very hard for months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| with a lot of other partners to put this together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| and it's going to be a great day to come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| to make connections, and to learn about strengthening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| and energizing our city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| At last count, we had what I heard right before we came in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| was something like close to 670 people registered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| so that's huge, so we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| And I think the registration, it's cut off now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| but if you want more information about the conference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| if you've signed up, go to cityofknoxville.org slash neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| They can register for the program, but they can't get a meal or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| I think is how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=324)|
| 0:05:26| There was a deadline for catering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| Let me ask Becky Wade here, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Yeah, the registration for adults closed today at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| They will still take registration for youth, I believe, until tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=334)|
| 0:05:40| But they can show up on Saturday and register and not get a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| They can attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| They may not get a handout either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| If there are a lot of people that showed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| come on down if you haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| and just know that we may not have enough papers for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| agendas and all, but we certainly want you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| Okay, so then that's on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| And on Sunday, March 8th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| there will be a march and a theatrical celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| to mark the 50th anniversary of the Bloody Sunday March in Selma, Alabama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| that helped spur the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| So we're going to march across the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| So that starts at 2 p.m. on the south side of the Gay Street Bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| We're going to walk across the bridge and then turn right onto Hill Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| and then go on to the Civic Auditorium and the Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| I invite everybody to come and march with us on Sunday beginning at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| And then at 3 p.m. in the Coliseum Ballroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=393)|

| 0:06:39| spoken word performer Black Atticus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| and the Northwest Middle School Choir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| If you want to participate in the march,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| we're asking that people park at the garage at the Coliseum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| and then there will be shuttle buses, free shuttle buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| to get you from the Coliseum over to the south side of the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| where we will be marching from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=418)|

| 0:07:18| from the Urban Land Institute Advisory Panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| that came here in October and met with hundreds of people from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| The public meeting to discuss that report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=445)|
| 0:07:27| and to talk about our next steps and prioritizing our next moves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=447)|

| 0:07:43| for the 19th also that turned out to be spring break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| for UT and Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=466)|

| 0:09:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| So we all got some information from Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Councilman Wallace, you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| So we're going to propose that we amend the budget to include the $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=583)|
| 0:09:53| or cut additional amounts needed for the cart pass that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| We're not approving that cart pass on this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=598)|
| 0:10:00| We're just amending the budget to include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| So I'll make a motion we amend it reflecting to include funding for the municipal golf course fund by $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=604)|
| 0:10:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| And that refers to 11F and G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| That's coming up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| And then we want to amend it and make the motion that we read it on emergency reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| so we can go ahead and approve those when we get it, if we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=627)|
| 0:10:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=628)|

| 0:10:30| So we'll take them one at a time, but first let me see if Councilman Dellavopi, you have questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=630)|
| 0:10:37| Not about his motion, so maybe it's not in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=637)|
| 0:10:39| I was just going to ask Jim, who looked like he was heading for the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| if he could stay for the beginning of the KUB part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| Oh, he's going to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| I thought he was leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| He was getting up to answer your questions, not to dart out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| So first we vote on the amendment, which is to add the $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| Is that right, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| $300,000 additional funding to cover the additional dollars needed for the paving of the golf paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=663)|
| 0:11:11| golf cart paths, which are in 11F and G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| So we had a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| Does that make it $997,000 then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| Is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| The $997,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Let me ask Jim to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| That would bring the total allocation up to $950,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| If you recall, we had previously approved $650,000 in the amendment, I guess, back in October or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=696)|
| 0:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=705)|

| 0:11:55| And now we're on the second amendment, which is to pass this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| So this, we'll only need one, this reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| We won't need a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=721)|

| 0:12:11| We have a motion and second for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=731)|

| 0:14:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Duracap Asphalt Paving Company, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| in an amount not to exceed $513,085 for the Whittle Springs Golf Cart Path Paving Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=879)|
| 0:14:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Yeah, Jim Hagerman is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| I wonder if I could ask him a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=892)|
| 0:14:54| Jim, looking at Item 11F and 11G, since they're both about golf cart paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=894)|
| 0:15:04| I'm just wondering what's the difference between those two in terms of the cost per foot, mile, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=904)|
| 0:15:13| The first one has four miles and is $513,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| The second one has five miles and is $358,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| So it's almost 50% or 60% more for the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| Is there a reason, conditions or something that says why we're spending more per foot to pave the first golf course there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| The five miles and four miles is a little bit misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| The actual length to be paved is closer to four miles for both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=947)|
| 0:15:54| The Whittle Springs width varies and is mostly substandard, so more of it has to be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=954)|
| 0:16:07| You have to dig it up and then rebase it and then pave it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| So it's got more work to prep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| There's also more trees at Whittle Creek and there's some tree preservation that's part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=981)|

| 0:17:10| Councilman Della Vope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Yeah, Bob Wetzel is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Bob, this is a chance for you to, I guess, crow a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| It looks like we have the original site developer undertaking the public area improvements that we're paying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| and you're saving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Maybe you could tell us about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| That's correct on both counts, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| When we put this project to bid, one of the bidders that got involved was a private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1049)|
| 0:17:36| They put this in their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| It's a couple of hundred thousand below what we had budgeted for the project, so we're real pleased to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| It's a very competitive bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| There were three firms that bid, and this one came in very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| The great thing for that is it helps us with the coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| As you all know, the private development is out ahead of us right now, which they often are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| but we're struggling to catch up, and I think we're going to be in good shape by the time they get ready to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| Certainly, we'll be able to work closely with them to get parts of the project done as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| And they can coordinate with themselves without having another contractor to fuss with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| That's exactly right, and coordinate with us because it will be our infrastructure when it's over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| so we've got to make sure we get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1093)|

| 0:18:42| 11-J is a resolution supplementing Resolution No. 1644, adopted by the City Council of the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1122)|
| 0:18:48| on January 4, 1949, entitled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| A Resolution Providing for the Issuance of Electric System Revenue Bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| so as to provide for the issuance of not to exceed $32,250,000 of Electric System Revenue Refunding Bonds Series EE-215-2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1135)|
| 0:19:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| We have Mark Walker here from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| And would you like to give some explanation here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| This and the next three are KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| Sure, just a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| First of all, I'd like to certainly thank the Mayor and members of Council for your consideration of these four resolutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1157)|
| 0:19:25| which in total will authorize KUB to sell approximately $210 million in refunding bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| The purpose of the bonds is to refinance existing debt at lower interest rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| Municipal bond rates are nearing a 50-year low right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| so we have identified the opportunity to refinance several series of bonds that were sold in between 2005 and 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1180)|
| 0:19:49| and effectuate a considerable savings for KUB and our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| Based on current bond market rates, we anticipate we would save $15.2 million over the life of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| The majority of it will be in the wastewater system, as you can see in one of the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| That's $140 million in refunding bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| Just a couple of other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| If approved tonight, we would anticipate trying to go to market sometime later this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| And I also want to point out that these bonds would be secured solely by the revenues of KUB Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| The city would be in no way obligated to repay the bondholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| And also I'm required to mention by state law that we have submitted our refunding plans to the State Comptroller's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| and they have provided a report on each refunding plan, and we've provided all of that information to council in your agenda packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1232)|
| 0:20:39| So I'd be happy to answer any questions about any of the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| Thanks, Mr. Walker, for the general overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1246)|
| 0:20:48| And I love that one sentence that said that the city taxpayers will not be on the hook for any of these bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| These come out of the revenues of the various operating divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| One of the things I was curious about, just trying to add up the numbers that are mentioned in the text describing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| there's about $930 million worth of debt that's still outstanding on these four areas, electric, water, gas, wastewater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1267)|
| 0:21:17| But we're going out for $140 million or $200 million, depending on which number you pick that you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1277)|
| 0:21:24| Are the others below a normal market rate, or why are we only refunding part, I guess, is the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| There's a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| First of all, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| We currently have $835 million in outstanding debt, so these bonds would refinance a little over 20% of what we have outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| But this is actually some of our older debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| In refunding, you have certain call provisions that you put in each bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| so you can only call the bonds at a certain period in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| They're untouchable for a while, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| So none of the other bonds that we have outstanding have reached that point yet where they could be refunded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| and that's the main reason at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| And this is a question for you and or Jim, but I noticed in some of the discussion in the text,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| and I don't have a pinpoint for you, but it talks about the city and KUB obligating themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| and I guess it has to do with who owns the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1335)|
| 0:22:18| Is it municipal equipment or KUB equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| I wanted to go back to that not on the hook thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| You are not on the hook for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| It's worded that way because the bonds are issued in the name of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| It's actually the one seeking the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| Just because the city's name is on it, there are many places throughout the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| the official documents that will say the city and KUB, that really is just a formality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| only because it's issued in the name of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| It in no way creates any liability for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| And it expressly says the latter, which we were just describing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1371)|
| 0:22:54| Is the property that those facilities are on or are part of, are they owned by KUB separate from the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1374)|
| 0:23:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Where's the title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| The title is with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| It is utility system assets owned by KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| I think you've answered my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1391)|

| 0:23:15| Thank you, Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| We have to do each of these by roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| State law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| The bond council requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| And the bond council requires it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Even more important than state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1403)|

| 0:23:49| 11K is a resolution supplementing resolution number R2588 adopted by the City Council of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| the City of Knoxville, Tennessee on February 9th, 1988 entitled, a resolution providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| for the issuance of gas system revenue bonds so as to provide for the issuance of not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1440)|

| 0:24:11| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| It doesn't work anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I burnt out my light bulb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| I'm afraid if that doesn't come on, you're not allowed to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| It's lasting for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| I forgot to ask Mark one question, and that is, since you're putting out a lot of bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| in a world where there are terrible CD rates and stuff, can any individual buy these or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| will these be gobbled up by financial institutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| I mean, in other words, is that available for the local winter woman to put in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| little portfolio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| It is available for individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| And typically what happens is we will sell the bonds to an underwriter, an investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| banking house, and they will have a syndicate behind them, and a syndicate meaning maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| 20 or 30 other investment banking partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| To help finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| And then they will sell out, and it will roll on down to your local markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1496)|
| 0:25:01| But it will be at retail, in other words, for an individual to go to a broker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| It will go to retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| And if you look at our outstanding bonds, I would say, especially in the municipal bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| marketplace, that probably over 50% are actually owned by individual investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| And I know many people here in the city of Knoxville that own our bonds, just individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Some of those are going to be refunded by this issue, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| You are paying something between 4 and 5.5% on the ones you want to refund, and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| trying to get under about 2.5 or 3, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Isn't that where you're shooting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1531)|
| 0:25:33| The bonds that are going to be refunded, the interest rates range on that, but it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| go anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| It will be in the 4 to above 4% range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| And the anticipated rates on the new debt will be anywhere from like 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| And to wastewater, since it's a longer maturity, they will be up to about 3.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| But that might be higher than a half a percent for your local CD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1554)|

| 0:27:47| So it's a big chunk of change that is invested in that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| We have used a lot of debt to help fund the capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| We've already spent over half a billion in wastewater system capital improvements to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| comply with the consent decree going back to 2005, and we'll continue to spend around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| $40 to $50 million per year in the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| When that requirement will end, the 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| The consent decree is due to expire in 2021, but we will continue to replace about 1% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1694)|
| 0:28:22| our system per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Basically, what we're doing now with the consent decree will continue at that rate of replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| So there will continue to be a significant capital expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| This was the bond issue that had the least coverage ratio, like 1.65, which means your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| revenues are only about one and a half times bigger than the cost of the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1717)|
| 0:28:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| Does that make it harder to market these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| We have a AA plus rating from S&P on wastewater and an AA2 rating from Moody's, so it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| very highly rated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| The bonds and the agencies all think the wastewater system is in very strong financial condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| I was just wondering how you foreclosed on wastewater, but I won't ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=1740)|

| 0:33:33| by ordinance numbers 0174-2014 and 0176-2014 as ratified by the voters of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| on November 4th, 2014 and to update the actuarial factors for the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2021)|

| 0:33:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| Okay, Council, this is just so you make sure you understand, these are the supplemental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| plan provisions that we brought to you a couple weeks ago, was it two weeks ago, four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| But without the lifetime annuity for disabled dependents, we did take this back to the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| They voted again to send the entire package to you because that is what the board supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| and what we heard from employees and what we had discussed previously that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| be looking at the disabled dependents as potential qualifier exception for the lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2059)|
| 0:34:28| annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| However, they did so knowing that as mayor, I have the authority to then remove that piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| of it and take the others that had, we believe, general acceptance to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2075)|
| 0:34:40| So the supplemental plan provisions that are before you do not include the lifetime annuity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| for disabled dependents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| I will tell you, though, we're still very interested in that and we are actually setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| up a meeting through our employee benefits department with a retirement planner to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| what are some other options for employees who have disabled dependents and in fact whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2098)|
| 0:35:04| there may be some that are actually better long-term for dependents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| So we are looking into that now and we'll, you know, keep you updated on what we find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Do you want to add anything more to that, Fenbar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| No, I'm sorry, I missed the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| I'm sorry, I missed the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2121)|
| 0:35:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| Well, that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2123)|
| 0:35:24| So anyway, so that's what you're voting on now, the same SPPs and if you have any more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2124)|
| 0:35:31| questions about those that are before you, Kathy A. Slinger is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| I have one because I thought this was only the actuarial factors and it's only one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2135)|
| 0:35:40| the four that we're voting on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| That's the way it's written and that's all the attachments I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| So I'm assuming that there are three others in the wing, two of them that we had preliminary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| looked at and the fourth one with the action, the annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| I haven't looked closely at your packet, but my copy of the First Amendment that the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| has presented has four separate paragraphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| The first one deals with the refund interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| There are also two sections that address the alternative interest crediting rates to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2174)|
| 0:36:22| Plan H hypothetical accounts and the G1 accounts of individuals that are nearing their normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| retirement age and then also the last thing is the update to the actuarial factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| So there are actually four items in that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| The only thing that was removed was the disabled dependent as a beneficiary for that joint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2199)|
| 0:36:48| and survivor annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| That's my error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| As I look at page 628, I guess I see that any reimbursement rate for someone who withdraws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| their money is up to, but not up to, 4 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| It isn't a flat 4 percent, so that's the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| And then the second one is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2227)|
| 0:37:14| The second one is the election for the final year, so that you can put your money into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| a conservative pot instead of having the risk of the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| It would be the same interest rate that we're using for the refund interest rate, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| in general we would expect to be a lower rate of interest than what the fund as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2250)|
| 0:37:36| would earn, but of course it provides some protection if the market should go down like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| it did in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| And then the third one was the factors we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| I appreciate the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2272)|

| 0:38:30| job done, and then the city will reimburse up to a certain amount or however it is, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Joe Wallace, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| We have a certain amount of money in our budget that we appropriate for challenge grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| we call them, where organizations and 501c3s will apply for and be eligible to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| up to 50% of the cost of their program, not to exceed $2,500, and we have about 20 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| those outstanding right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| This is that good looking children's recreation playground thing right in front of the MUSE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| that you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| We worked with the MUSE, they applied for a kaboom grant, they were awarded that back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| in the summer, it was basically installed a brand new playground equivalent to about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| $50,000 and there was a $6,000 match for that, and our grant helped achieve that match amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| Thanks, it's a nice project, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265150303?start=2361)|
