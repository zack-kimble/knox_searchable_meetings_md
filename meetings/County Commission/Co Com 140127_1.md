| 2:58:07| You know, like you said, you're not here to ask us for big raises, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| You're here because you want to teach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| Now, I want to end by asking if I could ask Ms. Hopson a question, if you wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10693)|
| 2:58:19| It's not one of those delving deep questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10699)|
| 2:58:25| No public math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10705)|
| 2:58:26| No, no public math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10706)|
| 2:58:28| But I wanted to ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| You know, you were â€“ I believe you were one of the first to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10710)|
| 2:58:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10714)|
| 2:58:35| And so I followed you on YouTube and have heard, you know, some of the things and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10715)|
| 2:58:40| So I want to thank you for speaking your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10720)|
| 2:58:42| Everyone should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10722)|
| 2:58:46| But I also wanted to ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10726)|
| 2:58:51| Now that the teacher survey is done, and I'm glad the teacher survey was done because we've been talking about it for two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10731)|
| 2:58:57| and we all got bogged down in, well, who's going to design it, who's going to pay for all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10737)|
| 2:59:02| It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10742)|
| 2:59:03| We now know we've got real data to work with, and we know there's some issues out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10743)|
| 2:59:08| We all agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| And I don't believe it's just a teacher issue or a school board issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| It's all of our issues because we're all interested in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10754)|
| 2:59:18| We all want to see improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10758)|
| 2:59:20| So my question for you is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10760)|
| 2:59:22| As we move forward, are you optimistic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10762)|
| 2:59:24| Do you think things are going to get better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| Do you see things on a track to get better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10766)|
| 2:59:29| I know that there are meetings being held, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10769)|
| 2:59:32| And I just want to ask you how you see things moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10772)|
| 2:59:36| I think that things will only get better as long as teachers continue to speak out and speak their truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10776)|
| 2:59:43| I had talked to the school board almost two years ago on the front end of some of this evaluation stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| and absolutely nothing happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| I had gotten no response, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| A couple school board members came down and talked to me after, but other than that, no response at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10793)|
| 2:59:59| So I was completely surprised when there was a response to my address back in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10799)|
| 3:00:04| But those of us, most of us that are here tonight, have really been the ones who have been meeting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10804)|
| 3:00:11| and discussing on issues and showing up at the school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| And as you can see, there are much fewer of us here than there were back in November for the school board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10815)|
| 3:00:21| and that's because of fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| It's because of fear that people will lose their jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10823)|
| 3:00:27| You know, I'm out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10827)|
| 3:00:28| I can't take it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10828)|
| 3:00:29| You know, whatever's going to happen is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| But it's also because these demands that you've heard about are keeping teachers at school late to the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10833)|
| 3:00:41| I'm at school until 6, 7 o'clock, even 8 o'clock, usually on Fridays, just to get the bare minimum done so I can be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10841)|
| 3:00:48| You know, and these teachers behind me are also sacrificing because they could be evaluated tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10848)|
| 3:00:54| And, you know, the amount of time it takes to put into a lesson to meet those expectations that we have now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10854)|
| 3:01:00| you know, we're making sacrifices to come here and let the public know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10860)|
| 3:01:05| hoping that what we have tomorrow will be good enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| And it should be good enough because we are expert educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10868)|
| 3:01:14| But if teachers don't continue to feel like they have a voice, then I really don't have a lot of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10874)|
| 3:01:20| Our teacher work group has been meeting now three different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10880)|
| 3:01:24| and there have been a few changes that have come out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10884)|
| 3:01:27| I'm afraid the public will think, oh, that's awesome, we got all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| But that is just the tip of the iceberg of things that we talked about and discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| and some of the evaluation issues really could have been dealt with much sooner before Christmas break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10895)|
| 3:01:41| so that there are just different issues going on now that shouldn't be happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10901)|
| 3:01:45| if this had been dealt with before Christmas break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| But teachers are going to have to continue to speak up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10907)|
| 3:01:50| and community members are going to have to pay attention and not just listen to the sound bites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10910)|
| 3:01:56| and the spin from the PR people and private interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10916)|
| 3:02:00| They've really got to pay attention and believe their teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10920)|
| 3:02:04| Well, thank you again, and I appreciate your answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10924)|
| 3:02:07| My final comment, Mr. Chairman, is I only have eight months left on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10927)|
| 3:02:12| but I've been very involved in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10932)|
| 3:02:14| I'm hopeful that we can see some concrete things being presented in the next budget cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10934)|
| 3:02:20| so that we will have an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10940)|
| 3:02:21| I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| And so I would like to see us all be able to work together so that we can come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| and start effecting some change because, as we've heard, we need to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10947)|
| 3:02:32| And how we do that is going to be the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10952)|
| 3:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10955)|
| 3:02:36| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10956)|
| 3:02:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10957)|
| 3:02:38| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10958)|
| 3:02:39| Commissioner Smith, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10959)|
| 3:02:40| Commissioners and audience, I've got a 630-speaker engagement I have to do in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10960)|
| 3:02:44| but I just wanted to say, teachers, I really appreciate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10964)|
| 3:02:48| And it was great timing because I'm going to take a lot of this that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10968)|
| 3:02:51| and take it to the workshop or the retreat that we've got coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| I just did a quick calculation on the gentleman talking about the stress level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| and what he's doing to get that $1,500, and I've calculated that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10979)|
| 3:03:03| That's $7.69 a day for a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10983)|
| 3:03:07| And for that much stress, for $7.69 a day, if you get fit, divide it in 39 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10987)|
| 3:03:13| So, anyway, I appreciate you all coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=10996)|
| 3:03:22| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11002)|
| 3:03:23| Probably more than we as commissioners make, but that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11003)|
| 3:03:28| So, you know, as I look at this whole thing, and believe me, there is no voting record, advocacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11008)|
| 3:03:40| there's no bigger supporter on this body than Sam McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11020)|
| 3:03:45| I am a huge supporter of education, teachers, administrators, all the way up the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11025)|
| 3:03:54| My votes show that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| So, with that said, when I hear applause when we said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11036)|
| 3:04:01| I'm only going to approve a zero increase budget, that's damaging to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11041)|
| 3:04:11| I mean, I think we need to look at the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| So there's a lot of emotions in this process, but let's not, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11054)|
| 3:04:20| the whole throw the bums out, throw the system out, that can't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11060)|
| 3:04:24| We can't go backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11064)|
| 3:04:26| So, you know, at my place that I work, we talk about performance evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11066)|
| 3:04:32| I've been dealing with them for 24 years, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| They're kind of new here in this form, but it will change in four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11074)|
| 3:04:39| That's just the nature of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11079)|
| 3:04:41| None of them are perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11081)|
| 3:04:43| There are no perfect evaluation processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11083)|
| 3:04:46| Ours was the one we did this year was flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11086)|
| 3:04:49| I think the superintendent in last week's meeting basically said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11089)|
| 3:04:53| We're going to stop doing some things that we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11093)|
| 3:04:55| You know, some things come from the state, some things come from local,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| and that's probably not going to be the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11099)|
| 3:05:02| But, again, I'm in favor of evaluations, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11102)|
| 3:05:09| I just am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11109)|
| 3:05:10| I mean, you know, I went to some of the toughest schools, most difficult schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11110)|
| 3:05:16| and I represent a lot of the tough schools, tough schools to teach at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11116)|
| 3:05:21| difficult schools, poor-performing schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| So, you know, and I've engaged in that process, not just over the last five, six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11124)|
| 3:05:30| my entire adult life I've been an advocate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11130)|
| 3:05:35| So I see some positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11135)|
| 3:05:38| Sermon Green and Vine needed to be reconstituted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11138)|
| 3:05:41| I supported that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11141)|
| 3:05:42| So I'm not going to come out and say they did it wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| Maybe this solution, maybe this isn't the perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11145)|
| 3:05:47| I don't know administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11147)|
| 3:05:48| We've got to give it time, but something had to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11148)|
| 3:05:51| Similarly, you know, graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11151)|
| 3:05:53| I'm looking at the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11153)|
| 3:05:55| I'm looking at the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11155)|
| 3:05:57| It's not perfect, but we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11157)|
| 3:06:00| I'm not sending anyone out here saying that we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| I just want to let you know where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11162)|
| 3:06:05| So I don't see a revolt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11165)|
| 3:06:07| I see a I'm not happy with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11167)|
| 3:06:10| I don't need you to bring me a new rock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11170)|
| 3:06:13| I need this rock shaped into something that's manageable, that is palatable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| that will work for us, for children, for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| So that's the way I view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| That's the way my support is going to be in terms of moving Knox County forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11183)|
| 3:06:29| So, you know, as I and I, too, have to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11189)|
| 3:06:33| I have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11193)|
| 3:06:34| There's a Walter P. Taylor Holmes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11194)|
| 3:06:37| There's a KCDC's presenting their redevelopment plan for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11197)|
| 3:06:41| I started at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11201)|
| 3:06:42| I have to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11202)|
| 3:06:43| But, you know, as we move this conversation forward, I, too, am looking forward to the retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11203)|
| 3:06:50| Because I think, like I said earlier, we need to bring our heart questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11210)|
| 3:06:54| What are we going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11214)|
| 3:06:55| What changes, you know, are we going to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11215)|
| 3:07:00| I mean, we're going to listen to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11220)|
| 3:07:01| We're going to give input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11221)|
| 3:07:03| Because I agree in terms of what I asked at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11223)|
| 3:07:06| We can make comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| If there's something in the consent agenda we don't like, let's discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11228)|
| 3:07:12| No, we're not going to have a vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| Just these teachers didn't have a vote on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11234)|
| 3:07:18| And they've made a big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11238)|
| 3:07:21| They have effected a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| So our discussion can effect change if we have those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11243)|
| 3:07:30| So I guess I'm just in my bottom line is, you know, I'm encouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11250)|
| 3:07:36| I'm encouraged by this whole effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11256)|
| 3:07:39| You know, I'm encouraged by what the superintendent's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11259)|
| 3:07:42| I'm encouraged by the end results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11262)|
| 3:07:45| Maybe there's too many assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11265)|
| 3:07:46| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11266)|
| 3:07:47| I'm encouraged by our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11267)|
| 3:07:49| They're getting the results they're showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11269)|
| 3:07:51| And they're not coming from superintendent coming to class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11271)|
| 3:07:53| They're coming from you all's efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11273)|
| 3:07:55| So I'm encouraged by this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11275)|
| 3:07:58| I'm encouraged by this dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| And I look forward to continuing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11280)|
| 3:08:04| Commissioner Olvey or Commissioner Briggs there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11284)|
| 3:08:07| Commissioner Olvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11287)|
| 3:08:08| Tony, I was going to let you go last if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11288)|
| 3:08:14| First, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11294)|
| 3:08:15| First, I want to commend the teachers for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11295)|
| 3:08:19| And I'm glad that Tony set this up to give you all a venue to further educate the community on issues that you all see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11299)|
| 3:08:29| You're the experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11309)|
| 3:08:30| You're the ones that's in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11310)|
| 3:08:31| You see what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11311)|
| 3:08:33| You're the ones that need to be telling the story to educate us more on what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11313)|
| 3:08:40| I'm not going to say I'm not going to vote for an increase in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| But I will say that I'm going to look at the budget closer, find out what programs are working, what ones aren't working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11323)|
| 3:08:50| and why are we still funding them, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11330)|
| 3:08:54| Common Core needs to be looked at closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| There's a reason why the mathematician, the math expert that was on that panel that helped start creating this did not endorse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11337)|
| 3:09:07| There's a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| We need to find out why he thinks it is not good for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11349)|
| 3:09:15| I think grants come with strings attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| We need to know what those strings are because when that funding runs out by the federal government in two years, who has to fund it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11358)|
| 3:09:25| Us locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| It comes out of these taxpayers here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11366)|
| 3:09:29| And I want to make sure that if we're going to fund increases in budget, how much of that is going to make it to the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11369)|
| 3:09:37| How much more money are our teachers going to see for not raises but classroom materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11377)|
| 3:09:43| things that they don't have to spend out of their pocket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| And I commend you all for standing up and getting that voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11386)|
| 3:09:51| And Ms. Hobson gets the credit for being the start of it, but I commend you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11391)|
| 3:09:59| And I know it's a great risk that you all took.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11399)|
| 3:10:03| And please continue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11403)|
| 3:10:06| And I hope the citizens of Noss County will look and listen to this meeting and find out what you all had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11406)|
| 3:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11414)|
| 3:10:16| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11416)|
| 3:10:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11419)|
| 3:10:20| I was hoping to get this first part in before Sam left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11420)|
| 3:10:24| You know, I'm a country boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11424)|
| 3:10:29| My wife has a Ph.D. My sister has a Ph.D., both of them in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11429)|
| 3:10:35| My daughter-in-law has a master's in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| My daughter has a master's in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| I know what education is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11439)|
| 3:10:42| I got a Ph.D. from the School of Hard Knocks, but I learned it the hard way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11442)|
| 3:10:49| And I know that you can't take more than two nickels and make more than a dime out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11449)|
| 3:10:56| When I say no to no budget, I mean we're going to be really, really scrutinizing this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11456)|
| 3:11:04| And I'm not doing that to punish you all, and I hope you realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11464)|
| 3:11:09| But I've seen enough going on in the briefcase full of stuff that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11469)|
| 3:11:15| to know that they're blowing enough money over there that they could be doing some of these things in your classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11475)|
| 3:11:22| Put some of the supervisors back into the classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11482)|
| 3:11:25| Let them teach a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11485)|
| 3:11:32| One of you all mentioned, and I can't remember which it was, which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11492)|
| 3:11:35| It might have been Ms. Holtzclaw, about the 163 pages of comments that accompanied the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11495)|
| 3:11:47| How many of you all have read them besides me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11507)|
| 3:11:53| 163 pages, 8 to 20 on a page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11513)|
| 3:12:00| That's a lot of negative comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11520)|
| 3:12:05| Something is not right when you've got that much going on out of 4,000 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11525)|
| 3:12:11| How many of you all have special ed children in your classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11531)|
| 3:12:17| How many of them get pulled out of the best class they have that they're doing the best in to go get the remedial course?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11537)|
| 3:12:28| Now, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11548)|
| 3:12:33| You're only discouraging that child because you're taking away the one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11553)|
| 3:12:38| It may be the only class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11558)|
| 3:12:40| I have a special needs grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11560)|
| 3:12:42| This is close to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11562)|
| 3:12:46| That may be the only class during the day that that child really enjoys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11566)|
| 3:12:49| but because he's behind in math or reading or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11569)|
| 3:12:54| we're going to pull him out of that particular class to go give him tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11574)|
| 3:12:59| Now, that makes about as much sense as putting mud on the side of a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11579)|
| 3:13:04| and saying that's going to keep out the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11584)|
| 3:13:08| Really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11588)|
| 3:13:13| Do the new items just constitute throwing away or throwing you guys a bone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11593)|
| 3:13:19| You know, somebody mentioned a while ago about six, what do you call them, spin doctors, PR people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11599)|
| 3:13:33| You can look at these reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| You give me any set of figures and tell me what you want out of an answer, and I'll figure you a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11615)|
| 3:13:43| You read these reports and say, oh, man, 36% of our teachers say this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11623)|
| 3:13:51| Oh, that's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11631)|
| 3:13:52| What about the other 64% that said it was lousy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11632)|
| 3:13:56| Let's talk about that part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11636)|
| 3:13:59| If I'm going to get a report from the school board, I want it to give me the good, the bad, the ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11639)|
| 3:14:04| Let's be straight with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11644)|
| 3:14:06| If we're going to talk and have a dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11646)|
| 3:14:09| let's cut the BS and get down to the brass tacks of where the water hits the wheel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11649)|
| 3:14:15| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11655)|
| 3:14:21| Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11661)|
| 3:14:22| I was going to let Tony make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11662)|
| 3:14:24| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11664)|
| 3:14:26| I'm having a technological problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11666)|
| 3:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11668)|
| 3:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11669)|
| 3:14:30| I just wanted to say to all the educators who are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11670)|
| 3:14:33| and also to Dr. McIntyre and Lynn Fugate and other people from the central administration who were able to be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11673)|
| 3:14:42| we hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11682)|
| 3:14:44| We feel the emotion underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11684)|
| 3:14:49| My fellow commissioners, the comments that you've made, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11689)|
| 3:14:57| it's obvious that we all care very deeply about our educational system in Knox County and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11697)|
| 3:15:04| I have a second grader and a seventh grader, and this won't be news to anybody who knows me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11704)|
| 3:15:11| I am opposed to the excessive testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11711)|
| 3:15:14| I have been opposed to APEX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11714)|
| 3:15:17| I believe very strongly that our teachers are not being compensated adequately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11717)|
| 3:15:23| But I also want to say that I also trust the process that we're in, and we are moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11723)|
| 3:15:34| I've been working with the Joint Education Task Force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| and I feel like we have gotten from our school board colleagues on that task force, as Commissioner Brown said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11737)|
| 3:15:46| the good, the bad, and the ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11746)|
| 3:15:48| So we are asking hard questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11748)|
| 3:15:52| We are getting straight answers, and we're asking more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11752)|
| 3:15:58| I think right now as we move through this, and this is a process, and this content didn't spring up overnight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11758)|
| 3:16:10| it's not going to go away overnight, but I do have faith in the educators in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11770)|
| 3:16:18| I have faith in all of us that we all want to do what's best, and that's what we're going to move forward together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11778)|
| 3:16:27| One of the things that I'm struck by as I hear the comments made around the table and from the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11787)|
| 3:16:34| and from the teachers at my children's school and from talking with central administration is that this is also a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11794)|
| 3:16:44| where our children are learning from us about how to resolve conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11804)|
| 3:16:50| and how to speak respectfully to and about each other and how to treat one another as human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11810)|
| 3:16:58| and how to value one another for the experiences and the skills that we bring to whatever we're involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11818)|
| 3:17:09| So I want this to be a process that I'm not afraid for my children to be observing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11829)|
| 3:17:21| I want it to be something positive that is a learning experience for them that I can feel good about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11841)|
| 3:17:31| So, again, I said this is going to echo what some of my fellow commissioners said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11851)|
| 3:17:36| that this is coming at a fabulous time for us because we're getting ready to go on this retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11856)|
| 3:17:41| And I think this is a great opportunity for us, and I am very optimistic that, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11861)|
| 3:17:48| we're going to be asking hard questions and there's going to be some really uncomfortable moments on both sides of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11868)|
| 3:17:56| But I think if we can push together through it, then we're going to make some progress for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11876)|
| 3:18:05| And, again, we, you know, I hear the emotion underneath what everyone, the comments that everyone's made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11885)|
| 3:18:14| and I respect what you brought to us tonight, and I'm grateful for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11894)|
| 3:18:21| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11901)|
| 3:18:22| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| I want to take just a minute to compliment the teachers for something that no one's mentioned tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11904)|
| 3:18:30| and because it was you that did this, is the improvement in the scores that we saw in these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11910)|
| 3:18:35| And, I mean, I know everybody tests is a bad word tonight, but the fact of the matter is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| is that the teachers in the state of Tennessee were recognized by the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11919)|
| 3:18:49| Maybe you don't like those people, but they were said they were basically saying that we've had the best teachers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11929)|
| 3:18:55| anywhere in the country in the number of years that they've been giving that standardized test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11935)|
| 3:19:02| And I think that is a compliment to the quality of the teachers that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11942)|
| 3:19:06| Now, what the cost has been, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| I don't know if there's a relationship between the stress and the activities that you've gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11948)|
| 3:19:15| but our students have made unprecedented returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| Now, the reason that's important is that if you do talk to the people who are dealing in business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11958)|
| 3:19:23| that seems to be a bad word, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11963)|
| 3:19:24| But the fact is, is down at Chattanooga, where we have a new Volkswagen plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11964)|
| 3:19:29| they have to take 20 applications to get one person that can work on the assembly line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11969)|
| 3:19:34| because they don't have reading skills and communication skills even satisfactorily to work on an assembly line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11974)|
| 3:19:41| Volkswagen is looking at expanding into building the first SUVs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11981)|
| 3:19:47| They may not come to Tennessee because right now they're having to advertise in Michigan and Missouri| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11987)|
| 3:19:52| to get workers down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| So, you know, we've got to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11994)|
| 3:19:55| I look back just to see what our rankings were a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11995)|
| 3:19:58| and all I can say is thank goodness for Mississippi and Louisiana because otherwise we'd be dead last in our education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=11998)|
| 3:20:06| But to get back to the point I'm trying to make is that I think you really deserve accolades for what the students have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12006)|
| 3:20:14| And like I said, Lead Editorial, New York Times, Lead Editorial, The Wall Street Journal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12014)|
| 3:20:19| basically indicates that we have some of the best teachers, if not the best teachers in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12019)|
| 3:20:28| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12028)|
| 3:20:30| Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| Of course, thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12032)|
| 3:20:36| My original purpose in having or putting this on as a discussion item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12036)|
| 3:20:42| I was hopeful that teachers would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12044)|
| 3:20:45| I didn't know whether you all still had the energy or the stamina to show up again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12045)|
| 3:20:52| like you have so many times at these school board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12052)|
| 3:20:56| There were a few of us that attended the school board meetings that were so dramatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12056)|
| 3:21:04| And Dave Wright and I stood in the back of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12064)|
| 3:21:09| and then I think Ed and I were in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| We were out in the lobby with the rest of you in that other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12071)|
| 3:21:15| And so the purpose is to have my colleagues feel and see what I felt and what I observed from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12075)|
| 3:21:28| And so you did a wonderful job at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| You were articulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12092)|
| 3:21:35| The emotion is undeniable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12095)|
| 3:21:39| And I think my colleagues can feel the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12099)|
| 3:21:44| They hear the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12104)|
| 3:21:46| It's in what you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12106)|
| 3:21:49| This is good for us to take it to this other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12109)|
| 3:21:54| Who knows what will come from the retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12114)|
| 3:21:56| Hopefully good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12116)|
| 3:22:00| There's still much to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| I think that this is really a beginning of some very intense looks in some places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12123)|
| 3:22:12| especially when some of you mentioned money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12132)|
| 3:22:16| That's our domain, money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12136)|
| 3:22:20| So we're just getting started looking at the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12140)|
| 3:22:24| You know, follow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12144)|
| 3:22:27| We need to follow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12147)|
| 3:22:30| And we're going to be about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12150)|
| 3:22:32| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12152)|
| 3:22:39| Again, thanks, everybody, for coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| I do not think there's any more business before this commission, so we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom140127?start=12161)|
