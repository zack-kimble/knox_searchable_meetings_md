| 0:00:00| So basically getting rid of the Office of Neighborhood, all you're doing, those three employees will be switching over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| With the same, they have to be paid so that a dollar amount has to go with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=8)|
| 0:00:12| Well, certainly, and Mr. Rosenberger can address the more budget issues, the budgets that the Office of Neighborhood has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=12)|
| 0:00:20| structurally because essentially the codes office, and let me separate this real quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=20)|
| 0:00:25| what we're talking about are zoning inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| These are trained professionals who deal with zoning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=26)|
| 0:00:31| Typically the complaints that you all bring to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=31)|
| 0:00:33| and these are typically the complaints that come to the Office of Neighborhoods is overgrown lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| dilapidated buildings, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| These are what these inspectors deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| They are actually operationally out of the overall building codes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=42)|
| 0:00:47| They were built into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| So what it costs to actually operate these three individuals from a salary standpoint is about what you'd have to break out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=49)|
| 0:00:55| because they were funded out of the overall budget in the codes office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=55)|
| 0:00:59| So from a budget, how you break down the budget line by line, Mr. Rosenberger can address that more clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=59)|
| 0:01:04| So you would need those dollars back into your budget to pay for those codes officers, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=64)|
| 0:01:09| Well, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| If you take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=70)|
| 0:01:11| And what was that dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| It's $127,803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=75)|
| 0:01:21| And that is in the current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| That's for the three inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=83)|
| 0:01:25| They're in the budget right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=85)|
| 0:01:27| Well, we'd still be saving $220.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=87)|
| 0:01:30| I'm sorry, how much would we save?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| You'll be saving $220 if you move that back into Bruce's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=91)|
| 0:01:35| And, you know, everything that Bruce mentioned there, dirty lots and everything, his department handles it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=95)|
| 0:01:45| That comes in under the highway department to take care of the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| How much did you say those three employees would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| $127.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| $127,803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| What about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| He said $127,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| It would save Knox County $357,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| You take that $127,000, put it back into the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| You're still saving $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=123)|
| 0:02:07| That's still minus that $30,000, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=127)|
| 0:02:10| That's what he was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| I beg your pardon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| I mean $230,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=134)|
| 0:02:18| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| Have you had conversation with anybody in the administration for you to, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=141)|
| 0:02:30| say good things about the office of neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| If they told me to come down here and make these statements, no, sir, I'm making these in my own volition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| I'm down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=157)|
| 0:02:39| You know, Grant Rosenberg actually adds a fourth individual to this department that's clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| clearly been understaffed for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| These are three inspectors that cover this entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=166)|
| 0:02:51| I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| I think the city staff has probably double or triple what this office has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Stop right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| I don't mean to interrupt, but just to get to the point so we can try to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| Mr. Rosenberg, I mean, it doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| Is he a certified code enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Does he know anything about codes and nothing against you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| I know you've done other things in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=194)|
| 0:03:17| Are you asking me this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Well, I asked Bruce or you either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| I mean, I know you said you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| I'm scheduled to be a certified codes inspector along with two of my other officers, Tammy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| and Jackie are also scheduled to take the certification test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| I've been working with Bruce and working with all of our codes officers for the past five years in office neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| It's the number one call we get to our office, probably about 85 percent of our phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| Well, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| I understand, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| But a lot of people that call me about roads, calls me about stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| and I know who to call and take care of it without going through somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| And that's how we've done it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| And it seems like in a year that we need to save money, this is just a good place that really, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| we can still have people answering the telephone and going to somewhere else without it being in the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| And I think that's just a good way to start with this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| And we've got a long ways to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| I mean, we've got some fat in here we need to get rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| Grant, this budget has more than doubled in the last two years since 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=260)|
| 0:04:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| If you include the codes officers, yeah, it probably has doubled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| When you get right down to it, it almost went up quite a bit, even if you take those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| But you requested $218,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=282)|
| 0:04:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| The original request did not include the transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=299)|
| 0:05:00| But, Grant, you were over it at this time, weren't you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| At which time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=304)|
| 0:05:05| When this request was put in for this budget at $218,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| We just went through the transition probably in the last three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| That's not what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| When the original request for the budget was $218,000, did you and Allison, one of you two, put in for that budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=313)|
| 0:05:21| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| So who comes along and decides that the three codes people need to move up into your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| Apparently you had no thought of it, and apparently Allison had no thought of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=333)|
| 0:05:38| Or you would have requested more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| We had a thought of it, absolutely, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Well, you didn't put it into the budget is the reason why I'm saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| The decision was not made until after the requests were put in for the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=345)|
| 0:05:49| Were you told to make this request for those people to come to this office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| You were told to make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| I'm one of the biggest supporters of Office of Neighborhoods, but I looked into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| and I went down and looked at the city's 311 operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=371)|
| 0:06:14| They have a very similar budget, yet they handle considerably more calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| In fact, I think about three times more calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Generally, when I call the Office of Neighborhoods, I always get one person, Crystal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| and she's absolutely amazing, does a great job, and I was shocked when I found out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| I think, what does she make, 20 grand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| That's awful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| That young lady should make a lot more than that based on the job that she's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| But, I mean, it looks to me like, as supportive as I am and as much as I like the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=404)|
| 0:06:51| it just looks to me like we've got one person that's basically duplicating what the city does with 311,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| and down at 311 you've got Russ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| You've got one administrator, and it looks to me like, based on the salaries of yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=420)|
| 0:07:07| and Ms. Wagley, that it just looks to me like we've got some pretty high-paid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| pretty high-level administrators for a department that runs fewer calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| And I'm wondering, what's the justification for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| I think in one meeting Ms. Wagley said that something about that they did some lobbying and for the BEP reform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| and I'm wondering if that's under the Office of Neighborhoods, why is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| And isn't that the job for a lobbyist that's being paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| Let me address a little bit of that, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=459)|
| 0:07:42| And actually, if I could, I'll come back to Commissioner Pinkston's earlier question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| When these discussions started, and they have gone on for some months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| they've been fairly open-ended discussions about how we could take some of these related components| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| and try to bring them under one roof where they might work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| At one time, there was even discussion about moving the Department of Solid Waste out from under Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| and Public Works and putting it in neighborhoods as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| So while it did come together late in the budget process, the discussions have been underway for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| and at one time encompassed other departments as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| The Office of Neighborhoods is more than 215-HELP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| And I think if we should have done anything better, I think we should have communicated to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| that the HELP line is one element of the Office of Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| but by no means is it the Office of Neighborhoods in its entirety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| A whole host of things that go on in the Office of Neighborhoods that don't involve Mr. Rosenberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| but do involve Ms. Wagley are things like PTA roundtables during the school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| where we go to schools within every district, typically with the board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=518)|
| 0:08:43| In cases, we have invited commissioners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| We sit down with the PTA members, with the mayor, Mrs. Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| and we figure out what is going on within that school system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| or even within that little cluster of middle elementary and high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| and how the mayor's office might work better with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| We also work with the urban mayors forum, the mayors of Hamilton, Davidson, Shelby, and Knox counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| on issues that are common to the four urban counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| There are a set of issues in Nashville that are unique to the four urban centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| And we spend a great deal of time working with the mayors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=554)|
| 0:09:17| We've had urban mayors conferences twice, at least once in Knoxville, once in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| We may have had actually two in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=563)|
| 0:09:25| So the Office of Neighborhoods is a much bigger organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| and does a great deal more than just the HELP line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| The HELP line is one part of the Office of Neighborhoods, but by no means is it all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| Commissioner Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=577)|
| 0:09:38| I'm a little bit confused here about the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| One thing, though, that I would like to say in regards to Grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| probably a lot of you remember that a lady came to the podium here very upset out in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=586)|
| 0:09:55| and I believe her name was Charlene Lust, the more that I think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| And anyway, near the line up there, she had a multitude of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| And this just occurred last week, so I'm not prompted here to be a spokesman for Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| But what happened is there was some maybe codes and stuff with the BP station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=610)|
| 0:10:15| also with the dangerous road at Circle Road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=615)|
| 0:10:18| Grant organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| He had the transportation department there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| He had the state people, since it was a state highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| He had the health department there because it was having drain fill issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| But he had about seven people there and coordinated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| And, really, it was a tough situation for a man as young as him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| He certainly handled it with some resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| And we really had an opportunity to help this lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| I also brought out a dangerous intersection, which we're going back with stop signs, stop bars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=647)|
| 0:10:52| which deaths has occurred there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| So, and we spent an hour, hour and a half in the grueling sun, so I know he's out working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=655)|
| 0:11:01| Now, what does that mean in regards to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| And the question here, I don't know, but that was the example that I experienced a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| Also, I guess I was on the receiving end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| I don't know why they didn't get a hold of Craig or Mike, but I think I got the call from Miss Susan, M-A-U-E-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| She has appeared in front of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| Mauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Mauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| And I think she represents 700 homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| And she had responded, and I guess maybe this has been published in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| And evidently they've had a multitude of problems out there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| And she just wanted me to endorse Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| And here again, this maybe doesn't address the problem, but I do know evidently from the 8th District to the West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=696)|
| 0:11:44| at least Grant is visible and very active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| I, too, want to offer my support to the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| Apparently the experience of the Commissioner Lambert and I's constituents there has been different than in the 9th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| because I've heard nothing but good things from the people that live in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| And I know for a fact that Grant and his staff have helped one of my very good friends with a serious zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=730)|
| 0:12:19| a codes issue, not zoning, a codes issue in the Broad Acres subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| And which was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| So I'm very supportive of this organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=747)|
| 0:12:32| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| The same comments as regards to the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| All my encounters with them have been very professional, very swift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| I get nothing but positive comments from my community about the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=763)|
| 0:12:48| Commissioner Abinhorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| Well, I work for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| We have a 311, and I agree they have a great operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| I understand at one time they were talking about putting the 311 and the help together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Is that something, Dwight, that you can talk about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Is that something in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| There's an important distinction we need to draw here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| 311 is a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| It functions very well and it does a good job, but it is a call center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| You call it whether you have a zoning problem or if you want to reserve a park shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=794)|
| 0:13:20| All they do is refer your call to the appropriate agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| 215 is a problem-solving center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| When you call, we'll take ownership of your issue and get you as much help as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| So they're not the same things and they don't do the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| Now, that having been said, we have had some discussions over the years about letting 311 handle the incoming calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| But, again, all they are is a call center, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Somebody still has to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| So there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| But they also make a paper trail in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| They have to answer within 48 hours of what they're going to do about that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Commissioner Harmon, I'd like to weigh in a little bit on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| Mayor Haslam and I have had some conversations about how we can work closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| We had some good situations last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| He and I have, I think, a really fine working relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| You know, we did the skate park together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| We had a joint neighborhood conference, which we put together and had many of you came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| There was a wonderful attendance that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| Other things we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| So, yes, that's going to be something that we look at going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| But they do follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| But our people, I think, are actually a little bit more out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=858)|
| 0:14:20| And that's not a knock to the city because you handle many of those problems in the city yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| So you know what that's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=868)|
| 0:14:31| If you go to page 43 of your book that's right here under expenses, you've got in Grant or Allison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=871)|
| 0:14:42| whoever wants to answer this, you've got $30,000 here for other professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=882)|
| 0:14:51| I think during our budget hearings, told that's a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=891)|
| 0:14:59| That's actually for Pratt and Rice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| They're a strategic counseling firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| They are not lobbyists and they are not registered to lobby in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| They help us at the federal level navigate federal systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| and look for opportunities to get competitive grants and federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| They've been working with us, for instance, on getting funding support for facilities at House Mountain State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=915)|
| 0:15:21| Things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| Allison may have some other examples of projects that Pratt and Rice has worked with us on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| but they are not a lobbying agency and they're not registered lobbyists in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| Well, that was, I believe, what was said during the budget hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| So I'm just trying to find out exactly what this $30,000 is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| So, I mean, is there some examples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| Because if we're not getting our money's worth, I don't see a reason why to keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| Commissioner, I think that figure is or should be $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| I'll ask Allison if she can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| It says in here $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| And then you've got $4,500 on the next page at the top for other services, whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=958)|
| 0:16:07| What is the $4,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| Defer to Mr. Troyer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| I'm told it's postage and printing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| I remember the Office of Neighborhoods does publish the neighborhood handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| And so there are some printing costs associated with the neighborhood handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| And hopefully all of you have had those made available to give to your constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| I've never seen one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| $500 for food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| That's for the mayor's night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| That the mayor's night out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| It would be any number of public meetings, whether it's a PTA meeting or a mayor's night out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| they're even involved in some of the stormwater meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| or they were during the development of the stormwater ordinance, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| Also, they help coordinate the Farmer's Market Steering Committee Redevelopment Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| We had some meal expenses there, just public meetings, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| We've got office supplies and other materials, $200 and $200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| And I guess my question is, is the actual location of the Office of Neighborhoods is right there with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1031)|
| 0:17:21| or at least in proximity on the sixth floor of the mayor's office, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| Or where are you all located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| The staff is on the third floor of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| It's actually on the third floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| We do need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Well, I'm about ready to make a substitute motion because I don't know that we need to pay $30,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| and other professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| And if you think it should be $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| then I'm going to move a substitute motion to cut their other professional services from $30,000 down to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| We have a motion, a substitute motion on the floor to cut other services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:07| What is it, other services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| It's professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| I would like to ask Allison something about this first before we vote on that, if it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Well, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Allison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| I believe that the meeting here, the budget hearing meeting, you said it was $40,000 instead of $30,000 to Pratt & Pratt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| The number that we talked about that day was incorrect, and the correct amount is $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| Twenty or $30,000 now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Twenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Well, in here it says $30,000, and I remember the $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| I'm getting all kinds of figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| That's what I keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| How can we vote on a budget when we don't have the correct figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| But here's what I want to ask you, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| This Pratt & Pratt, is that Olly Pratt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| That's your former boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Allison, the rumor is going around that you've turned in a two-week notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| I have not turned in a notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| You're going to be with us then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| As far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| You tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Anyway, now it's down to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| I'm going to defer to John Troyer and let him answer that question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| The number in the budget book is $30,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| That's what's been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| And there's been since discussions to reduce the contract for Pratt & Rice down to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| And the mayor's office is comfortable to accept Commissioner Leuthold's recommendation to reduce it to $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| Mr. Leuthold, I would like for you to rescind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Cut it completely out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| This looks like a conflict of interest to me here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| Well, and it might be, but it might be that we need to have someone in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| If we're getting more money in than what we're paying, then it might be worth doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| And I guess, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| How much in grant money could you say is directly attributed to having a firm like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1208)|
| 0:20:18| At least it was Pratt & Rice right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| How much can you say they actually brought in for our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:27| I mean, we paid them some amount of money last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| Did they bring back what we paid them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Did they bring back two, three, six, ten times what we paid them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| What would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| Are we getting our money's worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| I would say that, yes, we are getting our money's worth on several different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| I mean, Molly Pratt helped us with the money for Moreland Heights when she was chair on the Art Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1246)|
| 0:20:54| which has helped bring their test scores up dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| And how much was that worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| The arts integrated school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Do you have a dollar figure on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| I can give that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Not off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| I mean, are we talking a few thousand dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| Are we talking tens of thousands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| That was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Just an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| You know, I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| You know, any good grant writer is going to get many, several times what they get paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1278)|
| 0:21:27| So, I don't even know if they're doing a good job or not a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| They've helped with House Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| They're looking at money for Seven Islands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| They're looking at money for Water Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| They may go after three or four different grants, and we may only get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| But Seven Islands is how much, millions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| How much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| A couple hundred thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| So, yeah, I'd say we're getting our money's worth from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| And it's not just writing the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| It's actually knowing that the money is there and that we have an opportunity to try and get that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1317)|
| 0:22:08| Well, I guess, you know, Commissioner Pinkston brings up a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| You know, she used to be an employee of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Was she not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| She was their boss, she said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| And I guess my point is, is that who approves of the contract for who we use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:28| I would make the point, Commissioner, when we went into contract with Pratt, Pratt & Rice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| the supervision of that contract originally was not with Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| It was with Cynthia Finch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| And it was subsequently moved to Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| So at the time this contract was executed, Allison was not involved in the negotiations of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| nor was she involved in the supervision of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Well, I guess I'll, you know, if they're doing a good job, then I think we can keep the 20,000 in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1370)|
| 0:23:00| But I think that, you know, possibly putting it out to bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| or at least letting us, the commission, vote on who gets that contract, I think, would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:12| We're perfectly comfortable with that, if that's a decision you all make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| Mr. Pinkston, would that be fine with you if we put it out for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| We can put it out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| But I guess my substitute motion is reduce on that particular line item the 30 down to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1404)|
| 0:23:32| If there's no objection, I'll just take that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:37| I object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| You object to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Then we'll put it up for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| So you have a substitute motion to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Substitute motion to reduce the office of neighborhoods from under other professional services from 30,000 to 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:54| You have something on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| Did someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1436)|

| 0:24:00| Before we vote on that, I'd like to ask Dwight something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| I want to say something else about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| Do you have something on the substitute motion, Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Do you have something on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| Dwight, what is your job with Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| The chief administrative officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| You were in public relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Does it still fall in under you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| It's a part-time function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| We have a full-time staff person that does it every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Who is this person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| That is Suzanne Dukes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Suzanne Dukes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| I think it's probably about 20 or 25 percent of my time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| Well, looking at this resume here of office of neighborhoods, you know, where they set up all these functions for the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| and things like that, it looks to me like that would fall in under her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| If she's a PR person, you know, to work with the PTA groups and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| Why is this in under the office of neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| It's outreach and relationship building with the community and constituent service, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| It's not the same thing as dealing with broadcast media, print media, writing news releases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| Mrs. Dukes sends a newsletter out once a week to subscribers that come through our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| She sends out on alternate weeks a newsletter to employees of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| She authors news releases, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| She handles requests from the press corps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| On the other hand, the office of neighborhoods is organizing meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| having an interaction with the PTA, handling neighborhood complaints and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| They really are two separate functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| They work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| They really are two separate functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Now, you said she took 25 percent of your workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| She took more like 75 percent of my work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| I misunderstood you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| As far as communications, I've picked up other responsibilities from administrative responsibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| to for the last year dealing with the audits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| What is her salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| I'll infer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| We'll roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Am I going to get a chance to talk or are we going to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Well, I came to you and you said you didn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Mr. Pinkston went ahead, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| I went to you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:03| I never got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| I don't think I got recognized, but if you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| No, you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| Well, you know, what's the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| I know what substitute motion was, but was the motion to cut out the office of neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| and to send the one employee to engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:25| I guess that would be the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| But I made a substitute motion that only takes out the $10,000 out of that professional services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| I want to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| I mean, we've got Senator Alexander and Senator Corker and Congressman Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| I mean, they've got a staffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| Are they not looking to help bring money back to this district, their district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| that we have to pay other people to go up there and try to find stuff and then go to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:54| They're very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| I'd point out that Dean Rice of Pratt & Rice is a former staff person for Senator Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| and I believe has worked for Representative Duncan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| So it's those kind of relationships that help us get to Washington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| identify where funding might be available, and then work to bring those funds back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| And we could hire a hundred more people that could have been associated with political people before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| and we could say they're doing the same things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| But at some point, I think there's people in this government, high officials as yourself, the chief of staff of the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:30| department heads, that can do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| I mean, we keep adding people, adding people, and everybody acts like they're so busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| And they keep adding people and adding people, but they're really busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| I'm going to vote against this because I think it's, if you're only going to cut $10,000, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| we might as well leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Mr. Moore, let me say something about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1672)|

| 0:27:58| and asked them if they had any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| I talked to Bobby Griffiths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| He said, we most certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| And I said, could you get us some money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| He got us $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| I didn't get a penny for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| You know, we've been here since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1690)|

| 0:29:34| That was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Mr. Chair, would you recognize the need for a break, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| I'd like to get through the last one that Commissioner Pinkston asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| I've got about three more here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Is it three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1788)|
| 0:29:50| Well, you all want to take a break now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| We've already done one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| I think we eliminated one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| We've already done one, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Let's get through these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1798)|
| 0:29:59| These won't take long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| That's what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| If the sevens eliminate one lobbyist's position, all savings unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| I can't find out what they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| About one would be about $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| I didn't know either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| I wouldn't have voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| Two together is $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| So one's $40,000, one's $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| Who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| John, who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| They're Joe May and Chuck Welch with the firm of Harlan Matthews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| Okay, both of them is $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Was that bid or done on a professional service contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| It was done on a professional service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Mr. Law Director, is a lobbyist professional service contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| Is that professional service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| No, I don't believe it meets the definition of what a professional service is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Anyone can be a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| You don't have to have a certain degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:57| You don't have to have certain expertise, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| And that's what the statute requires for professional service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| I want to make a substitute motion that we eliminate both those positions and save $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| We have a substitute motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| I just want to say I agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| We've got commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| We've got the mayor and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| Why can't we just run to Nashville and lobby when we need a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| I'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| We've got our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| Let me address that in two-fold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| First, with all respect to our general counsel, we've checked with David Seavers and CTAS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:45| and David Seavers implies that lobbyists are a certification and that lobbyists can be bid as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1905)|
| 0:31:54| or can be selected as professional consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| We just did receive this opinion, I think, within the last two weeks from the law director that said this in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1917)|
| 0:32:05| should be put out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| So this wasn't like something five years ago when we didn't have that opinion five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| I think we received it from Ms. Stackhouse within the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:21| The contract we have in place now goes to February of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| Well, just for the other commissioners about the lobbyists and who they work for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| we've had this conversation about a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| And, you know, we can go back to where you wanted to, the administration wanted to take the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1952)|
| 0:32:38| and make it as a risery board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| You all went to Nashville with your lobbyists and had the law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1960)|
| 0:32:44| This commission talked about the E9-1 board members' appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1964)|
| 0:32:48| They were commission appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| This administration disagreed with that and thought they should be theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| And I said at the commission meeting we would postpone it 30 days if you all didn't go to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| and get the law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| You all took Joe May, went down there, had the law changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:02| It's the next month at the meeting of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| It didn't matter what we did because they were the mayor's appointments at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| So I don't think you can get any law changed in Nashville in one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Well, you certainly didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1992)|
| 0:33:13| We may have had an interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| But speaking of 9-1-1, that's a good example of lobbying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=1995)|
| 0:33:20| Last year we saw a declining revenue stream in our 9-1-1 center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2000)|
| 0:33:27| and that was a direct result of one simple thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| Everyone was using cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| No one was using hard lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2012)|
| 0:33:34| And we all made phone calls, Mr. Orms, to go to Nashville, and we all lobbied it to get it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| And I think we can do that without paying people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| But once again, once again, you all haven't followed the rules because it is not a professional service contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| Well, just along those same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| So, John, if this motion fails, what happens as far as so in February this would go out for open bid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2033)|
| 0:34:05| without any other action on our part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| Is that what will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| It may be sooner than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| So we will potentially void the contract and re-bid the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| We're talking about next year's monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| You know, the contracts, correct me if I'm wrong, Mike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| but the contracts as we exist right now have already been made, monies earned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2063)|
| 0:34:31| We're talking about next year's monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| And I was thinking the one, you know, I've looked at so many documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| I thought the one we had with Mr. Welch was a January start date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| And the way it read, it was renewed every year annually unless someone canceled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| So I would assume the one that was renewed last January 1 will be in effect until January 1 of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| If there's no money for it, it will be canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| I understand the substitute motion is to do away with the two positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| Commissioner Ivan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| I guess my question is to Mike Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| Do they answer to the mayor's office or commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| or how they get their instructions on what to work on in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| You know, they get instructions from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| but I think on many occasions we've asked commissioners if there's any needs that commissioners have for lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2115)|
| 0:35:25| We've even had requests, for instance, last year from a member of the zoo board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| When the zoo was trying to get some special funding for the zoo last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| lobbyists could help walk the way through and make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| Now, keep in mind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| I know our county commission meetings are frequent and hectic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| but in Nashville you'll have state and local government, finance committee, education committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| meeting simultaneously both in a house and in a senate four days a week for the whole session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| And going back to the previous administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| I think Ms. Molly Pratt did spend every Monday through Thursday in Nashville full time trying to work those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2164)|
| 0:36:14| Going back to Mr. Moore's comment on the 9-1-1 board, we were the ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| the mayor's office identified the lack of the funding stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| And if you want to ask Bob Coker to come and testify on how that worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| we did ask for people to call the state representatives and state senators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| But our lobbyists and I personally met on numerous occasions with the 9-1-1 board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| and with Lee Quistale convincing them to designate some of the cell phone revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| that the state completely controlled back to our local 9-1-1 board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| And we received over $900,000 of funding for our 9-1-1 board last year, and that's ongoing funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| And to explain, I was asked for examples of the real money that came to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2213)|
| 0:37:02| I'd like just to comment on the 9-1-1 board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I know Bob Coker spent several trips in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| I don't know whether he's working with the lobbyists or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| I wasn't aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| I know he went and some other people went with him to the 9-1-1 board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| And they did recover $900,000, which helped the 9-1-1 board stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:23| Hey, Mike, was this only for Knox County or was this a statewide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| We went after it for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| No, but did it pass statewide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Should other 90-something counties be thanking us or giving us some money for passing this thing if it helped them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| Well, that's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| This wasn't a law that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| It's just for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| This was a change of policy by the state 9-1-1 board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| Make cell phone people pay, collect and pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| The cell phone people always paid their cell phone fees, but the state's 9-1-1 board kept all that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| and decided what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2278)|
| 0:37:59| Our argument was this, that locally the 9-1-1 calls coming in to our center were exponentially rising because of cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:09| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I don't mean to cut you off, but is this something that just had the legislature or the 9-1-1 board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2290)|
| 0:38:15| state board approved just for Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| I don't know if they approved for other counties, but I'm going to tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| We were the county that brought it to their attention, and we were the county that went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| Our county alone went down first and brought this to their attention with our lobbyists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| and met with Lynn Quistel on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| When you all meet with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| That's what I hope we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| I hope we cut it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| All counties got percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Can I make one other statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| Just like BEP reform, all counties got advantages to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| but this was a county that identified the fact that the big four counties weren't being appropriately funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| through the BEP formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| It went through BEP reform, and all counties benefited from that, not just this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| In effect, this county was a leader both in the 9-1-1 reform and the BEP reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2346)|
| 0:39:10| And you can talk to Lynn Quistel, the executive director, or you can talk to Governor Bredesen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:15| Okay, Mike, we need to move on, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| I'm identifying dollars that came as a result of lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| Nineteen million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Mike, let me ask you a question while you're still up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Does Hamilton County have someone in Nashville representing their interests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| I'm not sure I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| I know they have a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| What about Shelby County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| Shelby County may have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| And I know Davidson County is right there, but what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to get a feel for knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2376)|
| 0:39:41| and being in Nashville many times, the hecticness is one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| but it's very easy to slip things onto bills and tack things onto bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| I imagine that part of their responsibility is to watch legislation that's going through to make sure that something's not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| slipped in that's going to have an adverse effect on Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| That's why I'm asking if we don't have anyone there, do other counties have people there representing their interests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| Yes, they do, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| And it's primarily the larger counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| And here's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| Someone asked this question a little while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| I spent 16 years in private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| I believe in return on investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| This is a great return on our investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| You don't have to look very far to see where they've brought us money and also where they've saved us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| And it has to be watched every single day because something happens down there that gets away from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| And we've got a very good legislative delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| Commissioner Moore is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| Lots of people help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| But you've got to have somebody on the ground there constantly to make sure it works to our benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| And we probably, when we look at what's gone on in Washington, applaud Commissioner Pinkston for his role in getting the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| for the senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| That's really made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| But we probably could be doing a better job there bringing additional dollars in when we know things are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| Federal budgets are huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| And as good as our congressmen and senators are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| sometimes they don't know where different pockets of money are available that we can go out and get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| And that's what we're trying to do in each and every case to relieve pressures off this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| So if we keep this in, it will be bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| This would be a bid situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| My understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2473)|

| 0:41:16| All for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| We've got a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| First district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2483)|

| 0:41:47| Commissioner Luthold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2507)|

| 0:41:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2511)|
| 0:41:52| Commissioner Roundtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2515)|

| 0:42:10| Can you clarify what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| Stopping debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| Shut off debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2534)|

| 0:42:18| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2538)|

| 0:42:26| Takes two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| A simple majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Two-thirds for a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| It's not a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| Nine-nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Commissioner Ivan Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Well, you cut my discussion off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| I'm getting confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| I guess this question is for the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| If you had a choice, mayor, would you pick one of the two that we have and could one do what two does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| work twice as hard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| Commissioner, going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| Oh, that's putting you in a hard spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| No, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Going forward, what we're going to do is look at reducing this number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| What I told Commissioner Briggs and each of you earlier, we will not be spending this full amount of money this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| We're going to be trying to reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| But when we go out and look at a bid proposal, we just don't know where it's going to be, so we're going to make some reductions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| As we go out for a bid, it's going to be incumbent to see who comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| And, again, I've spent 16 years in private business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| I believe in return on investment, and this is a good return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| I'd just like to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| I know Joe May has worked hard for our county and our community, and I don't know the other guy, but I know he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:39| I just wanted to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2619)|
| 0:43:40| I know that legislative session is only in during a specific time during the year, not the entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| So does the contract cover the entire year or just during legislative session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| Commissioner, we spread it over the entire year because we use them at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| As Mr. Arms was mentioning earlier, the 9-1-1 funding had really nothing to do with the legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2634)|
| 0:44:00| And a lot of the groundwork we're plowing right now for next year's legislative session is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2640)|
| 0:44:05| while the session is not in Nashville, visiting with legislators and the governor and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| So we spread it over 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| Okay, but the legislators are not there in Nashville when they're out of session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:19| They're usually maybe once a week or something, but they're usually back home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| That's the whole point of having sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| But the lobbyists also work with commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| They are commissioners of economic development, commissioners of revenue, tourism, and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| It's not just the legislators that they're assisting us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| And that's really a good time to work with those individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| We made some of our biggest headway on BEP reform when the session wasn't even going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| and trying to convince the governor, the commissioner of revenue, the commissioner of finance and administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| and others to help us with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Commissioner Luthell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Commissioner Moore, your motion is to cut out both lobbyists, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| My motion is to cut out the $90,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| And I believe Commissioner Pinkston was just wanting to half that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| Is that what you were, your original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| I second his motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| But you originally just was going for half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| One position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| I didn't know what they were making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| That's the reason why I called for the elimination of one position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| But I second Mr. Moore's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Well, I'm going to make a substitute motion that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Mine is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| That is a substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| I didn't realize that's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:33| I made a motion to cut it in half, and then he made a substitute motion to cut all funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2733)|
| 0:45:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Was that a since did Paul make the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| And then he seconded yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:49| Wouldn't that be a friendly amendment rather than a completely different motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| He could have done it that way, but he did it as a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| I didn't have a second on mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Well, if you didn't have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| We have a substitute motion on the floor, and we're getting ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Anyone else have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I'm going to vote against the substitute motion so we can get back to the original motion, which was to cut it in half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| I'm sure everybody will vote against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=2771)|

| 0:52:50| Yes, that was, that was, well, we have not voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| That will be when we get back to the higher vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| I understand, so I'm going to bypass this is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| I followed your lead on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| He only added $25,000, though, didn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| But that just right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| Don't know the full $50,000, but just half of it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| Half of it for the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| So that's a 229,000 or so savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| The reason why I'm asking you that, my understanding of the vote that we just took on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3192)|
| 0:53:18| Office of Neighborhoods, two of the people misunderstood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| They thought we were just voting for the $10,000 cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| We can get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Well, we've only so far out of Office of Neighborhoods we've only eliminated the $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| But, you know, my amendment was to get rid of the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3211)|
| 0:53:36| And they said that's what they thought they were voting for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3218)|
| 0:53:39| You had a motion to eliminate the entire office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| I had a substitute motion to only eliminate that $10,000 out of that one line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| The last motion that we took was to eliminate one lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| So it was $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| But the reason why I brought this up, I had two commissioners tell me on that one they thought they were just voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| They didn't know they were voting not to keep the Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| But anyway, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| Number nine is no new positions established for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| I've got cost savings unknown, but my colleague has checked this up and I'll let her tell you the amount of savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3250)|
| 0:54:18| this will save Knox County if we don't have any new positions for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:26| I handed this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| It was a fax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| You should have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| It was distributed way early this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| It may have really gotten lost in the shuffle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| But it was a three-page document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| And it was just notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| And what I did is in the detailed budget, I did a search for new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:47| And there was a significant number of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| And I tabulated just from the top down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| I didn't go through all of them, but I got down to the records management unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| And if my estimates are correct, if we would eliminate and just withhold any new positions for the next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| I would say roughly a two million savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| And I haven't even gotten through all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| Commissioners, in your books, there's a schedule of new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| And I'll just run through them real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| What were in the book?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| I'll go ahead and second the motion to allow discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Anyway, it's, you know, a million, 262, 448.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| What page is it, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Or is it just scattered throughout, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Maybe I'm the only one that has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:54| But let me just go through this and we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| The first right off the bat is three with the inspector general, which Commissioner Luthold has already addressed in his original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:06| We've got three with juvenile court, which Judge Irwin talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| We've got a 4D referee, which Judge Irwin talked about, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Three positions in juvenile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| One position in juvenile court to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| And we've got two positions in juvenile service center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| We've got one position in law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| We've got one, two, three, four, five positions in parks and rec to open up Shumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:33| One position in community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| One position for the Carter Senior Center opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| One plan examiner in codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:43| We've got two in the medical examiner's office and two stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| And the number is $908,000 for salaries, 353.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| For benefits, for $1,262,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Benefits was how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| $353,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| And $900,000 and something for salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Now, why were some of these, because when I did the search in the detailed sum, not in just this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| but in the detailed budget that you have online, why is it that some of these, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3428)|
| 0:57:16| the attorney general's office, they had new positions and steps benefits at $220,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| Is that to hold something open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:23| Because that was recurrent throughout the whole document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| Jury commission, new positions, $70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| I think that's talking about raises that would be within the attorney general's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3450)|
| 0:57:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| And then what about, but to me, still some of these don't match up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| Because when I did this search, it seemed a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| There was a lot more than what appeared in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| Yeah, it's a short list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| I mean, there's not much there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| And, of course, in the mayor's budget, we've proposed a six-month hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| These positions are there in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| I think they're all important, even the inspector general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| But Commissioner Leuthold has made that a part of, taking this out, a part of his original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| And one thing that I think hasn't been a part of this general discussion is Frances Fogerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:26| I think I would like her to discuss her proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| She's got some proposed policy on how to actually implement the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| And so I think that would be a good topic of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| Frances, will you come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| John, before Frances comes down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| why does Ms. DeFries have more jobs than what you have in the book here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3526)|
| 0:58:57| It's steps to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| You do have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| New positions and steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| So it's including raises as well as new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| New positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| You've got to look at new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Zero, zero, zero, zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3552)|
| 0:59:13| For instance, and I've got a couple of examples, like, for instance, the election workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| We put those under new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| But those are really just to run the elections that the Election Commission does because they're not permanent employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| just part-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:29| And so they're in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| And so full-time employees is a shorter list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| So you're saying, then, that part-time employment is not mentioned here at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| Is that correct, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Like, for instance, the Election Commission is going to run an election in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| They're going to run an election in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| And so those election workers are going to show up as new positions in the detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| But in reality, they're just seasonal one-time events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| So where are they in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| The election office has a total of over 650,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| So where is that reflective in this booklet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| That's part of the Election Commission's budget for the new year to be able to run those elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| Commissioner Malbert, did you have some more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| I just wondered if you wanted a few words about the hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Positions that were publicly advertised prior to May 14th could go through completion to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:56| But anything that was not publicly advertised by May 14th is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3656)|
| 1:01:04| If you have a vacancy, if a vacancy occurs, it's possible to take an existing employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| and transfer them to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| But downstream, you're going to have an unfilled vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| You know, we'll look at other scenarios for critical positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| It might be possible to hire a temp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| But essentially, the intent is to leave a position vacant unless you can do an internal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| Frances, I believe this says no new positions, not a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:36| This was made clear that anybody that retires or leaves, that can be replaced, but no new position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| You're talking about creating a position that we do not have a job code for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| That's a different situation, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| So I think every single one of these positions are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3710)|
| 1:01:55| So anyway, that's just our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| And for example, even in the juvenile court clerk, in this booklet that we have, there are zero mentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3718)|
| 1:02:08| So you're saying that the full-time employees would be 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3731)|
| 1:02:12| Am I reading this right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| Proposed fiscal year 2009 full-time would be 11 new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| In this booklet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| I'm on page number 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| I don't have that in front of me, but there's not that many new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3747)|
| 1:02:32| 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Yeah, page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3753)|
| 1:02:44| And that is unit 2710.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3764)|
| 1:02:51| And when I went and did this search in the detailed budget, that accounted for about $37,000 worth of new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3771)|
| 1:03:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:05| What I'm looking at on that page, there's 11 positions presently and 11 positions proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| So there wouldn't be any new positions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| And why is there a line item for new position then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| That's the salary increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| So those 11 people would get that much salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| Okay, but wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| There's a 9199 new position and steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Is that the steps increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| And then there's a different line item for benefits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3805)|
| 1:04:00| Overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| I don't know if we've hired some here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:11| Yeah, that amount that's new positions and step is the raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| The raise plus the step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| Two percent plus the step for those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| There's no new positions in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| So you're saying that that is raises then that accounts for the $37,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| And how many people would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| I see 11 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:33| Over the 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| John, I'm just trying to get a figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Are we talking about new positions or are we talking about positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3885)|
| 1:04:50| No new positions created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Commissioner Pinkston is proposing no new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| And I'm proposing that there are some new positions that would be vacant for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3896)|
| 1:05:02| What's the total number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| A million two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| No, no, of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| I just read the list to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Yeah, you read it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| I've got three, three, four, three, one, and I don't have the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3911)|
| 1:05:26| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| He's, he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| That's 23 total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| And that includes three for the inspector generals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| And how many people, was it last year or the year before we turned over John Tarleton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3946)|
| 1:05:52| How many positions did we let go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| That's been a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| A number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3957)|
| 1:05:58| But I was on commission, so it's been less than five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| It was like 100, 100 positions or something, maybe more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| Yeah, I think that was 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| What about last year, I think, when we did the health department for the injured care people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| sending them to contracted services out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| And we done away with several people at the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| That was last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| But what we're talking about is this proposal for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| Well, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| But we talk about that we're cutting, you know, I hear it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| We've got less employees now than we did when I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| And if you go back and look in 2007, we got 1,664.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| The next year we go 1,675.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| The next year we go 1,711.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| And this year, if you add 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4012)|
| 1:07:00| Commissioner Moore, the 1,711 is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| But this year you're talking about 1,717.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| We're continuing to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| After a couple of years, I know we put 20 or 30 from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| I know John Tarleton was over 100 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:26| And it's what I said a minute ago, we keep creeping back up with employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| but we're out here telling the citizens we have fewer people today than we did in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| And I'm just trying to figure out if that's the case or we've got more employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4055)|
| 1:07:51| You know, I think what we're here to talk about today is what this budget proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| and I think every single one of these positions that are proposed are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| I think they make sense for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| I heard Judge Irwin talk about the need in his court to decrease how much time it takes for him to be able to hear custody hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4082)|
| 1:08:10| You heard the incoming law director make the case for a new person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4090)|
| 1:08:15| You heard Doug Battelle talk about opening up Shumpert Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| and the need for maintenance employees in Shumpert Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| You heard the clerk's office talk about the need for help to administer the people in Judge Irwin's court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4102)|
| 1:08:31| I understand what you're saying, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| I go back to what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| We've got a new senior center in Carter opening up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| One position is not unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| You know, we've got code plans examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| We want to keep that backlog as low as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| Stormwater, we have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| We don't have a choice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| So I think all of these are very, very reasonable, and we're still proposing a hiring freeze for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| But this number does not include other offices that you cannot control if they hire someone or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4137)|
| 1:09:07| Yeah, we have a number of fee offices that are not budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| So the number could be higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| And, you know, like I said a minute ago, these things are great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4153)|
| 1:09:17| If we can afford them, I mean, we could hire a lot more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| We could do even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| We've got to decide what point is enough to carry out the essential duties of what government should do for its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4163)|
| 1:09:32| You know, you just hear on TV this morning, C-Ray, laying off 1,400 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| I mean, I'm sure they could make more boats if they had those 1,400 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| But in private business, they have to cut their costs to be able to stay alive, stay in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4181)|
| 1:09:51| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| I'd like to make a friendly amendment that we take out the stormwater inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4195)|
| 1:10:03| We had a lawsuit, and we settled that lawsuit with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| And Mr. Norman, I'm sure, will remember, wasn't one of the conditions of that that we add more people for inspections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:16| You don't remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| I seem to remember that the inspectors was one of the conditions under which we sued the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4218)|
| 1:10:24| And so I feel like that we are obligated to add those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| And I also feel like it wasn't but about a week ago that Mr. Lockett came before this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| and this body told him that it would be okay for him to hire some new staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:42| So I think at the very least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| Well, a few of us disagreed with that, but we had a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| And it seems like I recall that I was on the winning side of that vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| and that we agreed that it was okay for him to bring on a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4253)|
| 1:10:58| So I think at the very least that we need to take the positions that we are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4258)|
| 1:11:06| settled a lawsuit and agreed to have, and that we should keep our word to Mr. Lockett that we gave him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| not what about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| Would you be willing to accept that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| I mean, I think the other positions can certainly be debated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| but I just don't see how we can debate those positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:31| I guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| I turned my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| Commissioner Lambert, I appreciate what you had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| and I think there's another one that concerns me as much or more than the ones you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| and that's juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| You know, we can't hold children for six months without a referee to try to get them back where they belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4314)|
| 1:12:02| I mean, that's insane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| That's just that we're just asking for additional law enforcement, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| the longer we hold them, the more it costs the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| And, you know, again, return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| A referee saves a whole lot of cost to hold those juveniles until they can be returned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| And that's, you know, that's another one of those that it's like how can we not do that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| You're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| I wish the maker of the motion would consider these friendly amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| I believe the one on juvenile court up here when they presented their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| we more or less voted to accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| Commissioner Hamlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| John, what is the bottom line on this if we do no new positions for one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4364)|
| 1:12:50| It's about $1,262,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Okay, so we're already saving through six months how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| Or is that the total year figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Yeah, that would be half of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| So we would save $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:06| And with a provision, and that is that we revisit it in December or January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4386)|
| 1:13:12| Let's see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| The company I work for is Forsman Little, which is an investment banker company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| They've got economists that look at this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Nobody's agreeing on anything as far as whether we're going to get out of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| if it's going to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Nobody really knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| So we don't know either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| So I'm in favor of the one-year hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| but I guess I would make a substitute motion that we have the one-year hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| but that we revisit in December to see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:37| You report to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| If things are not going well, we continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| But if things are going well, maybe we look at one or two positions like the juvenile judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| So I'll make that in the form of a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| Are you putting that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| I could do a friendly amendment, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| I'll accept that as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Okay, I'll just make a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| I guess I've got a question now for the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| Would you just exclude the juvenile judge, the referee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| I just said no new positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| Mr. Pinkston said that he thought that when we voted, we'd pretty much put that in his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| But I'm going with what he said, no new positions established for one year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| with the provision that in December we revisit it to see where we are with our revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| I just want to make sure that I can support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| but I want to make sure that the juvenile referee is, that he can go out and hire a juvenile referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:31| Would you put that in your friendly amendment, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| I think we voted to accept that up here today, but would you put that in your friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| Ms. Francis, is that something that was already in the budget, in this current year's budget, do you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4481)|
| 1:14:48| for the juvenile court referee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| That's new for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| But it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| But it would be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| It's in the proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| But it has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| That will be a part of this motion to not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| Eliminate that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| I'm not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| I'm not clear on this either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| No new positions except the exception of the juvenile court referee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:18| What about Mr. Lockett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:18| We promised Mr. Lockett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| I didn't promise him anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| I think he comes back in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| What about Stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| So that means we will not be staffing the new senior citizen center at Carter's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| That's what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Unless they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| No, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Well, I mean, but if this motion passes, that center would not have a full-time employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4535)|
| 1:15:41| I just want to make sure everyone's clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| Or Tommy Shumpert Park have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| Unless they can shift existing personnel over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| Or any new Stormwater to live up to the obligation Commissioner Lambert mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:56| Mr. Patel, when does Tommy Shumpert Park, when is it expected to open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| and the Carter Senior Center expected to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| October for Carter, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:13| We originally projected Tommy Shumpert to open this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| But, again, we had already pushed it back looking at that two percent to open next spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| What about the senior center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| October 31st is what I'm hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Halloween.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4587)|
| 1:16:29| Well, how are we going to staff it if we were under a hiring freeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4589)|
| 1:16:33| You're just talking about two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| We come back and examine it again in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| No, I'm not talking about that, Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| I'm talking about in the mayor's budget there was a hiring freeze until January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| Oh, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| How would that have occurred under the mayor's budget if a hiring freeze was already established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| So how are you going to staff that position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| We were going to move some people temporarily to get us through the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| Can we not do that now under Mr. Pinkston and Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| I don't think that we can do that for a whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| I think we could have pulled it off for November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| Well, he's wanting to revisit it again in January, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| He should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| And also this was part of the plan originally, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| If we weren't meeting revenues, you were going to extend the hiring freeze?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| I mean, that was part of the freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| That's why I'm saying in December, let's visit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| And if we're on track, then we can always, you know, look at it and put these positions in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| Yeah, the positions are in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| And I think that it would make good sense to revisit the hiring freeze six months in, like Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:35| I think just from a, you know, do you want to change the budget in mid-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| I think it makes sense to include them and just implement the hiring freeze until further action is taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:44| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| If a situation where Judge Irwin seen that he really needed an employee or another position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| could he come before this commission and request it and see if we approve it or not approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4672)|
| 1:17:57| Who was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| Judge Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Judge Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| He's already been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:01| I know that, but I'm saying let's say in the middle of the freeze, the hiring freeze,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| he may come back and say, hey, I need somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| And if he can convince this commission or at least ten votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| If he can convince this commission or at least ten votes, he could hire someone, couldn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| We're giving him that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Mr. Owings, can we not amend the budget at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Is that not what we do when we have line item transfers and those sorts of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| So, I mean, if he came down here and requested from this body, you could address it at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:28| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| There's a provision within our code that allows you to amend at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| In that case, I call for the questioner's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| What is the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| We have a second on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4718)|

| 1:18:44| Could we clarify the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| I mean, the motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4727)|

| 1:19:04| And we're going to look at these in December in case we have to fund some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| With that, Mr. Hammond, that's the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| That's the only position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4753)|

| 1:20:55| December is when you said, wasn't it, Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| See how our revenue stream is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| And we may approve more after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| But right now it's for a year unless something comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| Of course, the referee is still under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| The referee is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| He's still under the six-month hiring freeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4874)|

| 1:21:52| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| Commissioner Mark Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4915)|

| 1:22:02| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Eleven, six, seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:16| The motion passes 11-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| So what kind of savings are we talking about there, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| That's another $600,000, $630,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| Minus the referee for a half a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| We have no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4953)|
| 1:22:36| That's freezing all new hires, just so I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| That's freezing all new hires for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:43| And juvenile court referee for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:48| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| But these others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| For the revisit in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| To see if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| Now you can replace a position that's already funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| This is just new positions only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Mr. Owens, that's not going to affect the lawsuit or the consent agreement with the city, not hiring that stormwater person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:11| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| Ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4992)|
| 1:23:18| How many stormwater folks do we have, Bruce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=4998)|
| 1:23:22| I think we have nine or ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| But actually, the agreement did not stipulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| It stipulated the county would add four inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| And, in fact, when the stipulation was made, the mayor of the city of Knoxville was aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| The county had, in fact, already added those four inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| So they weren't anticipating or mandating the county hire additional people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| This is strictly something we feel is part of our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| So it's not going to violate any agreement that we have with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| I misunderstood the agreement, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| I still think we need more inspectors, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| Well, I was wrong on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| We finished it in 42 minutes, not 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5036)|
| 1:24:01| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Yes, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| When I was looking at the detailed budget and I pulled up space, as it was indicated that PBA said that was their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5045)|
| 1:24:11| particular line item labeling in the detailed budget, I just did a quick sampling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5051)|
| 1:24:18| And, again, this is on the back side of that three-page notes that I gave you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| In the Informational Technology Office, last year, $115,000 went for space costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:33| This year, it's $136,494.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| That was a 15 percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| When I went all the way down the board, the mayor's office operations, their space costs actually went down negative 3 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5079)|
| 1:24:47| I don't know why that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| The law director's office went up 17 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| However, records management was only a 1 percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Property Assessor's Office was a 10 percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| UT Knox County Extension was a 15 percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| Human Resources and Benefits was an 18 percent increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| And I know that they're charging the library system on a per, you know, per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5106)|
| 1:25:12| And so I'm not certain of the methodology of PBA's charge to all these different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| and all these different units within our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| And so I would like to throw a motion out on the floor, if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| to negotiate a contract with methodology that would be uniform and possibly only a 2 percent increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:37| since that's what the mayor so graciously offered as a percent increase to the people being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:45| So I think a 2 percent increase would be reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| I just think that this is really outrageous that there's this much of an increase across the board with PBA costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5149)|
| 1:25:57| Let me just address this a little bit, is that PBA has a proposed budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5157)|
| 1:26:04| One of the things that we do is we allocate it based on square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| and sometimes those square footage amounts change for different offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5167)|
| 1:26:12| Have that many offices grown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| Pick up and lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| And so we have within the city county building one fixed pie, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| but we changed the way that we slice it each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| Everybody, I mean, we recalculate who has how much space each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| and so that's going to affect how much they have on space costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| And so it could appear if you look at just one office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| if they haven't picked up an additional square footage, then their space cost is going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5194)|
| 1:26:39| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| I just asked him, and he has not increased his space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Mr. Law Director, has your space increased that much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| No, we've been out of space for several years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| I mean, we're operating, as I told you in the budget hearing, we're operating out of a broom closet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Did the mayor's space go down, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| Did the mayor's space go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:02| Yeah, there's the mayor's office traded three offices that were down on the third floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5222)|
| 1:27:10| Who took those offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| With all of this electricity, utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| This includes electricity, utilities, security, all the PBA's costs all in the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:24| So we're just allocating that total among all the offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:29| You know, if everybody, I don't know how many of you all have computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| and how many of you are looking at them right now or people at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| but when you go to KnoxCounty.org and you pull up the budget and you pull up the detailed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| it has a little find button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| And if you type in space and then you hit return, you will pull up 91 instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5261)|
| 1:27:47| where PBA has hidden their costs all across our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| And this is costing the county a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| Let me just mention about the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| I'm looking at, you know, page 31 of this handout for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5278)|
| 1:28:03| And their current year budget is $47,117.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| And their proposed budget is $47,117.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| So it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| I didn't think it had gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| I was surprised to hear that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| And I wondered why we were receiving all that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| Page 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| And all we're doing is just allocating PBA's cost among the different departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| in the most fair way that we know how to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| And that's based on square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| We update that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| And that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| Commissioner Davis, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| Did you make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| What kind of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Did she make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| What is he saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| She's not made a motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| She made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5327)|
| 1:28:52| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| Commissioner DeFries, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| I didn't know if you wanted to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| I'd like to make a motion to amend the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| The Great Schools Foundation this year, the proposed funding is $3.8,023,874.00.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5343)|
| 1:29:15| And I'd like to make the motion that we move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| I know that the school system has some part of that budget that they have already promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| to certain programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5364)|
| 1:29:25| But I'd like to make a motion that we eliminate the Great Schools Foundation minus whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5365)|
| 1:29:32| those promised costs are that the school system has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5372)|
| 1:29:37| And if there's anybody here from the schools that could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Because I know probably the pre-K program or some of those others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| I'll do what with the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5385)|
| 1:29:50| Who seconded that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| Well, I thought right now we were just talking about cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| and then we would talk about additions later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| But where I'd like to see it go is just directly to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| But right now, I thought we were just talking about cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| The biggest thing that the great schools, and I'm sure we need to get an educator here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| is the TAP program that the great schools funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| And I think we need somebody from education to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman, before we go any further with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| I need to disclose that my sister-in-law is a teacher at Northwest Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5422)|
| 1:30:30| that does receive funds through the TAP program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| And I just wanted to let everybody know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:41| Anyone else want to disclose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Mr. Chairman, I have a daughter that's employed with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| I likewise have a daughter and a son-in-law that teaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| I have a daughter that teaches at elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:01| I've got one grandchild that's in the school system, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| Go ahead, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| I have a son-in-law that teaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:17| I have a cousin that works for the school system, but I have no idea what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5477)|
| 1:31:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| And visiting with Ms. McPherson and Ms. Buttry, this money is already allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:29| This money goes directly to school projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Our birth to kindergarten initiative, our teacher advancement plan, our kindergarten intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| our middle school development program is all in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| This is something that the Board of Education is counting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| When we had our joint meeting the other day, this is one of the cornerstones of their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| And I would certainly hope you wouldn't touch these funds because if you cut this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| you are directly cutting education funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| No, but I'd like to see it go directly to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| and let the school system budget those dollars directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| I'm not interested in paying operational costs for the Great Schools Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5521)|
| 1:32:06| I know that there is one staff person and there are also travel costs associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| And I'd like to see, I don't know, they gave us the travel stuff the other day, and I didn't have a chance to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5531)|
| 1:32:18| Do we know how much those costs are, anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| They are very small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| What is Ms. Kershaw's salary, Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| Offhand, I couldn't tell you what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| We can make that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Well, I mean, is it $50,000, $75,000, $100,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:41| Yeah, but in addition to Ms. Kershaw, there's also one other person, a support staff person, secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| And let me say, physicians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| we have talked extensively with our current superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| and we've had discussions with our new superintendent who's coming in about how this is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| We'll make some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| But the majority of these funds, they would like to stay in the Great Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| where you could test programs like kindergarten intervention, like birth to kindergarten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| like the teacher advancement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| And if they work, they will go to the school's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| But this has been very systematically thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| Mr. McPherson has worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Ms. Buttrey, I compliment her and the members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| They've worked with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| This is something that's working very, very well, and I don't think we should change it at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| This happened to me before, and this is the second time that this has happened to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| I was shutting down my computer, and I had this message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| And I had this message before, and I showed some of the other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| It says, other people are logged onto this computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Shutting down Windows might cause them to lose data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| Do you want to continue shutting down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| And I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| And before I called tech and they said, don't worry about it, you're not being hacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| But it's happening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| And I just wonder about what is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5631)|
| 1:33:53| Has anybody else seen this kind of message when you're on your computer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5633)|
| 1:33:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Well, who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Brian will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| If anyone knows, Brian will know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| He's the hacker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5644)|
| 1:34:09| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Brian's hacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:13| I don't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| Yes, it is Windows XP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| This has nothing to do with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| If she could work that out, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| I've got a question about the Great Schools Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| If it is a good idea, why not, why don't we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| Why don't we give the money to the school system and then let the school system give it to the Great Schools Partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:50| Why don't we let the school board decide how much goes into the partnership and how much they use for general operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:58| You know, I mean, I really trust our school board to know what to do with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| And if they want to put it back into the partnership, what would be the harm of us sending it to the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5703)|
| 1:35:10| and then letting them decide what to do with the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| Let me just answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| The school board approves every one of those dollars before they're spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5719)|
| 1:35:20| And one thing that I'd like to remind the commissioners, the school board, when we fund the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5720)|
| 1:35:26| there's a provision about maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| And so if we fund a program that is something that the county doesn't want to continue, once we fund the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5728)|
| 1:35:37| then we have to continue that level of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| If it's in the Great Schools Program, then if you decide not to do a program, you can not continue that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| And so that gives you an opportunity to try something out without making a commitment on maintenance of effort for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:52| Well, I mean, I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| But why does this commission have to allocate it to the Great Schools Partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| Why not just allocate it as a standard part of the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| and then let the school board allocate it to the Great Schools Partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| Because here's where I'm at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| If it's such a great idea, then I'm fully confident that our school board will allocate it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:20| And if our school board, who are all, I'll be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| know a little bit more about education than myself as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| if they make a different choice to maybe put less money in, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| then I really trust them to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| The school board held a second information session for commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| There were some of us that weren't able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:49| And I was just asking Commissioner Davis, and I know Commissioner Lambert was there, I believe Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5809)|
| 1:36:58| There was like eight of us that were there that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| And I recall, and, you know, maybe I'm getting older and don't remember as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5820)|
| 1:37:07| but I thought that they told us in that meeting that they did have an issue with the Great School Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| And if Russ Oaks or anybody's here that was there that day that would like to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:21| Ms. Davis remembers the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| But I agree with Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| I'd rather give the money directly to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| If the school wants to put it in that, then that's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| But to designate it for that partnership doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:39| We're not supposed to tell the school how to spend their money, but yet we're going to give them money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| and tell them we're going to put it in this account form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| Put it in an account where we've got some control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:47| And I'm ready to give that control to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| And that's why I'm going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| And we do have some school board members here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| Do I see Cindy Buttry out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| And is that Karen out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| I don't think the school system has a problem with the Greatest Schools Partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5880)|
| 1:38:05| because we were at a meeting Thursday and they were asking us to give them more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5885)|
| 1:38:10| and to have a tax increase and give it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| For raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| I know that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| Yeah, for raises for teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| For the two percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| No, it was more than raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Well, plus an extra million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Did you want to address this, Mr. Griffin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| Mr. Oaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| Commissioner Strickland, I just came up on Commissioner Daniel's request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| I was at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:33| I haven't heard the board as a body express anything one way or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:39| but individual board members have expressed their own opinion along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5919)|
| 1:38:47| Commissioner Ballot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| I see Ron McPherson is back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| He looks anxious to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| He's the number guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| You want to go over the numbers or what this goes for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5935)|
| 1:39:02| Well, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:04| The long and short of it is 3.8 million is what the mayor has allocated in his budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| that could be committed to great school initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| Another $1.7 million of state pre-K grant money could go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| Essentially, that gives the great schools or initiatives for the great schools partnership approximately $5.5 million to operate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:28| The dilemma, however, is if you look at those initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| and those initiatives include pre-K, kindergarten intervention, TAP, birth to kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| There's some very worthy initiatives in that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:39| Those expenditures, however, total at this point approximately $7.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5979)|
| 1:39:45| So right now there is a $2.4 million deficit to fund all of those initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| So if any of that money, if any of those funds were reduced, regardless of where those funds would go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5990)|
| 1:39:58| then it would obviously create more of a dilemma for those initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| But there has been, there was a joint meeting this week between partners of the great schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:10| as well as members of the board, a work session, if you will, to discuss this particular dilemma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| and to look at some of those initiatives to determine which of those initiatives are working best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:24| We look at and we're continuing to do that at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| And there's some very good initiatives in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| I can't presume to speak for the board, but I can tell you that the board is happy with some of the results of these initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6030)|
| 1:40:40| There's already a dilemma, I guess you could say, with regards to how we could fund all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| And you lose a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| The grant is specifically targeted for pre-K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| There is a matching portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| So we would be required to use some local dollars to continue pre-K, depending on how wide we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6054)|
| 1:41:02| That's pretty much a commended program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| I'm not arguing with the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| I understand that they're all quality programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| What I'm concerned about is that we are paying for someone their salary and then their travel expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| And I just looked up very quickly cursory what Mr. Troyer had given us on May 28th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| the travel report from July to, I guess, March 31 of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| And just very quickly I added up close to $7,000 in travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| And I'm not exactly sure what the salaries are, but those are actual dollars that can actually go into the school system directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| And that's what I'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| And I'd like to see that the school system, if they think these are quality programs that they want to fund, that they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:54| And as I understand it, that once after a certain period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6114)|
| 1:41:59| that the Great School Partnership was going to turn over budget control to those, to the school board anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| When I understood the Great School Partnership and its original inception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| it was supposed to be only used for county dollars and then they were supposed to include public monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| and private monies and they were supposed to get grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| And it's just been the county that's funded them to the tune of about $13 million in, you know, three to four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:26| Well, you know, everybody loves great programs and we need to make sure that they're effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6146)|
| 1:42:32| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| But we also have to remember that it's county dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| And if we are going to follow through with selling to the public that grants are going to fund this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| that private business is going to come in and help fund this, then we need to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| And we haven't seen that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| So I'd like to just turn it over to the school system and let them make the decision that if these are programs that they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| to invest in, they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| And then the operating expenses they can use to help fund those programs as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| or to do whatever they'd like to with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| The fundraising hasn't worked the way I hoped it would either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| but I think the new superintendent and some people are going to be addressing that early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| The maintenance of effort piece that Mr. Troyer mentioned is incredibly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| What this allows us to do is to try certain programs without committing to funding them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| If we move the money over there, that means we're committed to that money from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| So they can't end programs at any period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| The school board can't decide, okay, a program is not working, let's stop it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| They have to fund it forever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| They can end it, but we have to keep funding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| So what this allows us to do and the schools to do is to try a program like Birth to Kindergarten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| And most of their programs are very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| In fact, the governor came here because we had it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| But we didn't know if it was going to work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| So we tried it first in the Great Schools Partnership where a commission is not obligated to fund it forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:03| It worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| And now we're beginning to move pieces of it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| And I hope we can continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Obviously, each of us want to support education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| We would like to support it more than we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| But the maintenance of effort comes into play as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| I would hope that we could keep, well, let me back up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| We do, you're right, we need to do a much better job of raising private sector dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| And I think you're going to see that happening as we make some changes and adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| But does Mayor, is there a reason that we can't give that money to the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6267)|
| 1:44:34| And if they want to turn around and write a check for it, is that an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| The issue is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| Once you give that money to the schools, you have to fund it again the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| You cannot go backward on your funding by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| That's the maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| We haven't ever gone backward on school funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| We've only gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| I know that we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| It gives you that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| So, Mr. Mayor, you're saying that we can go backward on our funding, the Great Schools Partnership money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6297)|
| 1:45:07| We can go backward on it, but we can't go backward on the money that goes to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6312)|
| 1:45:13| Have we ever gone backward on our Great Schools Partnership contributions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| We're going backward this year because we moved more of it over to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:20| Once we proved it worked and they wanted it moved, we moved some over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| So, yes, the Great Schools Partnership budget has actually come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| Yes, I really don't have a particular question for the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| but I would like to make a substitute motion that we delay this decision until we get the new superintendent in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| You know, the whole concept of how they relate with the school board and the school system may change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| And it may be worthwhile to wait until he gets in because we may take a completely different direction with our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| The other thing is I do have some really grave concerns as to why the private sector hasn't stepped up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6352)|
| 1:45:59| and contributed to this and they need to be doing, I think, doing more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| I agree very much with what Commissioner Davis said about this is that I would like the schools to have the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6363)|
| 1:46:09| but we might want to wait until the new superintendent gets in and get his input into what role they need to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:18| I'll second your substitute, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| Mr. Law Director, I don't believe we can quite do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| We have to allocate the money through our budgetary process, and I don't know that's something that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:34| We have a school board member that would like to address this, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| But I think Commissioner Blutholdt needs an answer to that question before we move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:45| The funding is not going to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| It's my understanding the funding would stay as is, but we would revisit it when the new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| Was that your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Well, that's after the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| And, I mean, are you just saying let's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6416)|
| 1:47:01| Once your funds are, once you've adopted a consolidated budget, approved the school system budget included within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6421)|
| 1:47:11| you would have to have agreement of the school board in order to amend their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6435)|
| 1:47:16| But one thing that I just want to pipe in here is that if this budget is adopted as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| we can certainly administratively hold that money until the new superintendent comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| until we have a consensus on how to use that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| And we certainly don't have to pay it over to anybody until we're all comfortable in how that's going to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:35| So we could hold the money until and maybe come back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6455)|
| 1:47:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| Not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| We have a school board member that would like to address us, and they always let us talk when we go to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6462)|
| 1:47:47| So I think we should let her speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| Andy Budry, 6404 Ridgewalk Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| The only problem that I could foresee in you doing that is that the board itself has not decided what programs they are going to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:12| with this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| For instance, right now, Targeted Pre-K, which is under this scenario of the partnership, is still up for grabs, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6494)|
| 1:48:26| And if we do not have those dollars and do not know if that's a program we're going to continue to fund or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| then state funding becomes contingent upon that, the matching grant dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| And while I applaud that, and I think that's a great effort because we do want to wait for the new superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| and those kinds of things, for some of the programming, it also has an impact on what we can do for the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6525)|
| 1:48:54| If we don't know for sure what the budget is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| So in some regards, if we're going to be receiving less dollars or more dollars, we just need to know before the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6538)|
| 1:49:10| That would be my only concern in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| Ms. Petrie, I know you all have had some conversations with the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| Is he familiar with this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6564)|
| 1:49:25| Is he in favor of continuing it, you know, according to what you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| Or is there anyone here that would know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| I can't speak for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Is there any way we could give them the funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| You don't want to ever lose any matching funds because that's sort of free money, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| I don't know, is there any way we could fund them partially like we do some of the other grants where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| we give them a quarter of the money just to get them started so they'll have enough to cover that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| We're very, very comfortable to work closely and we certainly do with the staff of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| and we'll make sure that we maximize our state revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| And then what we could do is when the new superintendent comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| we could get his opinion after he studies and thinks about it a little bit more as to what he wants to do along with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6605)|
| 1:50:14| with the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Because we'll want a recommendation from the superintendent and we'll need confirmation from the school board that that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| in fact, what the school board wants to do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| I'd like to let the motion stand then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| We have a substitute motion on the floor to hold the money until the new superintendent comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| starting with the ninth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| And what is your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6636)|
| 1:50:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Commissioner Pankston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6641)|

| 1:51:18| I'm going to recuse myself because I'm a representative of a greater school partnership for this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6685)|

| 1:51:43| So the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| I'd like to make another motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| Are we moving on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| I'd like to make a motion to amend that we eliminate Legacy Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6714)|
| 1:52:00| It's $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| I believe that, of course, Mr. Smith is on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:10| Mr. Clayton donated, what, $3 million to the Legacy Park Foundation not too long ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6730)|
| 1:52:16| $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| So I think that they've shown that they have really been able to raise funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| and I think that that's something that they need to do on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| and I'd like to eliminate that $50,000 from the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:32| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| Commissioner Ivan Harman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| I'm glad Doug stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| I'm on the Legacy Board Park Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| and I know they have a lot of land but not a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| So they need that fund, I'm sure, to operate on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| So I'm going to let Doug speak to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| Exactly right, Commissioner, and I appreciate your service on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| I think this is the best investment in the park system we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6776)|
| 1:52:59| I mean, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| I'd rather take a knife and cut it out of my operating budget than to hit this foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| It's just it's doing the right kind of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| We have one person that's being funded jointly between the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| We provide some administrative support and some office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| But right now they've done so many projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| and over a million dollars in donations and land have come through in the last two years out of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| $50,000 a year investment from the city and $50,000 from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| So the return on investment for this foundation is tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| Do we think eventually we'll get to the place where we don't need to support them yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| We sure hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| But right now the fundraising effort is really going towards capital and not towards operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:37| And I think we can get there eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| You know, but I think the return on investment is very good to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| It's the best thing we've got going for the park system, both city and county, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6823)|
| 1:53:48| Again, you know, a hundred acres at Amherst, added on to Iams Nature Center this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| over a half a million dollars fundraising in halls for a new park up there one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| So they're doing tremendous work, and to me it's just a great return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6837)|
| 1:54:01| Well, I agree, Mr. Patel, and that's why I think that they can be solving on their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| because they have shown that they are very, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| And I would agree, but I think you need to give them a little notice to go there, to cut it off, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| immediately in the next two months as it would be a challenge for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6860)|
| 1:54:21| Then I'll cut it to half, to $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6861)|
| 1:54:26| Does the second agree to the motion to cut to $25,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| I agree to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| Oh, pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6873)|
| 1:54:34| Commissioner Mormon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6874)|
| 1:54:35| Yeah, thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Would you speak just briefly to the history of the Legacy Parks Foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6876)|
| 1:54:43| And, again, I agree also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| I think this is a huge quality of life issue for Knox Canyons, and how Legacy Parks supports open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:55| greenways, protection of hillsides, all these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| They're getting involved in a lot of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| But could you give us a little bit of background about Legacy Parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:09| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| This really came out of our park board, which the city, county, and town of Farragut representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| and citizens on several years ago, and really copying a model out of Oglebay Park Foundation in West Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:23| a small town that's done a tremendous job of fundraising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| They've raised over $50 million for the park system in the last 30 or 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| So we're modeling it after that that we hope to grow into that one day that absolutely is self-sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6932)|
| 1:55:37| and supports the park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| And, really, it's there to take us a step higher, not to replace tax dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| but to raise the level of our park system to take that next step up in quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| And, really, I think for the small amount of money, too, there's a tremendous board of directors there of all sorts of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| throughout the community, Tommy Shumpert's the chair, Marilyn Roddy's vice chair, Tim Irwin's on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6953)|
| 1:56:00| There's about 20 citizens that have just done a tremendous job and become very engaged in these park projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| Without that foundation, that engagement would not be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6966)|
| 1:56:09| The monies that we're seeing come through would not be coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| So they are really engaging the citizens in a creative way to support our park system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| I'm not interested in diminishing Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| I still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| Appreciate it, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6984)|
| 1:56:26| And I think anything, if anything, Legacy Parks is, of course, extending our park system in ways that are truly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:37| and make our county different in terms of the types of things that our citizens have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=6997)|
| 1:56:46| And it's just to do anything regressive in terms of funding is going backwards definitely for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7006)|
| 1:56:55| This is something that's a minor expense and a great return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| Well, I agree that Legacy Park is a great foundation and the work that they are doing is an excellent goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| What my concern is is that $25,000 or $50,000 can be turned around and helped with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| that are working families that fall through the cracks that we heard about with regards to the interfaith clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7034)|
| 1:57:22| There's a lot of very serious needs in this community, and we need to make sure that we're really addressing those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:30| I think that Commissioner Norman is correct that quality of life is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| It's an intangible that you can't really associate a dollar cost to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| But when you have so many families struggling right now, I think it's critical that we fund those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| that really help families the most, and that was my intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| It's not to diminish this foundation's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| I think that they do an excellent job, and they've proven themselves that they've done an excellent job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| and they know who their contacts are, and that's where I had hoped that they would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7074)|
| 1:58:00| and make those concessions to those people and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7080)|
| 1:58:05| can you please help with our operating costs and get those private dollars into their operating costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:12| to where the county can use those dollars for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7096)|
| 1:58:18| Doug, Legacy Park this year raised how much money, in your opinion, just around the ballpark figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7098)|
| 1:58:23| Well, just on the halls project, a half a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7103)|
| 1:58:26| Half a million dollars, and you paid somebody's salary at how much approximately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| Gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Just for that one area, because you've got one person doing it, but she does more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7112)|
| 1:58:38| So a ballpark figure, how much of her salary would be donated to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7118)|
| 1:58:42| Just to that project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7123)|
| 1:58:44| Oh, gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:46| Half her time, 25 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Probably 25 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| Big project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| And on the flip side of what you're saying, we're paying her 25 percent of her salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7132)|
| 1:58:57| which would be a ballpark figure of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| Gosh, maybe 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| We're paying somebody 20,000 to 30,000, and that individual raised $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| And you're talking about the others, and I understand what you're saying to people, the needy people and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7148)|
| 1:59:14| They've got board of directors, same as Legacy Park has board directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| They're paying one person this small amount and raising 500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7159)|
| 1:59:23| What are these other board directors doing for these health agencies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7163)|
| 1:59:29| Motion on the floor is to reduce the funding for the Legacy Park Foundation from 50,000 to 25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| I'll just withdraw it because obviously there's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| Second agree to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Motion is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| Does anyone else have anything with regards to the budget before we move into community grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| So, Vice Chair, are the contractual funding items listed in our book considered part of the grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7189)|

| 2:00:03| You know, that's up to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| You can tackle them separately or take them up together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7205)|

| 2:00:37| so the people at home will understand basically what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7237)|
| 2:00:42| With that 40 million and the 8 million from our fund balance is somewhere 59 cent tax increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267080618specialbudgetpart2?start=7242)|
