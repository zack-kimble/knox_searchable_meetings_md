| 0:02:16| 5A, Maria D. Garcia, El Rey, 3515 West Emory Road, on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:26| Good afternoon, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Would you please tell us your name and your business address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| My name is Maria Dolores Garcia, and my business address is 3515 West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=151)|
| 0:02:38| And you're applying for a beer license for the El Rey restaurant, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Do you have a certificate of registration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| Of registration for what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| When you applied for the permit, the state business license certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| Oh, yes, I have the business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| It's like a 30-day due thing, and they still haven't actually gave me the renewal of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=177)|
| 0:03:07| We're going to need a copy of what you received from the state, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| I'm going to ask you a series of questions that you'll have to answer out loud to regarding your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| Have you or any of your employees at this location been convicted of any violation of the laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| against possession, sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=205)|
| 0:03:31| or a felony involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Has beer ever been sold at this location before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| So there's no outstanding license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Do we know if this is an on or off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| So this is an on-permit application only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Now, what is your relationship to the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Does anybody else, do you have a business partner or are you the sole owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| No, I'm the sole proprietor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| And who's going to operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Are you familiar with the beer laws and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=241)|
| 0:04:04| and do you agree to conduct yourself and your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=248)|
| 0:04:09| Have you taken a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| When do you intend to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| As soon as I find out if I'll be approved to sell beer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| You understand that until you take this course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:22| and you give us proof that you've completed it, you can't sell beer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| Okay, ma'am, now I'm going to talk to the staff here for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| and make sure that we have everything we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| Beer Board Inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| This property is, as it is right now, in violation of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:47| The applicant is going to have to seek a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=287)|
| 0:04:52| They're within 500 feet of an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| In the shopping center zone regs, if you're going to sell beer for on-premises consumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=296)|
| 0:05:02| you can't be within 500 feet of a residential or agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| So she's going to have to seek a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals to be able to serve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| Now, do you know if she has applied for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| She has not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| I spoke to her just prior to the meeting, and she said she will apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| I'll refer her to the Building Codes Office to make application for next month's BZA agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:25| Do you understand this situation, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Realistically, until you, one, have a server training, and, two, if and when the board approves a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:36| and that could affect whether or not you get a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| My point is that the commission probably at this point can only tentatively approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=339)|
| 0:05:46| I'll defer to the commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| No further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Of course, the other option is to defer this until that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| I'll make a motion that we defer it until she has the BZA and also the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| I hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Do I have any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| I agree with the deferral, but I hope when she comes back we don't impose another fee on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| If there is a fee associated with applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| No, there would not be an additional fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Ma'am, the gentleman to your right, my left, can explain to you exactly how the process works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| so you understand the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| So until such time, you've got to get past the zoning board before this commission can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| 5B, RR and SS Incorporated, Lucky Corner, 6400 Maynardville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| off-premise formerly TriStar Dailies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| Good afternoon, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=408)|

| 0:07:00| Now, it's my understanding that there is a beer license currently issued to this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| You'll have to surrender that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| And have you acquired a business license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=427)|
| 0:07:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| Have you received a copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| The clerk is going to need a copy of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| All right, sir, just like the applicant before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| that will also require you to close out the previous beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| And, again, our staff can assist you with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| I'm going to ask you a series of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=450)|

| 0:11:44| In 1 John 4, 12 through 16, we read that no one has ever seen God, but if we love one another, God lives in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=704)|
| 0:11:53| God is love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| Whoever lives in love lives in God and God in him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=715)|
| 0:12:00| Russian writer Leo Tolstoy wrote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| Love for one another gives one a true feeling of good, and it unites one with other people and with God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=724)|
| 0:12:13| A clever man loves not because he wants to profit from this, but because he finds bliss in love itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| Do not regret the past, or else the use of regrets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| The lie says you should regret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| The truth says you should be filled with love, just as a mother puts her life at risk to protect her only child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=748)|
| 0:12:37| So everyone should guard and save himself for every living being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=757)|
| 0:12:44| The fearlessness, calm, inner peace, and joy which are given to us by love are so fine that nothing in the world can be compared with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=764)|
| 0:12:55| especially for the person who understands the real blessing of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=780)|

| 0:13:06| And Commissioner Ivan Harmon will lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=786)|

| 0:14:37| I'll miss you, Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Now you understand, Commissioner Norman, part of your job is to keep the new law director in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| You'll need every bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| Next is we're going to have amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| So Commissioner Markharm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| Mr. Chairman, I draw your attention to the agenda where it says zoning requests A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| Metropolitan Planning Commission, the East Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| It is marked deferred to May, but I would like to know when and where that deferral went into the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| Mr. Law Director, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| He's talking about a zoning issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Is that appropriate to talk about that now or zoning issues or can we go ahead and resolve that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| It's the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| It's being resolved now, and I believe, if I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| I thought that a member of the MPC came before the commission during one of the committees and requested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| But I can't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| I was here for both finance and intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=937)|
| 0:15:39| I just don't recall that happening, nor do I recall a vote occurring to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| It's my understanding, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, it was during the agenda committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| During the agenda committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| The agenda committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| I do not want to see a deferral on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| I object to that most strenuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Well, as of right now, it is on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| That's only a recommendation to defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| So pending someone else, another commissioner asking for it to be deferred, we will hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=966)|
| 0:16:12| Is there going to be a motion to consider it at the appropriate time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| At this point, we'll just get to it when we get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| But at that time, it could be considered if the appropriate motion were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| It could be considered at that time as a deferral, unless someone at this time wishes to make that as a defer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=981)|
| 0:16:28| and then we would vote to whether or not to defer it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| I just want to make sure because I had heard that it had been deferred at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| and, of course, there was not a quorum at that workshop, so no action could have been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| I need to pull 101 and 102 off the consent calendar, and 102 I need to defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1011)|
| 0:17:00| I'd also ask that 906 be taken off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| Let the clerk catch up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| 101, 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| And I assume that you wish to hear 101 as soon as we can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Mr. Chairman, in regards to 906, I would like to move that up on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| and make sure we hear that prior to 501.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Solidated plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| And I'd also ask that the second reading of 101 be moved as far up as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1048)|
| 0:17:38| The board chair, Ann Inking Cannon, is here and wishes to speak on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| and we don't want her to wait around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| And also the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| And that's ordinance 101?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1067)|
| 0:17:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| On the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| On the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| And under other business, the first discussion on the 10-in-10 challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| I would like that to be moved forward also, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| after the honorary resolutions and the resolution on the safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1079)|
| 0:18:08| and the ordinance on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| The due 10-in-10 challenge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| I would like to do that before the end of the meeting, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| You wish to do that after the honorary resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| No, after India and the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| After we hear 101?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| And also I would like to add a discussion item on softball tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1104)|
| 0:18:34| All right, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| It's time to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Are you saying that Indian Cannon is not here to discuss the softball tournament?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Well, I can talk to her about that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| I've got her phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| We did defeat them last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| We did, but I wasn't –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:46| Did we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| I believe we won that tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| We've got to defend our title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| We've got to start the trash talk now, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| We have the trophy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| We've got to get that trophy another year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| Yes, I would like to – this gets back to what Mark Harmon was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| about deferring the sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| I am going to ask for us to defer that for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| and the reason is, and I hope you'll agree with me on this and you may not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| is that it was announced out at Carter High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| when we had the meeting Thursday evening that it was going to be deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| and my concern is that since that announcement had already been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| there may be people from the area that wish to speak on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| who will not be here today to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| Dr. Briggs, I think this is bouncing around too long, and we've heard from both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| I really would like a vote, especially so people can be informed as they go in to vote during elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| Are you making a motion to go ahead and defer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| We can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Like I said, my main concern is that there may be people here who want to speak to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| that are opposed to it that won't have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| because they were under the impression that it was not going to be before us today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| so I'd like to make a motion that we defer it for 30 days and then we can decide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| Whatever we decide on is okay with me, but I would like to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| And since we do have an objection to that, we'll take a two-thirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| Or you can wait until it's heard now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| I mean, later in you can make that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| It would only take the ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| I guess you could still make it even at that time, but just to go ahead and clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| We'll do a roll call vote on the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1235)|
| 0:20:43| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| If this fails, can we still go back to the ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| You can still go back because it will just be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Let's just wait until the end then to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| I'll withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| I'd like ordinance 103 and 104 withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| And ordinance 010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| And those are on first or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| First reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| And I'd like ordinance 0-10-4-110 added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:23| Clerk, do you have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| I believe that may have been passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| It should be in front of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| It's been distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| And there are, that was the, are these to be added, Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1307)|
| 0:22:00| the ones about the mayor, the commission, the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| and some of these other ordinances, have they been added to the agenda as to be added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| and we just need to add them or are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| Yes, they're to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1336)|
| 0:22:18| The request came at the last meeting we had on the 20th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1338)|

| 0:31:10| I would like to ask a question, though, about the amended 907 amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1870)|
| 0:31:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| What's your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| I don't recall precisely what the amendment was, and it was not read out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| I believe, Commissioner Pinkston, do you remember that amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| I believe it was just to send the letter down there and ask them to study it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| Yes, it was just simply instead of, it was just a legal request asking for whether it can be done, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Yes, the discussion we had, Commissioners, Mr. Chairman, is that essentially requests of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| they would normally just defer to their legal counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| So rather than ask them to take any legislative action, it would be to ask them to refer to their legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| because their specialty, of course, is legislative enactments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=1913)|

| 0:34:03| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| My name is Michael Conrad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| I live at 5316 West Beaver Creek Drive, Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| I'm here today to talk about a problem that I've had going on for over two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| a business that is operating illegally within 37 feet of my home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| This company has been in front of this commission, the BZA, the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| and Sessions Court one time and Circuit Court two times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| This matter has been denied by all these bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| On January the 8th, 2010, Mr. Wilkerson was denied by Judge Workman again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| On January the 25th, 2010, at this commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| I told codes enforcement that Mr. Wilkerson's business, outdoor design, was not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| On January the 29th, 2010, Mr. Wilkerson was back in Judge Workman's court trying to get his fine reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| The fine was $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| In court, I do not know who told Judge Workman that Mr. Wilkerson was in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2106)|
| 0:35:13| It had to come from either Mr. Wilkerson, codes enforcement, Mr. Wilkerson's attorney, or the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:23| But the fine was reduced from $5,000 to $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2123)|
| 0:35:28| Mr. Wilkerson was doing business on the day he was in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| Mr. Wilkerson, I found this out on February the 7th, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| I contacted the law director's office and talked to Joe Jarrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and explained to him that Mr. Wilkerson was not in compliance and was not in compliance on January the 29th, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:54| He was still doing business as he always has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| Mr. Jarrett said he would check into this matter and he would get back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| After several days, I had not heard from Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| I tried to contact Mr. Jarrett by phone and went to his office two or three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| He was not in. I left messages for him to call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Finally, Mr. Jarrett called me sometime in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| Mr. Jarrett said to me this matter was over and there was nothing that he could do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| After talking to Mr. Jarrett, Paula and I went to the mayor's office with pictures and videos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2184)|
| 0:36:32| This was on April 5th, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| The mayor said he would check into this matter and get back to me and Paula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:39| About a week went by and Paula called the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| The mayor said he would have someone call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Grant Rosenberg called us a few hours later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| He sent Kim Ayler out to our house the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| She found out that Mr. Wilkerson was not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| Mr. Wilkerson has been cited to court on May the 13th, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| This will be the fourth time Mr. Wilkerson will be in court on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| It seems to me that so far Knox County Government has been unable to enforce the rulings of the Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| the BZA, the MPC, and Knox County Courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| Can anyone on this board give me any answers as to why Mr. Wilkerson is able to operate with all these rulings against him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2240)|
| 0:37:29| and has not moved his company to an appropriate zone for commercial business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2249)|
| 0:37:39| Mr. Wilkerson stated to me and to others that he would do whatever he wants to do on his own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2259)|
| 0:37:47| and there's no one going to tell him what he can or cannot do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| Do any of the commissioners think that we need an amendment to any of the ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| that would state that a company found not in compliance to the ordinance should move until a final decision has been made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2278)|
| 0:38:10| Mr. Wilkerson, it's called outdoor design, it's a commercial business, has broken more than one ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| There are four that I have found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| One is operating a business in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Two is a contractor's storage yard in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| Three is dumping materials in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| And four is manufacturing materials in the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| I think that he needs to be cited on all of these violations separately by the proper departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| These departments have been notified of the violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| I would like to hear from the commissioners what they think the county should be doing about these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| Thank you and I'll take any questions if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| You know, I apologize to you from the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| You know, you've been up here probably three years on different matters and as a commissioner, this just really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| We're not giving you the service that you deserve as a constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2354)|
| 0:39:21| You know, I know times are tight and times are tough and there's not much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| But to me, this isn't easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| You've got violations that are going on and we seem to be dragging our feet on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2369)|
| 0:39:35| You know, Joe, I don't know if you can write a letter to Judge Workman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| and if he says that Grant has sent this Kim out there and Kim is finding that there are violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| we need to stand up and tell the judge what we're finding on our end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| He shouldn't have to be coming back here time after time after time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| It makes us look bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Can we not do our homework?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| One, this gentleman is not the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| So he doesn't have legal standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2407)|
| 0:40:08| We've tried to explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| I believe it's his friend's or girlfriend's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| He's not the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Secondly, this has been litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| The codes enforcement obviously doesn't report to my office, but it's my understanding they've cited him repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| We've litigated this in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| He's going back to court for another violation, meaning Mr. Wilkinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| There's a pending appeal between the court of appeals where Mr. Wilkinson's attorney is appealing the last violation that we successfully litigated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2428)|
| 0:40:36| So the issue here is in terms of how codes is conducting their business, that's not a law director issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2436)|
| 0:40:43| In terms of the legal aspects, the only thing we can do legally is if codes brings us a legal citation, we prosecute it, which we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2443)|
| 0:40:52| But, again, I think the redress they're seeking, the court is not often empowered to grant at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| The last time we litigated it, Judge Workman held him in violation and told him to cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| That was the issue of the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| Then Mr. Wilkins' attorney appealed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| So we have two actions going in court, one before the court of appeals appealing the last action we took, and we now have a new notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2471)|
| 0:41:20| But in terms of legal redress, we've done everything within the bounds of the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| In terms of what, if anything else, Mr. Grant Rosenberg's office can do, that's an administrative codes issue that I can't dictate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2485)|
| 0:41:35| Are you not the property owner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| Paula is the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| You are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| And I'm part owner of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| We've been there since we bought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| But it's just in her name, not in my name, and hers together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| It is in her name, but we bought it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| I mean, I've seen the both of you here on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Grant, can Kim, can she write a letter to Judge Workman saying what she's finding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| Well, let me, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| Excuse me before Grant speaks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2520)|
| 0:42:01| I'm going to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| It's a legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| It's a pending litigation matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| Litigants do not approach the judge ex parte and send letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| If they try to contact the judge on a matter that's before the court, it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| The matter is now once again before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| If they have a codes issue, they contact codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| Codes informs us once they're cited and we take them to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| But a court's not going to entertain a letter from litigants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| But then could Kim write a letter to the property owner and the property owner take that to court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| Can they tell what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| Well, it's an excellent question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| I think your question is what can they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| They can file a private nuisance action any time they'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| They can litigate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| And quite candidly, oftentimes a court is more concerned about what one neighbor does to another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| than what a person does to a bureaucratic entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| They normally will take that even more seriously because, again, it's a property dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| But, again, in terms of legally, we've done everything we can legally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2579)|
| 0:43:06| Ma'am, what do you want, what else can we do for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| What needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| I think what Michael was trying to, I think, ask of this board was that we have been up here so many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| for this particular situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| And I think what we're asking, do we need to have some kind of amendment that people in a situation like we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| that has to deal with this nuisance all the time and it not, for instance, have him move his business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2611)|
| 0:43:39| until a final decision, whether it's in all the courts or what, is made so we don't have to deal with the nuisance all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| You know, it's as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| If you could just state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:51| Paula Yarbrough, 5316 West Beaver Creek Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Grant, could you update us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Because I know you guys are busy too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| Update the commission on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| I'd like to, Grant Rosenberg, Knox County Neighborhoods Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| I'd like to speak to one point that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2643)|
| 0:44:05| Nobody's dragged their feet in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| Every time our office has received a phone call, whether it's from the law director, from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| or from Ms. Yarbrough or Mr. Conrad himself, he has my cell phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| And every time he's called me, I send someone out there as soon as I can get someone out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| And when that officer goes out there, they don't witness a violation of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| Mr. Wilkerson is permitted to operate a landscaping company on his property as a home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:33| And that's what the violation is that we finally cited him for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| And when we finally decided to cite Mr. Wilkerson, we're doing it based on their testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2675)|
| 0:44:40| So we're actually citing them and putting them down as a witness in the court case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| because we're not seeing the violation when we go out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| And he may be operating on the weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| He may be operating very early in the morning, very late in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| We can't be out there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| We can't stake out the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| I have limited resources to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| But we have spent a lot of time on this case over the past couple years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| And I just want to make sure you all understand this isn't a case of us dragging our feet or not wanting to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| We just simply need to be able to witness a violation in order to cite to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| And as Mr. Jarrett has said, you know, this case will be decided in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| If they take video, was that good enough for you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| We witnessed a video and we cited him on behalf of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| But you all have to keep in mind this is an agricultural zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| And Mr. Wilkerson, you know, he's operating a business, but he's also got a nursery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2726)|
| 0:45:32| He's classified himself as a nursery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| And he has plants that he's growing on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And he has bobcats and machinery related to that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| Now, he's also, you know, operating as a contractor in our opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| And that's what we've cited him under the home occupation regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| But it's not as black and white as one would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| There's a lot of gray area in between in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| Are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Yeah, I was just going to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| And I can understand the frustration that you're experiencing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| And if I'm incorrect on this, you know, I'd like the law director to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| If there's some laws or ordinances that we don't have, you can come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| And if we need to pass something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| and I think this is what we can work with Grant Rosenberg's office with, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| But we're not a court to judge whether he's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| whether this person is conducting a business illegally or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| And I don't think we have any authority ourselves to assess fines or give orders to cease and desist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2790)|
| 0:46:35| I believe that can only come through the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| And that's the limitations that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| We have other people that come up here that your heart just goes right out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| You know that they're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| But as a legislative body, we can make laws and we can pass ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| But we don't have any, you know, any authority to enforce things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2809)|
| 0:46:54| And I want you to know we're very sympathetic to it, but we are limited, I believe, by what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| I think what we're trying to get some input from you all as to what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:07| And I'll say on my part, I'll encourage, you know, Mr. Rosenberg to continue to have his inspectors out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:14| his codes inspectors, and if there's violations, they need to be cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| But if it's a dispute about, you know, whether it's a legal business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| or an illegal business or any orders, court orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I think that all has to be handled through the judiciary system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| One other thing, if I could, Mr. Chairman, members of the board, that, again, complicates this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| The property owner, Mr. Wilkinson, did apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| and receive a license from the state to operate a nursery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| That then falls under the Right to Farming Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| which is strictly regulated by the state agriculture and liberally construed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| And under the State Right to Farm Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| you've got to be profoundly careful trying to restrict what the state believes to be agribusiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:55| And the state will react harshly, in fact, become an opponent of ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| and, in fact, side with the landowner in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| And we'd end up in litigation against the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| So my point is we're doing everything we can legally, but we have to move carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| And now if the commission wants to entertain more punitive legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| we can certainly draft something for the commission's review that we think is legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| And I understand the frustration of the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| I've litigated these things for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| They're horrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| They're problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| And I can understand the frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Why can't a body politic just fix this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| But when you start getting involved with state licensure, state regulations, the right to use of one's land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:34| it's not the same as somebody operating an illegal business or dumping affluence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:40| It's a difficult scenario or affluence, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2920)|
| 0:48:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I want to ask another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I want to see if I understand what you're saying about the ag land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2928)|
| 0:48:54| Am I understanding that you're saying that local government and ordinances can be overruled by state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2934)|
| 0:49:01| Oh, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| The state does what's called preemptive power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| In other words, the state declares in the state legislature that they have the sole right to regulate certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| Then they will essentially trump local ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| For instance, the state has decided that the state alone will issue liquor licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| Now, the county can issue a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| The county may not by law enforce or interfere with the state liquor license law, in other words, hard liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| The state can likewise do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| So that's one of the issues we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| This gentleman has now acquired a state license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| He's now put himself under the protection of the State Right to Farm Act, and that could further complicate the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| So it's not a matter of not wanting to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| It's a matter of we go into court and file an action, and the first thing the judge is going to do is say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| what about this statute, and we have to have an answer for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| But don't you think that our local ordinances need to use the state ordinances as a guideline when they're writing them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| so we don't have problems like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| Well, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| Our ordinances do not conflict with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| But again, up until recently, this other state statute was not in the equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| It's now brought into the equation by his state licensure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| It's not in conflict with county law, because there is no county law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| because there already is a state law entitled the Right to Farm Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3016)|
| 0:50:23| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I just wanted to say that I've been watching this from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| and I think this gentleman is his landscaping company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| It has grown beyond the point where it's no longer an owner-operator with one truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:39| He does have several trucks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| But Grant has been very responsive to the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| His officers have been very responsive to it, and this is something that's clearly in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:54| One thing, the perception that we're the county commission and we can do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| well, the truth is we're the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| We're not noble lords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| We don't live under a feudal system where we've got some power to go and beat people up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3064)|
| 0:51:10| and force them to move their trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| We've got laws that we have to deal with, and I understand what you're going through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| and like I said, I've been out there and seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| If it was a few less trucks, it might not be as bad as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| but it's clearly grown to the point where it does resemble a commercial business to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| and probably doesn't belong there, but the courts are your remedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| and as much as we'd like to, it's the gentlemen across the breezeway that wear nice black robes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:43| that you probably need to be working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| And thanks for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| I do have another question, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| Mr. Wilkerson has been in front of these bodies, in front of these courts and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| and he has tried to throw smoke screen after smoke screen after smoke screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| He tried to say he was a horticulturalist instead of a landscaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Now he's saying he's a nursery instead of a landscaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| Okay, and I did name off a few other ordinances of Knox County that he was a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| We have these on video, and that's why I'm asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| don't these all need to be a separate violation instead of saying he's just running a business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:28| I mean, there's violations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Manufacturing, hauling in debris, which is illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| Bruce Winker told me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| The things that he's doing is illegal, and they know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| and I think it should be, he should have, instead of one citation for running a landscaping business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| he ought to have four citations for manufacturing, hauling in debris, and other violations that he's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| And I think then all four violations be took into court, not just the one, and he should be fined all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| But I did tell Grant Rosenberg at this meeting on January the 25th, standing right back there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:10| that Mr. Wilkerson was not in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Four days later, they walk in to court, and he's in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| He was never in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| The stuff was still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| The bobcats were still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| The equipment was still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| The trucks were still there, and there was employees there working on the day he was in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| And it goes to court, and he gets his fine reduced because somebody walked into that courtroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| and perjured their self in that courtroom and said, hey, he's in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| And he was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Mr. Conran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| That's what I'm sitting here wondering about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| Mr. Conran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| I hate to do this, but your five minutes is up unless another commissioner wishes to extend you to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| I do believe we gave you our best answer we could today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| Unfortunately, it's in the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| I wish there was more we could do for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| It's election time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Unless another commissioner wishes to give you a few more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3242)|
| 0:54:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| I have a Lynn, Ms. Renee Lynn, or a Martha Woodward that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3253)|
| 0:54:25| I believe Ms. Woodward called the commission office and has withdrawn that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| To speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| And I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3272)|
| 0:54:33| Did Larry Silverstein, did you wish to speak now or do you want to wait until Resolution 908 comes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| We'll call you at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:45| Was there anybody else that wanted to speak at public forum at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3285)|
| 0:54:51| If not, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| We're on page eight, Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| It is honoring the Knox County recipients of the 2010 Girl Scouts of Tenassee Council Gold Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:11| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| If you could read this into the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| This is a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee honoring the Knox County recipients of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| 2010 Girl Scouts of Tenassee Council Gold Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award in girl scouting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| symbolizing outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| career planning, and personal development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| And whereas the Girl Scout's accepting and nurturing environment allows girls to build character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| and develop qualities and skills that will benefit them throughout their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| And whereas the Girl Scout Gold Award is a distinction that represents many hours of hard work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| service, and dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| And whereas one of the requirements for the award is using those skills to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| and complete a project that benefits the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| And whereas it is an accomplishment achieved by a very small percentage of those who participate in scouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| The Knox County Commission hereby honors and commends the 2009 recipients of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3383)|
| 0:56:28| prestigious Girl Scouts of Tenassee Council Gold Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| Be it further resolved that the Knox County Commission extends their best wishes to the Gold Award recipients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| for their continued success as they pursue new challenges and goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3397)|
| 0:56:42| Be it further resolved that this resolution be presented to the recipients of the Gold Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3402)|
| 0:56:47| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| I just want to say we only have six of our Girl Scouts here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| but do we have a total count on how many Gold Award winners there were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3424)|
| 0:57:08| Suzanne, do you have that number off the top of your head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| Yeah, it's close to 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| There are a lot of girls who achieved that this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| and this is an award that takes an incredible amount of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| an incredible amount of energy and hard work to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| There has to be a project that has to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| It's way harder than being an Eagle Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3451)|
| 0:57:36| So we really, really, I'm very, very proud, very proud of these girls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| and I would like to give them the opportunity to step forward and introduce themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and tell us what your project was and where you go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3467)|
| 0:57:56| My name is Madison Armstrong, and I go to Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| My project was I teamed up with First Baptist Church Concord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| and did a school supplies drive for Western Heights Baptist Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3482)|

| 0:58:21| I cleaned all the toys and painted the walls and did a mural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| My name is Autumn Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| I'm a senior at Carter High School, and my project was planting seeds of love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| I redid some planters at Northgate Terrace Recreation for a senior citizen high-rise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3515)|
| 0:58:43| My name is Alicia Bergen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| I'm a senior at Carter High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| I did homegrown for the hungry, and I grew a garden and then harvested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| and gave the produce to a local food kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3529)|
| 0:58:56| My name is Nora Kay, and I did a victory garden for the Manor House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| It's a local food pantry, and I built raised bed gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| I harvested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| I built all the beds, put up a fence, and gave all the vegetables and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| and I even made a manual for them to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Where do you go to school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3550)|

| 0:59:18| I am a senior at Hulse High School, and I worked at the Interfaith Health Clinic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| and I helped the pharmacist, Amy Warner, put the patient information from the files,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| the copy back files into the computer to make a database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3569)|
| 0:59:32| so it would be easy for her just to find the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| and be quickly to get them their medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| Mayor, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Well, as you can see how articulate each of these young women are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| it's not surprising, but it certainly is very impressive that they've achieved this significant honor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| and I passed on to Commissioner Brewer's resolutions honoring each of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| and we thank them for coming down here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| When you look at what they've done, and I'm speaking as a token Cub Scout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| That was tough enough for me, but they've really taken it a step further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| and I know that we want to show them our appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| I'd like to add that Girl Scouting creates girls of courage, confidence, and character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3609)|
| 1:00:25| who make the world a better place, and that's what these young women have been doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3625)|
| 1:00:30| and what they're going to continue to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| and I'm excited to see what they do as they move into adulthood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3632)|
| 1:00:37| And I wanted to let you girls know we have individual resolutions from the commission and from the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| but since there are about 50 of them, I'm going to deliver them to the Girl Scout Council office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| and you can pick them up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3647)|
| 1:00:52| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| Thank you. Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| Okay. Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| The next item has been moved up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| It's ordinance 0-10-3-101 listed on page 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| It's an ordinance to add a new section to the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| to require that school board districts contain voting precincts that are reasonably compact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| contiguous, not overlapping, nor contain split voting precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| effective with the redistricting following the 2010 federal decennial census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| This amends Knox County Code Part 2, Chapter 2, Article 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| established in Section 2-7, previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| This is on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| It was approved 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| I'm going to let the chairman of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| That's what I was going to do, was just ask what their opposition to this is and call on you to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Members of the commission, I'm India Kincannon, again, chair of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| I appeared before you last month when you had this on first reading and gave some preliminary feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| And in the ensuing month, I had the opportunity to get a formal vote on the matter on behalf of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| And I'll first tell you what I did is I did some research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| and actually worked with John Gustin and someone from KGIS to develop maps of the seven places in the county where this occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3743)|
| 1:02:33| where the voting precincts are split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| And I would say it affects maybe 100 households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| I didn't count, but it's very small areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| And I learned to my dismay that four of them are in my district, and I wasn't even aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| Anyhow, and then I drafted a resolution in support of the ordinance and presented it to the board at our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| And the board, the resolution failed to get a second, and we discussed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3776)|
| 1:03:02| And the reasons were that not a single board member was in support of it, not so much that they like split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3782)|
| 1:03:10| Nobody was in favor of split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| But I think the primary concerns were that we want to retain authority over our own redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3793)|
| 1:03:21| and we aren't sure what the legal authority is for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3801)|
| 1:03:28| And also that we thought it would be more efficient to address these and related issues all at once during the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3808)|
| 1:03:37| And there was even some discussion over addressing some of the issues discussed a month ago that aren't relevant to this ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| such as perhaps aligning school board and county commission districts and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| that the board was certainly open to discussing that further when we discuss redistricting as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| But the Board of Education does not support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Ms. Kincaid, I appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| My concern is more along the lines of what you were talking about, the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| It's very confusing for voters and for us to explain how school board has districted yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:23| I myself have to report to five school board members to get anything done in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| And I think that's disingenuous to the people that we serve when we can't guide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3870)|
| 1:04:38| I mean, one elementary school is here, one elementary school is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| I mean, I've got four or five elementary schools that have different board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| And one should be the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| I mean, district six school board should be district six commission in the same districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| The schools in my district should be represented by the same school board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| It's efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| It's clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3897)|
| 1:04:58| Everybody understands it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| That's more along the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| I don't like split precincts either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| I don't think one side of a subdivision should vote for one and then the other another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3902)|
| 1:05:09| But I believe that I'm more concerned about the districting that you brought up because the needs in Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3909)|
| 1:05:17| where you represent Powell students, and the needs at Fulton are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| And I think that to have community schools, what we should have, they should be represented by people in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:28| And I don't think we have that right now because of the way that the, and I hate to use the word gerrymandering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| but the way the districting is done, it looks gerrymandered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| And it looks to where we picked up something to provide for confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:45| And where there's more confusion, there's just chaos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| And I think that we have that in our school board districts as far as representation board wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| And I hope that we can get together on that after the census is out and look at the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| and consider somewhat getting together on those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3960)|
| 1:06:06| Commissioner Andrews, I think that the board is very willing to have that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3966)|
| 1:06:10| And, you know, I think that we can make things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| And it's my understanding from Greg McKay that other counties in Tennessee do have alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| where the county commission district six is the same as school board district six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| So it is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| I think we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| You know, I think there will be some ironing out around the boundaries and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| It's going to be difficult because of the, you know, in 2012 some seats are up and some seats are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| And so we're going to have some confusion or there's going to be some difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| We're going to have to work with the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| But I think the closer we get to that, the better off we can represent people equally, both you and I both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4002)|
| 1:06:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| My question is going to be more or less for the law director because I hear your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:58| or one of the major concerns being whether or not we can ask the school board to draw lines that we like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4018)|
| 1:07:08| or we don't like or even raise the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| So, Mr. Law Director, the concern that the school board would have that they don't want us messing with their districting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:21| what's going to be your take on that supposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Commissioner and members of the commission, as you know, we discussed this early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| The charter provides vague guidance and it essentially affords the school district the opportunity from time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:37| to alter their boundaries, but then it's followed in conjunction with or essentially within constitutional requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:45| You defer back to state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| The statute does require commission districts to be contiguous, not overlapping, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| As we discussed from the very beginning, there is no black letter law that reads it's a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4076)|
| 1:08:03| There's no black letter that reads that it can't be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| Again, when the commission considered this from the beginning, I mentioned the fact that we think it's defensible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4087)|
| 1:08:15| but again, if you're looking for a specific statute either way, that definitively tells you one way or the other it doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| Are you done, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Mr. Chairman, could I just comment one thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| One thing is I did confer with the law department and our school board districts are in fact compact and contiguous and not overlapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4108)|
| 1:08:42| Of this ordinance, the only thing that's not already true is the split voting precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| We're already in compliance with the state statutes that Mr. Jarrett just cited, but in the split voting precincts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| the only law that speaks to that concerns commission districts, not school board districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Really, my question was not as to whether they're compact, contiguous, or even split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| My question is whether or not we, county commission, should be messing in the way school board wants to lay out its districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4151)|
| 1:09:19| I think that in light of no real direction, as autonomous as the school board is, I believe maybe they ought to make their own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4159)|
| 1:09:30| I would concur with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| I believe Commissioner Wright and I are in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| I think given especially that school board has evidenced willingness to work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| when the census is complete and redistricting begins, I hope we can work things out and have a smooth transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4187)|
| 1:09:57| but I'm a little bit reluctant to tell them what they must do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| I would much rather have a good back-and-forth working relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| and obviously if that doesn't work, then perhaps we make better action later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| But I would right now like to take this off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4217)|
| 1:10:19| I agree with Mr. Anders on several features of it, that clean, I'm sorry, simplicity and clarity is always advisable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4219)|
| 1:10:33| But in this issue, the thing that tends to be aggravating for him, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:42| is all of the various school board members that he has to address within his commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4242)|
| 1:10:50| And that's really going to be, as we've said before, it's subject to the demographics of school-aged children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4250)|
| 1:11:01| That's what the districts are formed to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4261)|
| 1:11:07| And so, you know, and then the other issue, we do have improving relationships with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4267)|
| 1:11:14| and we need to continue along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| And so, and I agree with Craig, with Mr. Luthold's desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4278)|
| 1:11:28| I think it is, these are desirable things, but right now, I just don't see how we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| And I don't think really that it's advisable for us to be dealing in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4294)|
| 1:11:40| And so I defer to the wishes of the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Just for means of clarification, I guess Mr. Law Director or maybe Mr. McKay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| when the 2010 federal census is completed and we're sitting down looking at districts, who will do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4312)|
| 1:12:01| I guess Mr. McKay or somebody from the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| Well, actually, I think that is a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| Our charter spells out who does the districting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| So who does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Is it a special committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| Is it, if you would, refresh my memory on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| I know that we've just gotten through doing some redistricting for the commission, but how will that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4335)|
| 1:12:23| If I can have a moment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| I had some notes on that, but I don't want to be vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4345)|
| 1:12:29| The reason I'm asking the question is that it would seem to me that however this is going to be set up is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4349)|
| 1:12:35| let's make sure that the school board is brought to the table on the redrawing of the lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| because we're going to have to do it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| And so it just seemed to me that maybe in the ordinance we could specify that this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| or whomever is going to redraw the lines, that it has school board representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| along with whoever else is going to be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| That's why I was asking the makeup of the group that's going to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| I believe it's ultimately our responsibility of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| because really the same question came up when we needed to do the recent redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| and we went ahead and appointed, if you recall, a committee or a commission to do the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| And I think it will be done the same way after we have the results of the 2010 census| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:15| as it was done on this last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| It would seem to me that if indeed that is the case, that we would maybe include in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| or a separate resolution or something making sure that the school is going to have proper representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| on this committee to do the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| If I could just address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| I believe as a law director is looking that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| but what I recall is that the school board will draw their districts within the guidelines set by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:49| I'm not sure whether or not the county commission gives it an approval or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4429)|
| 1:13:55| but I think that the charter gives the school board the authority to draw their own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| And the county commission has the authority to draw, just like we did within the last several months, to draw ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4442)|
| 1:14:13| And the only thing that this ordinance would do is require them to do the same as what state law requires the commission to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4453)|
| 1:14:24| which is that we cannot have split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| They would still draw their districts any which way they wish to draw them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:35| It's just that with this, they would have to follow the same rules that we have to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:40| which is they could not have a split precinct such as Farragut North is split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| Some of them are, I believe, in the 6th and some of them are in the 5th school board district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| So I don't see that as a heavy burden, but maybe they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4490)|
| 1:14:59| But if the law director would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| Well, the committee that we had before had several meetings and it took quite a while to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| because as they got into it, they started finding out it wasn't just as simple as just looking at a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4506)|
| 1:15:10| I mean, you get into emotions and people wanting to be in certain districts and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| So that's why I'm asking about the whole process once this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| It's a complex process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Obviously, you have to have public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| The charter distinguishes between, as I mentioned earlier, the school board's ability to take a look at their districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| The charter itself outlines with some specificity the manner in which the districts are created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:41| The constitutional requirements, a lot of it defers to state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| So it's a complex involved process that clearly something like this can be included in those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| But in terms of if you're looking for a more precise line-by-line methodology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| our charter defers to the state statute because of some state preemptive law there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:04| So we might just say because what we did last time, we'll probably do that again, create a committee to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4564)|
| 1:16:09| make a recommendation to us, and we'll have the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| And I would assume that the school board, I don't want to speak for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| but I would assume the school board would go through probably a similar process to come up with their redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| I imagine so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| And like I alluded to before, I think a joint committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| especially if we are going to consider aligning commission school board districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4585)|
| 1:16:30| I think the board would be interested in participating in a joint process where a few members of each body participate on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:39| and then bring it back to their respective bodies for approval is something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| But I think that the law department is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| The law and the charter are silent on the process, but we can come up with one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| And I think we do have a good, harmonious working relationship where we can work together to come up with a process that's best for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4612)|
| 1:17:01| And please don't get me wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| I didn't bring this forward because relations were good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| I brought this forward only because in my mind, okay, it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| The state, for whatever reason, decided that county commission districts should not contain split precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4634)|
| 1:17:22| And I find that they had some very good logic behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| And why they did not apply that same law to school board districts, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| But I just felt like it would help, in my mind, some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4653)|
| 1:17:40| Like you stated, there was maybe a few hundred at the most that were in this situation that they were in a split precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:51| So we're not talking about a big change, but a change to help those folks and to maybe clarify and get rid of some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4671)|
| 1:18:00| And I'm still of the mind that when a community speaks as one, then they are stronger than a community that's split.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:11| And in my mind, when you split a precinct, you have split a community, which this body talked about during the last redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:20| was very, very important to them that we not split communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4700)|
| 1:18:24| And that's what we did as best we could when we went through the redistricting for the upcoming election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| So I was just trying to follow some of the lead that I heard during that, that we should try to keep communities together as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:40| And the only way we can do that at this point, the closest thing that we have as a community is a precinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| And I don't think we should be splitting communities, precincts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| They're about as equal as we can get within this voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| Mr. Vice Chairman, if I might, before I relinquish the floor, I'd like to make a motion that we defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| and request that you and Ms. Kincannon and the law director get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| I'm hearing that there's some common ground here of coming up with a methodology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| I'd like to recommend that we do that and come up with a method for drawing these districts that would include the school board and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4747)|
| 1:19:14| I see this as an opportunity for us to do that. I'll put that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| Do I have a second? Do I have a second? Okay. Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| I'll turn my line around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| Okay. Is there any further discussion on the deferral for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| Do you want to keep it 30 days or do you want to make it a little longer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| Let's go 60 and that will give you plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| Could I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| What are we conferring on exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| We'll just get together and we'll see if we can't find some common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| On just this ordinance or on the bigger picture stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| On all of it. The bigger picture, on this ordinance, whatever we can sort of come together on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| Okay. 60 days sounds better than 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| I thought we needed 60 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| 90 is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| I guess before...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| We could push it out much further and I won't be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| I guess before India leaves, because it implies that we still want to have an ordinance on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| would it perhaps not be better just to say that when we form these committees or commissions on redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4804)|
| 1:20:11| is just do our best to try to get them to line up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| Because what I don't want to do is to handcuff the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| where there may be some very good reasons both for the children and for education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4818)|
| 1:20:22| to have the districts the way they are rather than by codifying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| and then saying you've got to do this regardless of whether it's a good idea or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| And where the collaboration can be is when we actually draw those committees up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| Rather than trying to redo the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| is just say when we do the commissions both for the committees for the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4839)|
| 1:20:43| and for the commission districts is to do the collaboration at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:47| rather than putting it into an ordinance and saying you've got to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4847)|
| 1:20:52| Well, I guess through our collaborations we'll come up with something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4852)|
| 1:20:57| whether it involves something like the ordinance before us or if it's something entirely different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| we'll report back to this commission I guess is what Commissioner Haman is trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4863)|
| 1:21:08| What I'm trying to say is get together and let's try to come up with a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| and it may be that you completely redo this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| Or maybe we don't need an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| Or maybe we don't need an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| But I do believe it's helpful for the school board and the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| to come up with some kind of methodology after the census so that we can look at redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| and have all parties at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| And I might consider talking to people at the Howard Baker Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| to find out what other communities have done that's been effective as far as redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| and if we want to follow some of their examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4896)|
| 1:21:40| I do know that we're one of the few counties in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| that the school board gets to draw their own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| The commission draws them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| I'm wondering if you all are going to get together and talk about the process for redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| which isn't going to happen for a while until after the census is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| It's going to be at least a year before any redistricting takes place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| So what you're saying is that you're going to get together now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| you're going to talk about what that process should be, how it should look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| who should be involved, and then come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| And also you're going to try to convince the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| that they shouldn't want split precincts when they've said that they don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4942)|
| 1:22:27| And I'm just wondering if we should either just vote this, yes or no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| or just withdraw it and go ahead and put together a committee to look at redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| I don't see the point in postponing a vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| when really what I think you're talking about doesn't really have to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| It has to do with how we're going to handle redistricting when it comes up after the census is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| Well, you'd have to ask Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| He's the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| I think it would be helpful for the two of them to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| The more people you get involved in the process, the more it's going to, in my view...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| I agree. And I agree that they need to get together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Actually, we need to have several people get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| and talk about how we want to handle redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| So is that the point of this getting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| or is the point of the getting together to hammer out the differences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| that the school board and Commissioner Luthold feel about this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| I think it's both to get together and look at any differences they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| and see if we even need this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| But also for them to start the discussions on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| Like you say, it's a ways off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| And there's going to be more meetings on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:33| But give them an opportunity to see if we can come up with some kind of framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| to bring before us and the school board as to how we might handle this redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:41| We went through this before and it becomes very emotional and it becomes very political.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| And so I'm thinking that if we can start the process now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| it may help us as we move forward with it in the months to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| But that's my motion is that they get together and come back with some type of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| And maybe don't have any recommendation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| And it may be if we don't come with something in common,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| I'll bring this right back for second reading and we'll vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| Or we'll bring forth something together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| India, would you prefer that we go ahead and take an action on this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| and still I think move forward with a group to talk about redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| or do you want to handle it as two separate issues or do you want to handle it all rolled into one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5062)|
| 1:24:28| To me, I think that the ordinance as written, the board has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| And I don't think that unless if the contents of the ordinance stays the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5073)|
| 1:24:38| I don't think the board's position will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| So I think we could talk about it more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| but I don't anticipate the board changing its view on this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| I think that there's great value in discussion with me and Commissioner Luthold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5090)|
| 1:24:55| and other board members and other commissioners about how we want to go about redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| So, I mean, it's not that I don't want to talk about this ordinance more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| but I don't know if the specifics of this ordinance with the board's view will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| Then I would like to go ahead and vote on this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| But go ahead and make a motion that we go ahead and start getting groups of board members together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5115)|
| 1:25:22| with commissioners to talk about how we want to handle redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5122)|
| 1:25:26| But I see it as two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I would like to go ahead and vote on this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| and let the board go ahead with what they need to be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| Is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| No, you've already gotten a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| No, we don't have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| The only motion that's been made so far is to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| Well, I guess we can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| I will simply vote not to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Well, that, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Commissioner, she's not made a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| She's just letting her know that she's going to vote against the motion on hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| It does seem to me that at the end of whatever the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| that we want to work out some relationship with the school board toward the redistricting effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5169)|
| 1:26:15| and all of us would like to have something that is contiguous, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| So I agree with Amy, and I guess I will offer a substitute motion to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| and I'm not exactly sure how to do this, but probably just to withdraw this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| because it seems to me if you have any sort of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| you're going to come back with something different anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| If it comes back materially different, then we've got a new ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| and we've got to start the process all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| You can make a motion to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| You can make a motion to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| You can, I mean, however you wish to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| But I want to go further and in the motion ask that Commissioner Hammond has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:55| that we get committees together, we get the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| and various members of the county commission together to work toward some joint agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:06| that smooths out our lines, that makes them contiguous, et cetera, as best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:12| and works toward that with the new census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| So that's an awful lot of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| And if we can hone it down to a few, withdraw the ordinance, set up the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:25| and work toward everything that we obviously or at least we appear to want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| But basically take this off the table right now because that seems to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| Well, I think you're talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| As far as, well, no, I'm talking about your motion is actually two different items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| If you can't have one part of your motion to withdraw one item and then add another item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5262)|
| 1:27:51| I would like to withdraw this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| If you wish to make that, that's fine, but that takes it completely off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| and it doesn't get back to what Commissioner Hammond was trying to do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| You can't have both in that one motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Mr. Law Director, can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| No, so unfortunately they're so bifurcated that you couldn't combine the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5288)|
| 1:28:12| I see the effort, but again, this is really a legislative issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5292)|
| 1:28:17| There is precious little guidance in your charter in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| So, you know, this is a legislative issue that's the reason I can't be of a lot of help in terms of the mechanics of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5302)|
| 1:28:32| You could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| I think in that case I would rather do as Commissioner Poyles has suggested, let's just vote on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5315)|
| 1:28:40| Of course, there is a motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Well, there's just one motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| That's to defer, and that's all we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| If someone wishes to make a substitute motion, then whatever you wish to do, you can withdraw, you can motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5327)|
| 1:28:58| Can I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| I'll be with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Are you done, Commissioner Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| I appreciate the effort that's going on here and I hear what everybody's trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| but part of my point is that it makes precious little sense to put together a committee right this minute to look at redistricting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5349)|
| 1:29:19| when we don't have any information from the census yet to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| We can sit around and drink coffee and say, yes, let's all work together when census information is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5364)|
| 1:29:30| and it's time to get to work and let's make everything match up, but there's no data to work with yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:38| We don't have a committee that's really set up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| If we do this, we need to set up the committee and specify who's going to be on that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| and I think we're just really putting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| Let's vote on this ordinance, yes or no, or withdraw it or whatever, but I don't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| and I think we all agree that when it comes time to do the redistricting and we have the data from the census,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5397)|
| 1:30:05| that's the time to get together and start working as a committee, and yes, we all want to work with the school board on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| I think that's going to happen when the time comes, so I will be voting against deferring this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:19| and then I will be voting no on the ordinance, and then when the time comes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5419)|
| 1:30:24| when we have the data from the census and it's time to move forward on the redistricting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| I will definitely be very much in favor of putting together a fabulous committee made up of citizens, school board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| county commission members to handle the redistricting discussion at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| Mr. Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| I believe we've got a first and a second on the floor to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| There's no more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| We do have Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| Hearing no objections, everybody's lights off, do you want to withdraw your call and we'll just go right to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| It'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5465)|
| 1:31:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| Instead of having to vote on it twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| We're going to vote on Commissioner Hammond's motion to defer for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| and asking if there's some common ground or some guidance that if I and Chairman Kincannon can come back and report to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5475)|
| 1:31:25| is that putting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Yes, and I'm not suggesting that we go ahead and establish any kind of committee to look at redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5488)|
| 1:31:32| I'm saying that you all get together, start talking, and come back to us with your discussion and then we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5492)|

| 1:34:48| was good, but at the end of the Intergovernmental Committee left me a little bit confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| And that's why I'm glad this is off of consent and we get to talk about it a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5693)|
| 1:34:59| My concern is the funding for the CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| And I know Mr. Rosenberg has some statements to make in that regard, and I suspect Ms. Kelly does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5702)|
| 1:35:11| So straighten me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| At the end of that meeting, I was sufficiently confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| You were paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| The Safety Center proposal in its relation to CAC, what we're going to do this year for this program year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| we're going to move forward with the proposed consolidated plan, which you'll be voting on next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| And in that proposal, CAC is receiving about $550,000 in funding for minor home repair, rehab,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5731)|
| 1:35:40| and water sewer programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| At this point, since the Safety Center has not been submitted to HUD as an actual proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| and the funding and everything else hasn't been put together yet, it won't affect CAC in this program year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| If Safety Center moves forward and is approved by HUD as a Section 108 program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5756)|
| 1:36:02| what I provided to you all last week at the committee meetings is how that Section 108 proposal would look if it were approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5762)|
| 1:36:12| if and when it is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| And at that point, then there would be an impact on CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| However, for this upcoming program year, it won't impact CAC as proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| However, if we move forward at some point with a Section 108 program, which you all would have to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5785)|
| 1:36:32| that could be what the impact would look like if it were proposed by me as a Section 108.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| That's how we would structure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Well, it seems to me we've got a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| The resolution, as stated here, endorses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| It doesn't actually ask for the development of a Safety Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| It endorses the development, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| So time-wise, what are we talking about here in terms of the steps we're going to have to go through to come to agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5814)|
| 1:37:03| and moving forward on a Safety Center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| I think everybody here wants to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| Provided we amend the CON Plan next to reflect the possibility for a Safety Center and Section 108 funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| I wouldn't be able to submit a proposal to HUD until probably early July after we submit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| which when our program year takes effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| So it might be prudent for this body to, instead of approving the concept of a Safe Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| perhaps ask our Purchasing Department to issue a request for proposals for a Safety Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| And that request for proposals could effectively serve as our proposal to HUD for the funding, for the capital funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| And what that does, that can nail down some of the other items that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| this body's discussed related to, you know, who's this serving, operational funding, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5866)|
| 1:37:52| So that might be a suggestion that I have to this body is to move forward with an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| and then, you know, everything's open, transparent, and we have a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| I was wondering if the pot grant funding remains as proposed before the change that you submitted last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| This year, at what point, I guess, back up a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| I suppose then we might actually be able to massage that and come up with either different funding or some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5895)|
| 1:38:24| in other words, we've got a little time to work with this is what I'm suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| We have some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Are there other ways that we can achieve what we're trying to achieve here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| If we do Section 108, I mean, that we want to move as quickly as possible because that's a long process for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| Now, if the commission wants to find another way to fund the capital development of this center, then it can do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5917)|
| 1:38:46| At this point, you know, I've been asked to pursue Section 108 funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| In order to do that, I need it reflected in the consolidated plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| and I need to submit information to HUD that shows that this center is going to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| meet HUD's national objectives that we have the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| and we have the operational funding for a period of time for this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5944)|
| 1:39:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| When precisely, if we pick up on the recommendation that you made at both committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5954)|
| 1:39:20| when precisely does that funding kick in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| That was part of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| Our program will start July 1 of this July of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5964)|
| 1:39:32| How can that not affect their funding, CAC's funding this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| It won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| What we're going to do is we're going to put the safety center concept and Section 108 program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5977)|
| 1:39:43| we're going to put that in our comp plan as a medium priority item, which means we don't have to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| and we don't have to do it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5988)|
| 1:39:50| For the next five years, we can submit a proposal for a safety center as Section 108,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5990)|
| 1:39:56| and we can submit that proposal, we can submit it July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| Now, as far as the funding, the funding may not come until July 1 of 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| So for this program year, we'll move forward with the proposed funding for CAC and our other initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| Do I understand that you submit these every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| We submit a consolidated plan every five years, but we also do a one-year action plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6018)|
| 1:40:24| So in the action plan next year, we could have a, theoretically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| could have a proposal for Section 108 to build a safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6027)|
| 1:40:37| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6037)|
| 1:40:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| I'd like to make a motion to amend, if I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| Grant, would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| What you need is for us to amend the comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| Which will be heard next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| I think we're speaking on the safety center proposal right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| We'll take that up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| And do we need to change this for purchasing to submit it for an RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| It might be prudent to amend the current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| I want to make a motion to amend 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| Do you wish to just make that as a friendly amendment to the maker of the motion so we don't have to make it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| Friendly amendment for purchasing to add an RFP for the safety center to see what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| so we can get it from purchasing, see what the figures are going to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| Does the maker of the motion accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6083)|
| 1:41:25| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| And does the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Second agrees to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| I sure would like to hear from Ms. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Well, first we got Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6099)|
| 1:41:40| He took care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:40| I thought Commissioner Finbar actually asked to hear from both parties why he had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| I didn't recall that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| So I will recognize Commissioner Saunders after Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| Commissioner Andrews took care of what I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| So Commissioner Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| Well, let's ask Barbara Kelly to come up and talk just a moment because, like I say, I was sufficiently confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| The figure that I saw that Mr. Rosenberg submitted was $235,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| I don't have the piece of paper in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| And you mentioned a much higher figure at the end of our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| And does this involve some other funds that we're not talking about on the table here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6138)|
| 1:42:24| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| Barbara Kelly at 5738 Sunrise Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| Actually, the funding that CAC currently has is made up of two types of federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6150)|
| 1:42:37| One is the home funds and the other is community development block grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| Our current funding is $933,000, which was composed of $288,000 in home and $645,000 in CDBG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6163)|
| 1:42:55| The home dollars, as part of the consolidated planning process, had already been moved from housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6175)|
| 1:43:03| and water and sewer projects to other priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| So as the planning process went through, the amount that was being proposed for CAC for those activities going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| forward was $550,000, which, of course, was a reduction, but we realized, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6195)|
| 1:43:23| that not all the funds that come into the county for these purposes can come for the purposes of home repair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| and water and sewer projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| So we were kind of okay with the $550,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| Then when the safety center funding proposal shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| and the idea was to take an additional $305,000 a year of CDBG block grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6222)|
| 1:43:51| and commit it for five years to the $1.5 million for the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6231)|
| 1:44:00| that was where there was going to be an additional reduction in CAC's funding for housing and water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:09| and sewer projects, bringing us to a total for next year of $345,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6249)|
| 1:44:17| which was where the significant reduction from what we're doing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| You know, it really doesn't make any difference to a low-income homeowner who lives in the county outside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6262)|
| 1:44:29| whose roof is leaking or whose septic tank is overflowing or who needs a heating system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6269)|
| 1:44:36| whether the money comes from Pot A or Pot B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| I mean, it only makes a difference, you know, to all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6279)|
| 1:44:43| And so it just seemed that on the bottom line, $345,000 going forward for five years was really asking the low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:56| homeowner, taxpaying citizen who lives in the county outside the city to just pick up too much of the burden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6296)|
| 1:45:04| for the safety center, which I personally and professionally have no objection to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| I mean, clearly I want to be clear that I certainly do not want mentally ill people to reside in the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6310)|
| 1:45:16| if they could more effectively and more efficiently and less expensively be treated otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| But I do really feel, and I appreciate the response that I've received from many of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6322)|
| 1:45:27| that that burden should not be, should not fall disproportionately upon one group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6327)|
| 1:45:37| who depend on this source of funding to meet their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| I hope that's clarified the, and I do support what Grant is proposing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6341)|
| 1:45:46| I think he and the Community Development Block Grant staff have done a really good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| of developing this five-year consolidated plan for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| They have provided all kinds of access for ideas to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| They work cooperatively with the city so that all of our time was spent in an efficient kind of a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6360)|
| 1:46:08| And I do appreciate the proposal that's being made by Grant Rosenberg now that we would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6368)|
| 1:46:15| so it would not have an immediate impact, at least for this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| and hopefully as planning for the safety center goes forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6379)|
| 1:46:23| we can think of a more equitable way to fund the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6383)|
| 1:46:28| And I do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:31| I have one question for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| For?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Ms. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| If you don't, I know, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Just while she was at the podium, I thought I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6399)|
| 1:46:41| You said that your reduction for the water sewer and the minor home repair was going to be a reduction of $305,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6401)|
| 1:46:50| I thought it was $205,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| Well, no, the total is $305,000 with $200,000 coming from CAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6413)|
| 1:46:59| and $100,000 coming from the money that was set aside for supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6419)|
| 1:47:05| Okay, so you're including the permanent supportive housing because that was $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| And if that's the case, I had a question for Grant because I thought he could find that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6430)|
| 1:47:17| They were going to be able to replace that from some other source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| that $100,000 that was to be eliminated for the permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| I'm sorry, I just caught the tail end of your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| Yeah, I know you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6448)|
| 1:47:30| I'm looking at the sheet that we got from the finance committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6450)|
| 1:47:33| and we're looking at the current proposal for CDBG funds going to the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| the potential amended proposal, and the permanent supportive housing lost $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6459)|
| 1:47:47| And I thought at finance committee you said that that money could be replaced from some other source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| It's not necessarily being replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| We have two sets of funds that we administer in our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| We have CDBG funds, which is the numbers that involve the Section 108 program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| and then we have home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| We get about $450,000 in home every year, home money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| And we actually had, we have planned in our proposal, our five-year comp plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| $100,000 out of CDBG and then $100,000 out of home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| for a total of $200,000 over the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| So $1 million over the next five years we have set aside for capital development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| If the Section 108 proposal were to move forward and be approved, as I would structure it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6506)|
| 1:48:34| it would take the $205,000 from our housing programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| and then the $100,000 out of CDBG for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| There would still be another $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| There would still be a half million over the next five years for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6523)|
| 1:48:48| Again, I was asked to put together what the proposal would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| You know, I guess the point I was trying to make is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| because I think the part that we're all concerned about are people that have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6534)|
| 1:48:58| the leaking roofs, the heating systems that are out, the sewer systems that are backing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6538)|
| 1:49:03| is that that reduction is actually $205,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6543)|
| 1:49:06| It would be under the Section 108 proposal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| For this program year, as it stands right now, as proposed, as Ms. Kelly mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6550)|
| 1:49:17| they are facing some cuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| We reallocated some money that traditionally had been for reconstruction program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| We're reallocating for affordable senior housing for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| So there's a little bit of a tradeoff there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6568)|
| 1:49:30| So their numbers did go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| We're going to go down anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| If Section 108 were to move forward, it would go down that much further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| First, I want to be clear that I think the safety center is something that is long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| It's something that the county should have done a long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| And I'm glad that it's going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| And I'm glad that it's moving forward in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| I think it's going to be a huge asset to the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| And I've been working with neighborhoods in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| And they see it that way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| My concerns have been about the money, how we're funding it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6605)|
| 1:50:12| using the CDBG funds that had been designated for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| However, I've talked with the ten-year plan people, and they are not concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| So, therefore, I'm not concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| I'm okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| I still do have a problem with if we do move forward with the Section 108,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| taking those funds away from Ms. Kelly's programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| You know, in the city, the home repairs are done by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| It comes out of the city money, not the county money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| So it really doesn't make any difference to my constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| But I think it makes a huge difference to the people who are outside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6643)|
| 1:50:49| who depend on that money, the most vulnerable of our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6649)|
| 1:50:53| And most of them are also, I believe, seniors who need these home repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| And I don't think, you know, I agree it's morally wrong to leave people who are mentally ill in the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| It's also morally wrong, I think, to take money away from programs that benefit our most vulnerable constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6665)|
| 1:51:13| So I would like to see this move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| I'd like to see the RFP happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| But I would really like when the time comes, and as Grant has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| if we do move forward with the Section 108, it's going to come back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| We're going to have to talk about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| We're going to have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| At that point, I think we need to get a little more creative about what kind of money we use to build this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| I think we also all need to realize that this is not a facility that will be owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6697)|
| 1:51:45| It will not be run by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| We're going to have to do a defined services contract with a private nonprofit to run this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6707)|
| 1:51:53| The other thing I'm concerned about, besides just the capital expense, but the ongoing operational expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6713)|
| 1:51:59| which is estimated to be at $1.7 million a year, that is not coming out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| or absorbed by any Knox County Department budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| That's something that we're going to have to come up with out of our pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| Now, eventually, there will be savings, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| But they will be savings that will come out of future budget increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6735)|
| 1:52:23| Nobody, no department in Knox County is going to be writing a check out of their savings to pay for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6743)|
| 1:52:32| This is not coming out of a county department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6752)|
| 1:52:36| We're going to have to come up with this, $1.7 million per year to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| I think it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| I just think that we need to be aware of that moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| and that's something that we need to really get into the details on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| because right now I don't see that we have that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| So we're going to need to think real seriously about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6772)|
| 1:52:56| But the concept, and I also want to ask our law director, this resolution, what are the legal ramifications?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6776)|
| 1:53:08| Are we just saying we think this is a great concept, we want to put out an RFP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| or does it legally require us to do anything beyond that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| No, ma'am, and right now it's endorsing the concept, so you're not committing funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| but you are moving forward beyond just the exploratory phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6801)|
| 1:53:25| and starting to now ultimately determine whether or not, A, you have the funds, and B, are you going to commit them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6805)|
| 1:53:31| So, and like I said, I think this is a great idea that's long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| We need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| We just need to be very careful about where the money is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6816)|
| 1:53:40| And before we commit to it, we need to make sure that the money is going to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| in future years to cover these operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6825)|
| 1:53:48| because this is not a facility that's going to be owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6828)|
| 1:53:51| We're spending our money building a facility for a private nonprofit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6831)|
| 1:53:55| and then we're going to have to hire someone to run it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| It's not going to be absorbed by a department in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| And as I said, their savings will eventually come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| They're not going to be immediate, but I think it will cut down on future budget increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| for the courts and for the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| But again, that's going to be in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| and it's still going to require us to write or to commit to very large payments for a defined services contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6856)|
| 1:54:24| So I just want to make sure that we're all aware of all those issues going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| and that this is something that we're going to have to come back to probably more than once before it actually happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6869)|
| 1:54:36| But we definitely want to keep moving, I think, in this direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| I see the sheriff here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Did you wish to address any of these items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| I also see General Nichols here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| I assume you're here on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| Sheriff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| You're ready for us to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| But you believe that there will be more than $1.7 million in savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| I think Dr. Briggs addressed that once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| I think in the long haul you will see that kind of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6904)|
| 1:55:07| I can tell you that Allison just told me the other day, my finance director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6907)|
| 1:55:10| that we had to transfer another $100,000 into pharmaceuticals for psychotropic drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6910)|
| 1:55:17| So now we're up around $600,000 for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| So that's just in the drugs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6920)|
| 1:55:22| That's just in the drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6922)|
| 1:55:23| And $197 a day for each mentally ill patient in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| So I see that everyone can see that there are going to be savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6927)|
| 1:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| And the commitment needs to be we need to keep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| And you had pledged that some of those savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| And that could free up money for Ms. Kelly, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6940)|
| 1:55:43| If there are savings and once we show there are savings, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| You can have whatever the savings are from my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6947)|
| 1:55:51| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| For JJ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| So you think that the savings will come out of future budget increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6956)|
| 1:56:04| Or are you saying that you'll be willing to put $1.7 million of your budget to pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6964)|
| 1:56:09| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| What I think this is the outcome of this will be is after the first year of its inception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| or maybe into the second year we'll be able to see exactly what it has saved Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| And I think that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| We're talking about that this is we're not talking about building it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6985)|
| 1:56:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6989)|
| 1:56:30| It's going to be a couple of years from now before we decide what we're going to do with that $1.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6990)|
| 1:56:35| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6995)|
| 1:56:36| How we're going to fund that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| I think the best part of it is that the Knox County taxpayers, if we do the 108 funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=6997)|
| 1:56:43| the Knox County taxpayers are not having to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| It's coming out of federal monies and federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| So we actually get the building from federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| and then we'll have to subsidize that $1.7 million hopefully two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| or three years down the road from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| Things will be better and we'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| But absolutely I pledge to you that any savings that it shows that we save money from the jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7020)|
| 1:57:06| or from our correctional facility, which as you know is about $34 million a year of my budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| I certainly wouldn't be opposed to putting that back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7031)|
| 1:57:15| So you're agreeing that it would be against future budget increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| Yeah, I don't think we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| I think we'll have to look at how much we've saved over the first year, year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7045)|
| 1:57:26| To have an idea of what we've saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7046)|
| 1:57:27| I don't think this is something on the front end you can say it's going to save you a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| Here take a million dollars out of my budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| I don't think you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| But ultimately after two or three years we will be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| I agree completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| It's just the first couple of years of getting it running that I'm concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| and then I want to make sure that we're all in agreement that the future funds are going to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7063)|
| 1:57:47| of future budget increases, not out of a department in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| It's not going to write a check for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I wouldn't think that would be so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| But I guess you would say to take away from Peter to pay Paul,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| if you don't have to increase my budget by another 1.5 million dollars, then you've saved 1.5 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7079)|
| 1:58:09| I'll put a question for Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| I was going to make one, you know, just one last reminder for anyone who hasn't heard this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7092)|
| 1:58:18| There are potentially a lot of savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7098)|
| 1:58:20| I know Commissioner Pinkston had some questions at the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| I thought they were very good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| But the potential savings from these are, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| 17 to 25 percent of the 1,100 prisoners that we have in our jail system are mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| and many of those people don't belong there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| It's really like the difference between keeping them in the Hyatt versus keeping them at a Motel 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7120)|
| 1:58:45| We can keep them at a much lower cost to the county by having them go to a safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| and we can also move them through the safety center a lot quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| And thirdly, we can get those people to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom100426part1?start=7134)|
