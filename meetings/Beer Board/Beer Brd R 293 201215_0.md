| 0:07:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=470)|

| 0:07:56| Shemino?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| This is Kenny Shemino with Fat Tuesday, 417 Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=486)|
| 0:08:08| Looks like your file still needs building inspection, fire prevention, health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| You did have a new background check in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| Can you tell us how you're doing with getting those approvals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Everything's working good now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| The owner of the building had to go in and make some repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=508)|
| 0:08:34| And we should get the space by January 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| And we should open up by April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| So we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Do you think that you, when do you think you'll be able to have everything done, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| in early January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Well, we just, we just going to start construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| They're going to get the vanilla box to us on January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=541)|
| 0:09:09| And hopefully six weeks from there, we will have it ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| Construction company is already logged up and ready to go on January 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Well, how much time do you think you do need to get everything completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=564)|
| 0:09:32| You think like 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Probably 90 days, hopefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| There's no way they'll need less than 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| So if we make a motion to extend 90 days, then they'll just come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| And we'll revisit it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| Because you, sir, you said you'll get vanilla box in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=593)|

| 0:09:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| For the build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=599)|
| 0:10:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| So you have your plans in review and approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| Are you just waiting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=607)|

| 0:10:11| We're all ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| All we've been waiting for is to get the space to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| I mean, we have everything ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=620)|
| 0:10:22| Everybody logged up to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=622)|

| 0:10:24| Approved and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Well, I guess we haven't typically given an extension longer than 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| Mr. Frost, can we give a longer amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| No, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| I would be unfamiliar with anything more than 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| I think 90 days would be good or very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| I mean, we should 90 days, we should be right at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| Or I can definitely come back and give you a date by in 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| If we're not open by 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| Well, I'll call on Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-201215?start=666)|
