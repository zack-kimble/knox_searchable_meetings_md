| 1:19:21| But they have enough question in their mind now to say, I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| And that's all we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| And so maybe an ad is an ad, but it also did a lot to help people to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4769)|
| 1:19:39| The truth is, if we do nothing else, we would argue that we develop the regulations that are going to become,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:46| and you vote the regulations and the ordinance at the same time you vote your slope protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4786)|
| 1:19:54| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| Mr. Donaldson, has anybody in your office began working on the regulations if the plan is adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| Do you have sketches or do you have anything drawn up preliminary currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| We've taken the opportunity in the plan to document several ordinances that we have worked on in other efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4812)|
| 1:20:23| such as a conservation subdivision ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| We have that kind of teed up and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4826)|
| 1:20:29| That's probably the farthest along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| We have been in the process of updating our subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| and in doing that have talked about and begin documenting alternative right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:43| and street cross sections that could be used in the hillside and slope protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| So there are some things that we have made progress on but haven't completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| What would it take to get the regs associated with the zonings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:03| You'll have to educate me because I'm not sure what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| I think the thought, I mean, we've got models to follow that you've depicted that have adopted hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| and ridgetop protection areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| You've got other cities that have done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| So I'm not so foolish to think that we haven't talked about the regulations that would come with this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| What would it take to get those regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| A rough draft, something that we could wrap our mind around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| and just kind of look and see what we're looking at because this is just a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| Well, the first step is to create policy to point you in the right direction on those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| Regulations can take many different forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| We can use the zoning ordinance to do some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| We can use the subdivision regulations to do some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| We can do freestanding design guidelines or regulations to do other parts of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:58| But you need a plan in place to point you in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| But if the plan was unamended as it sits now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| don't tell me that you don't have anything in mind what your ordinances would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| I mean, hopefully you've already looked at that down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| We've spent three years and $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| Hopefully we've gotten that far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| There are several that we have in mind, but they haven't been vetted in the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| If you think adopting a plan is difficult, wait until we move on to the regulatory process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| Well, I think that has a lot of people concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| because everybody knows that following a plan becomes regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| And if we just adopt a plan because it's just a plan, that's one thing about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4954)|
| 1:22:41| You know, I'm going to use a piece of property that we dealt with for a couple of months off Roge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| Sood Road, Mr. Sood bought some, I can't remember the guy's last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| but he bought a piece of property and we kind of used the 15% on a parcel by parcel basis very well there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4972)|
| 1:23:01| He's leaving the high grades alone and he's developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| on the other side I believe are townhouses on the other side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| So we have things in effect that are doing what the slope plan wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| Why can't we do it parcel by parcel every time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| We have in place since the general plan 2033 was adopted in 2003 the policies that guide us in rezoning cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| You can go down a path where it doesn't take a rezoning to trigger a look at new regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5013)|
| 1:23:43| or doesn't require the use of a planned residential zone district to kick in reforestation or revegetation activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:54| So there are many different paths that we can follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| We have been following the path of using planned districts formally since 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5037)|
| 1:24:04| and we actually used it far before that with a formula guided by the policy in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5044)|
| 1:24:12| that leads to the staff making a recommendation on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:16| Once we have that density established on a parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:19| then we can work with the developer to put that in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5059)|
| 1:24:25| And achieve many of the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:29| But what this plan does is package all of the incentives together in one place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| that can lead us to those carrots that everybody wants to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5075)|
| 1:24:40| They'd rather have carrots than sticks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| This is the first time that those have all been packaged together in one place to lead us in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| I think the size of this really scares a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| I mean, 62,000 parcels really scares a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| And I think if we went parcel by parcel, I think landowners would understand that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5095)|
| 1:25:05| one of them is 22% and this other guy over here is a totally different lay of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5105)|
| 1:25:12| but we figured it the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| Because we've already talked about 30% in Sevier County looks different than 30% in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| because of the way we figure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| And so there's going to be differences in each parcel that makes one parcel maybe unique to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| And I don't understand why we can't do parcel by parcel on the current plan that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5127)|
| 1:25:33| Well, essentially that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| The recommended policy is that some of these policies are applied only in the cases of rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5135)|
| 1:25:45| When you take a piece of property from its current ag zoning, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5145)|
| 1:25:50| which is 70% of the county that's outside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| to a residential zone district that's consistent with the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:59| we then use the policies to guide the recommendations on that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:05| The other policies or the other recommendations in the plan are a set of development incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| and a set of requirements that deal with how you treat the land after you mess with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:20| That's what we want to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| We already have in place the rezoning guidelines with the exception of the only changes is the land that's over 40%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5182)|
| 1:26:31| and that came from the engineering folks that were on the task force that said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| rational people don't go there anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| Like I said last Tuesday, economics is going to drive everybody off the ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| Once we start looking at that 60,000 parcels and drilling down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:50| we discover that 60% of them are two acres or less and already have a house on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| so those parcels really aren't affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| One of them is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| I'm not going to redevelop my piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| 97% of that 130,000 acres is designated in the current plans as low-density residential, agriculture or rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:17| so we're looking at low or extremely low densities to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| The other 3%, almost 2% of it, is what I would call the ridiculous industrial zoning that took place four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5242)|
| 1:27:33| that hasn't been developed where they simply zoned all the land within 1,000 feet of the railroad corridors to industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:40| so there's a whole bunch of that in the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| I know a guy that might argue that that's not ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:46| Well, he's got industrial zoning, and he doesn't have to mess with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:50| He can go right to the permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:54| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5277)|
| 1:28:01| Mark, this may not be possible, but this whole argument about regulations and plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:09| is there any way that you could go back over the last five years and tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| and it doesn't have to be tonight, but tell us how many plans have been adopted over the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5296)|
| 1:28:23| how many of them resulted in regulations, and I'm hearing that, oh, as soon as this plan is adopted, regulations are going to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:36| and I'm not certain that that's actually so, and I would like to hear from MPC on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5316)|
| 1:28:44| Also, I kind of feel like someone had mentioned that there were 63,000 people who aren't represented here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5324)|
| 1:28:54| and I'm assuming that they mean the people who hold these properties, these parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5334)|
| 1:29:01| but I could argue on the other side that there is another 387,000 people who aren't represented here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5341)|
| 1:29:10| because the comment that was made earlier, because we do live close together here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5350)|
| 1:29:20| and as we've seen as a result of today's rains, poor planning or no planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| or inappropriate development can affect and does affect every single person in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:35| and I really feel like the delay is good just for the fact that the majority of comments and calls that I've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5375)|
| 1:29:49| and a lot of the comments that I'm hearing are based on concerns that have arisen as a result of not understanding the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5389)|
| 1:30:02| perhaps being misinformed about certain details in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| and I do really feel like we've said that we already have policies guiding MPC in place for slopes greater than 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5409)|
| 1:30:23| and I think a lot of people don't realize that. They think this is something new. It's actually not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| And actually what this plan does is that it makes it possible to use updated current technology to make our current policies more accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:41| It doesn't do any dramatic changes, and it actually, in my opinion, makes our policies more accurate and more fairly applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:52| I also feel like the retirement home argument, there wouldn't be any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| That's an example I feel like people are misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| That would not the person who said, well, you know, there goes my plan for building my retirement home on, you know, my parcel of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5462)|
| 1:31:10| Actually, in that situation, that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5470)|
| 1:31:16| So I'm very, very concerned about the misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| I do know that it's the easiest way to defeat something is to make people afraid of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5481)|
| 1:31:28| and I feel like that has been happening, and I want to give everybody sufficient cooling off time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| and sufficient time to address any misinformation or true concerns that exist out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5495)|
| 1:31:42| So, Mark, I know I asked you a question, and then I didn't give you a chance to answer. I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| We actually, in Knox County and Knoxville, are fairly successful at implementing many of our plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5508)|
| 1:31:57| but it's the planner's dream that they actually get implemented, and we spend a lot of our time being frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5517)|
| 1:32:04| So the proverbial joke is that plans are for sitting on shelves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5524)|
| 1:32:10| So there is a track record of adopting plans and not implementing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| That being said, we do have many successes, and one of which would be the technology corridor along Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| which has an overlay zone district on it with relatively strict guidelines about working in the hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:32| and it is by far the most successful development area in Knox County outside of downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:40| So in that particular case, regulation has not been an impediment to good quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:47| Thank you. Also, this is off topic, but does anybody mind if I move this plant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| I can't see over it, and there's somebody sitting, a few people there that I didn't even realize were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5571)|
| 1:32:56| Can I move that? Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| How many commissioners does it take to, well, let's don't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| Does anyone else like to speak? Sir, would you like to address this? Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| My name is Mike Sullivan, 5506 Raccoon Valley, Knoxville 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5593)|
| 1:33:19| I didn't come here intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| I just wanted to get my thoughts, but I felt like there was a void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| I hadn't heard anybody stand up and say it's 62,999 who are not represented here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5607)|
| 1:33:35| My wife and I own 20-plus acres at Raccoon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| We would be affected, and I've heard developers and I've heard members of the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| and I hadn't heard anybody stand up and say I'm one of those 63,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| And just from listening tonight, because we've not been up to speed on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| several things, several thoughts that I think I'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| We are here because of the ad that was run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| It worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| It gave us a chance to look at what's being proposed and get involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:10| And I think the fact that it took the chamber to do that is the first thing that raises a little bit of a red flag to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| that says there's something wrong with the process, that we're three years into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| and it took the chamber to run that ad for us to say, oh, wait a minute, we may be affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| I think the second is these carrots are wonderful, all these development plans are wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5666)|
| 1:34:33| and those are great for the developers and they're great for the big picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5673)|
| 1:34:37| but they do nothing for the individual landowner when you're talking about saying there are restrictions here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| that are going to affect you that are not there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| I've heard it said this doesn't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| If it doesn't change anything, why are we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| If this is all out there, why are we doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| If these plans don't come to fruition, why have we spent $350,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| As a landowner and the one that's standing up to speak, those are the questions that come to mind here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| My father worked for the city for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| He was city traffic engineer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| I understand long-term planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| He spent 25 years serving the city doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| I know it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| But there's something about the process when it takes the chamber to step in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5717)|
| 1:35:21| to get the kind of e-mails that you guys have gotten, that you've spent that kind of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| and this is where we are in the night of the vote that is of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| I don't know enough about the plan to be for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| I have a problem with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| And I think somebody needed to stand up for those $63,000 and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5739)|
| 1:35:46| Yes, could we have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| My name is Jamie Dobbs, and I live at 2509 Lakefront Drive in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| I'm the current president of the League of Women Voters of Knoxville and Knox County with 176 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5754)|
| 1:36:01| League of Women Voters, and there are several of us here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| we urge you to support the Hillside Ridge Top Protection Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| and its balance of development and conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| We ask you to please give credence to the rational process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| and the balanced group of people that deliberated over this plan for now over two years ago and three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:24| And as someone who is trained in planning, I know plans don't call for notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| They do not have the force of law, and they're not considered a taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| And just because some have said the opposite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| and inspire unwarranted fear in the public is no justification to abandon this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| and $300,000 of well-spent public money and untold hours of staff and volunteer time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5804)|
| 1:36:53| This was a well-developed plan, and it was not haphazardly developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5813)|
| 1:36:59| It had considerations from all quarters, from the developers, from neighbors and planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:07| And all of those folks were represented in the creation of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| And the incentives for developers, it does have the incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5833)|
| 1:37:18| at the same time that it protects the land and nearby neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| And I have to say, I am one of those people that lives on a slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| and have been affected by development above me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| I've had to call the county out numerous times on my own property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| to have stormwater ordinances enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| So I also know about this personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| So we call on you to make decisions based on fact and the greater good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| and support this plan that was long debated and ultimately supported by MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| with an unequivocal 11-2 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| We ask you to vote on behalf of the long-term interest of our economy and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5873)|
| 1:37:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5879)|
| 1:38:03| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:06| I would just like to save my comments for the end when people are finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| Other folks like to address us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| Steve Drevick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| I live at 5801 Meadow Glen Drive here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| I was asked actually to re-letter from Tanya Drum, a previous resident of Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| And I'll just kind of go ahead and read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| But as a little background, Mrs. Drum lived in the Forest Ridge Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| which, if you're not familiar, were partially destroyed by a mudslide in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:46| Her letter goes, Dear Commissioners, I was the victim of the man-made mudslide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| that has complicated my life since February 14, 2003, at Forest Ridge Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| I still suffer effects of post-traumatic stress disorder every time there's a powerful storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5939)|
| 1:39:05| I actually had issues this morning at home when the storms came through my new home in Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| I was anxious and fearful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| I will never forget the panic, anxiety, and terror when I had to leave my home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| as a man-made mudslide overcame my world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| My anxiety increased as I learned that my neighbor, Dr. Anthony Justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| was trapped inside his home, covered over with the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| You cannot imagine the sounds and smells as the building collapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| It's a memory I will never forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| I could only hope at that time that Anthony would survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| God bless him as he copes with his pain every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| He lost, I believe, one of his legs, had to be amputated after being extracted from the mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5985)|
| 1:39:52| She goes on, this incident could have been prevented 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| if attention had been given to the unsteady hillside slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| I would look behind my building at the time and think, before the mudslide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| that doesn't look right, and me, I only practice in dentistry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| Please, let's prevent this tragedy from ever repeating itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| When you vote, stop, close your eyes, take a breath,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| and remind yourself that lives are potentially at stake with your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| I think this letter says volumes about the necessity for us taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:27| to properly understand the plan and not rushing into the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| and not subjecting ourselves to fear and misinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| I think a delay would be vastly warranted, and I think both the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| and the public needs to understand more about the plan and its implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| Yes, name and address of a record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| Deborah Buckner Sullivan, also at 5506 Raccoon Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| And I'll be short and sweet, but my problem with this situation is kind of a broader span of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6056)|
| 1:41:03| it's a very slippery slope when you start talking about people's ownership of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| I've worked my whole life to be 50 years old to buy a piece of property that I want to leave to my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| I've got an 80-year-old father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| And to think that someone's going to say you can or cannot build or it's more of an overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| I don't think anyone up there would want someone to come into your life and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| well, I don't like the way your detached garage looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| Now, after the fact, we've already bought this property, and to say all of a sudden my use for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6091)|
| 1:41:37| is going to be dictated by someone that, like he just said, has moved to Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| and it's unfortunate that a landslide affected her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| But we're the ones that, you know, we're going forward with this is America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:51| I mean, I think Mr. McKenzie said, you know, this is the United States or this is, you know, America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6111)|
| 1:41:58| And I just think you have to be very careful when you start for a few people or a tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| start controlling what someone's life is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| I mean, anyway, that's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6131)|
| 1:42:19| Yes, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6139)|

| 1:42:25| The Council of West Knox County Homeowners has voted to support the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| I'm currently the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| I'll be stepping down in April, so I figured I'd get this on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| So our next president won't have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| Council's mission statement asks that we work to encourage government to develop sound development practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| and to encourage environmental conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| This protection plan does both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| We sent this email to commissioners, and I wanted to make sure it was part of the official record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| I'll give that to somebody afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6174)|
| 1:43:00| Our letter contained aerial photos of highly visible areas which have been clear-cut for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| I thought it very interesting that three landmarks of West Knox County, Cedar Bluff, Rocky Hill, and Bearden Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| currently show the results of the lack of restrictions on the development of our hillsides and ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| The negative impact on the environment, the air, the water, the flora, and the fauna is irreversible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:27| The question of taking a property has no validity in relation to the opposition to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6207)|
| 1:43:32| This is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| I recall the Pirates of the Caribbean discussing the Pirates' Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| and the young woman was arguing her safety, and they said, you know, this isn't the rule, this isn't the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6219)|
| 1:43:47| this is just kind of a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| Well, this is a guideline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| There is due process for the further development of restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| This is the early stages, as you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| Enough is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Please better manage what's left of our natural landscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| and we ask that the, I guess, the delay be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| and hopefully in the future the plan be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6262)|
| 1:44:30| Did you send that to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| You were talking about the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| We need that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Oh, do you have a copy of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:36| Okay, if we could have that, if you wouldn't mind bringing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| We need that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| Would anyone else like to address the Commission on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6281)|
| 1:44:45| Yes, yes, sir, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| My name is Ron Shreves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| I'm an executive committee member of the Harvey Broom Group of the Tennessee chapter of the Sierra Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| The Harvey Broom Group welcomes the opportunity to provide comments on the subject plan on behalf of our members residing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:07| I make these remarks both as a member of the Harvey Broom Group, and they also reflect my personal convictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:16| Our executive committee has submitted a separate letter to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6316)|
| 1:45:20| First, on a personal note, the quality of life and natural beauty of East Tennessee is what drew my wife| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| and I here to Knox County from Los Angeles about 38 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| As a permanent resident of this county, I hope to see the attractive surroundings in which we live preserved to the extent practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| as such will have a lasting impact on the value of real property, including my own, which is not on a slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| and on the quality of life enjoyed by residents of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6346)|
| 1:45:51| The Harvey Broom Group commends the members of the task force for the dedication and efforts in drafting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| The process has been lengthy, sometimes contentious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| We believe the deliberations involved both adequate provision for public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| and employed the expertise of professionals necessary to sound policy formulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| We also believe the plan submitted by the task force and recommended by MPC is a good first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| towards assuring enhancement of property values generally, as well as the preservation of remaining green spaces in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:27| And I want to emphasize the point that was made earlier that people who don't live on property with a 15% or higher slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:36| are also affected by this, and their property values are affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6396)|
| 1:46:42| Rather than dwell on well-rehashed details of the development plan, although this evening maybe it's apparent that they're not so well-rehashed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:52| but I'd like to make two brief points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| As pointed out on page 19 of the protection plan, the recommended policy is consistent with established objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| stated in the 2033 general plan as approved in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| And I'll quote from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| Ridges should be preserved for wildlife and plant habitat as part of our respect and nurturing of Knoxville and Knox County's heritage areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:19| And again, the spirit of that statement I think can be expanded to reflect that the well-being of wildlife and plant habitat affects property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:38| It affects the quality of life in an area, which of course is then reflected in the desire to live in that area and in property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6458)|
| 1:47:48| The second point I want to make is that the same logic that supports any zoning regulation generally also supports the hillside and ridge top policies proposed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6468)|
| 1:48:00| Of course this plan will affect property values as any policy does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:06| Most property values will be enhanced by the proposed policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| The fact that a relatively few property values may be reduced is what makes your job a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6490)|
| 1:48:17| And I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| But it's also precisely why the citizens of Knox County rely on your collective judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| And we do trust that the extra time that you may be taking to consider this plan will pay off both for everyone here and for the commission members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6506)|
| 1:48:39| I'd also like to maybe briefly allude to the flooding that we observed today, which should, at least in my untrained mind, reflect the importance of considering a 15% slope as something that perhaps needs more regulation or different regulation than flat land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6519)|
| 1:49:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| Yes, the name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| Patricia Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6552)|
| 1:49:16| Actually, I had sent an e-mail yesterday and the e-mail did not get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| So I just want to put this on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| Who do I turn these into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| And I am in support of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6568)|
| 1:49:36| We'll take those here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6576)|
| 1:49:57| If you need some more copies over there, let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| I may not have divided them up correctly, but this is her statement that she's given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:05| I'll go to the Commissioner's lights here in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6605)|
| 1:50:08| I'm going to get Mr. Burr first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| If you wouldn't mind, give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| Gene Burr, 3621 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| Mr. Chairman, I just want to acknowledge an error in my own presentation out of respect for Mike Edwards and the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:21| The discrepancy that had been pointed out to me between the degrees on a compass and the percentage of slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6621)|
| 1:50:29| which was pointed out to me, I jumped the gun at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6629)|
| 1:50:35| It looked like it had been misrepresented in the Chamber ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:42| What was presented was accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6642)|
| 1:50:47| And I thought just as a matter of to begin this civil discourse that will lead up to the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6647)|
| 1:50:55| I should acknowledge that that was an error on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| I appreciate your time, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6660)|
| 1:51:07| Yes, sir, name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6667)|
| 1:51:09| Dan Evans, 8334 Richland Colony Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6669)|
| 1:51:16| I'm a realtor and a real estate investor and a part owner in a real estate company here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6676)|
| 1:51:22| And I've been at it for several years, and the last few years have been pretty challenging in the real estate industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6682)|
| 1:51:30| And I just wanted to say, you know, from our perspective, please don't enact something that is going to deflate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:41| or hurt property values right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| We just can't handle it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| I mean, it's not the right time for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| Maybe three years ago when this started, a little different mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| I do believe that restrictions can be passed that don't necessarily hurt property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:55| The gentleman just before me said, no, this is going to really help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| You guys are, you know, you're the ones we've selected to make these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6719)|
| 1:52:04| And make sure that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| You know, make sure that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| And if not, 60 days from now is not going to be much better, really, with respect to that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:14| I have an engineering background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6734)|
| 1:52:16| To me, 15 percent seems overreaching, and 63,000 parcels sounds like a lot of parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:23| So, you know, please just do what you can for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| We're out there doing our best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| It's a really tough time in real estate, and it's frustrating sometimes when our government can make things harder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6747)|
| 1:52:35| whether that's federal or local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| So I think that the economic impact in the short term definitely needs to be factored in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6757)|
| 1:52:45| I mean, if it's to save lives and some of the things I've heard, I mean, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| But please don't forget us out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| We're trying to just get the bills paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6774)|
| 1:52:59| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| Polly Doka, 4804 Tamachi Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| I've listened to both sides, and hopefully we can come to a compromise that actually improves development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6785)|
| 1:53:14| If we have quality development in Knox County and Knoxville, we're going to have increased property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:21| The people downstream do matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| I lived in eastern Kentucky, and when I moved there, you could not walk across the river behind my house because it would be over your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6804)|
| 1:53:34| Two years later, after strip mining, and I'm not comparing our development here to strip mining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:40| but two years after I moved to this place, you could walk across the river and the water was up to your knees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:48| But, again, bad development does not increase our tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6828)|
| 1:53:54| It does not increase our property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| And I don't mean to say that developers are kind of like the joke about lawyers that 90% of them give the other 10% a bad name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:08| However, you know, it's kind of like childbirth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6848)|
| 1:54:12| When you have someone that has a really hard time, you hear all those stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:16| But when someone doesn't, you don't hear the stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| So you do hear the stories about the bad developers instead of the good developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| The good developers should not have any problem looking at this plan and seeing what is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| and if necessary, if they need to add to it or change some of the percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| I think we've had a lot of good input here with the NPC commissioners and NPC and task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| So hopefully we can come to a compromise and make sure that all the development in Knox County and Knoxville is good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6883)|
| 1:54:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:57| Would anyone else like to address us before I go to commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6899)|
| 1:55:00| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| Dan Garrigan, PO Box 20084, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37940.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6903)|
| 1:55:08| I spoke at your last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| I found out about this whole plan shortly before I guess it was one of the final meetings that they had in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6912)|
| 1:55:21| and spoke there, too, and Commissioner Anders, I believe, had a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6921)|
| 1:55:26| and that is if we're already doing all the things that this plan envisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| that why don't we just say, look, they've done $350,000 worth of work to look at what other places have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:40| and how it's worked out for them, and basically this is a good way to do it and this is not a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:47| And they've collected a lot of good data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| They have a lot of GIS capability now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| You're already taking these site by site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| And so if you created a best management practices plan rather than have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6958)|
| 1:56:05| even if this is going to be hashed out further, which is going to cost more time and more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| then you're going to have another session where you're going to have to actually create the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| You're going to have to fight over the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| If you just said, we know what works, we know what doesn't, we know, you know, a hill is too steep to build on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:25| and a lot of the people who are the developers or whoever is here, you're not necessarily attacking their property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6985)|
| 1:56:33| They will be dealt with by the MPC and by this body on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| And then at least they'll know that they've had a fair hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| If all these individuals that have no idea about what is going on with this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| and I've read the plan and I've spoken before the council and I've spoken before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7010)|
| 1:56:56| and it really bothers me because everybody seems to think, and as this woman over here said, it's our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7016)|
| 1:57:04| We've spent our lives working for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| We pay our taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| And now the government, who is supposed to be there to protect us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| seems to be doing things that we don't understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| and we don't even understand what it may do to us 10 or 15 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| But I think if you could create a set of best management practices plans and just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7044)|
| 1:57:30| look, you're not going to stick a house on a 60% slope or a 60-degree slope or whatever it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7050)|
| 1:57:39| unless you do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| But you shouldn't have to tell people what color their shingles are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| and what kind of plants they've got to put in and all this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| And I believe that you would get a lot more support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| You would not have to necessarily notify all the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| because you're not doing anything differently than what you have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| And that is what really bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| And I am a Landover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| I believe it will impact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7090)|
| 1:58:11| But the thing that really bothered me when I heard about it at first was that the cavalier attitude,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7091)|
| 1:58:17| was that the MPC and this body, nobody really takes into account that these ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7097)|
| 1:58:24| and the hillside belong to 62,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| It doesn't belong to the whole community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| I'm not going to get my life back if you tell me that my property above 50% is worthless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7110)|
| 1:58:36| And that, I think, would be a good compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| Let's just look at every individual case on a case-by-case basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7119)|
| 1:58:44| use the information that they have provided in this report to create a best management practices plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7124)|
| 1:58:51| and take everything on a case-by-case basis, and you wouldn't have the threat of lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| Because at least on an individual basis, you could decide whether you wanted to take up a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7137)|
| 1:59:02| But if you're going to have to now generate some, you have the plan and you're going to have to generate regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7142)|
| 1:59:09| you're going to have to fight over the regulations, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| And that's going to be a whole other fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| And so I say, why not just codify, or not codify it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| but make a best management practices plan out of the information they gathered and drive on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7158)|
| 1:59:24| Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7164)|
| 1:59:30| A number of commissioners have their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| And so if anyone else wants to speak, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| But Commissioner Owenby, I'll begin with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| Commissioner Wright, who wants to be first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| I'll be happy to plow right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7182)|
| 1:59:44| That means I can get to nap earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7184)|
| 1:59:49| This is the thing that was just handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| Property that is already developed will see no effect from this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7194)|
| 2:00:00| Mark, I believe you hit on that earlier when you said your piece of property that you currently live on will see no impact from this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7200)|
| 2:00:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| Starting with that 60,000 parcel number, when we look at them a little closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7212)|
| 2:00:21| I think it was 60% of them were two acres or less with a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| Those parcels are not candidates for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7227)|
| 2:00:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| So we've already plowed some of this ground earlier this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7234)|
| 2:00:41| And the east sector plan, I really want to, you know, I thought we would be in agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7241)|
| 2:00:49| But the next one is a quiz because I don't know the correct answer on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| The next sentence, nor will any residential property with slope under 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7253)|
| 2:01:02| because the guideline in the plan for that property are the ones that we're using currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| No density change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| No, it just says guidelines here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| And I've seen this in two or three or four different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7274)|
| 2:01:19| Residential property with a slope under 40% will not be affected because it's the same rules that we're using right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7279)|
| 2:01:29| The current policy that guides staff in making a recommendation on residential rezonings in the slope protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7289)|
| 2:01:39| is that for slopes less than 15%, we use the low density residential factor or the ag rural residential factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7299)|
| 2:01:50| which is five units to the acre or one unit to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| On slopes between 15% and 25%, we use two units to the acre, except in the ag and rural residential there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7315)|
| 2:02:04| And on slopes greater than 25%, then we use one dwelling unit per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7324)|
| 2:02:13| What the new recommended policy is to further subdivide that greater than 25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7333)|
| 2:02:24| and to take it to a smaller factor for over 40% and a zero factor for over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7344)|
| 2:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7353)|
| 2:02:34| Leave all those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| I just want to look at the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| 40% down to 15% in residential, it's the same as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7357)|
| 2:02:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7365)|
| 2:02:46| In the new plan, it's the same as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7368)|
| 2:02:52| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| I've seen this in three or four different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| Different people may be using the same fact, and I just wanted to make sure that I was reading that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7376)|
| 2:03:05| I didn't keep track of whose lights were on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| I'm just going to go around if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| Commissioner Brown, then we'll move over to this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| Very quickly, there's been a lot of questions raised today, a lot of statements made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7393)|
| 2:03:21| Some were accurate, some were not totally accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7401)|
| 2:03:25| Mark, are these still available through MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| It is available on our website to be downloaded by individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| We do not have a great number of paper copies available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| I would like to encourage anybody who plans on coming to the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7418)|
| 2:03:42| if you can't get a copy of this, download it and study it before you come to the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7422)|
| 2:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7427)|
| 2:03:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Mr. Donaldson, how many parcels are there altogether in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7437)|
| 2:04:03| Can you tell me that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| To a nice round number, 190,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7448)|
| 2:04:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| Actually, what you're saying is that due to parcels that have already been developed, this does not apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7452)|
| 2:04:20| We say it applies to 63,000, but in actuality it only applies to 40% of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7460)|
| 2:04:30| The number may be even considerably less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7470)|
| 2:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| It would only apply if someone wishes to redevelop their land in accordance with the land use plan that's been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7474)|
| 2:04:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| So pretty much it's not 63,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| It's considerably less because parcels that have already been developed don't count unless they want to be redeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7489)|
| 2:04:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| And that 60% number is the number of parcels that are so small with an existing house on it that there's nothing to be gained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7500)|
| 2:05:09| From redeveloping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| From redeveloping, and redeveloping would be inconsistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7514)|
| 2:05:15| I think that's a very important point for everyone to keep in mind, that technically it may say 63,000, but in actuality it's only 40% of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7515)|
| 2:05:28| And that's a very, very small percentage of the total parcels in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| I also want to say that in terms of best management practices, I think the task force would argue that that's what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7533)|
| 2:05:41| They have looked around the country and they've put together best practices, and that's what this plan is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7541)|
| 2:05:48| I also want to try to allay some of this fear that, like I said, has come out of this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7548)|
| 2:05:54| No one is talking about taking anyone's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7554)|
| 2:05:58| And the concerns that we're regulating and regulating, if you own land in Knox County, your land is already regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7558)|
| 2:06:07| It's already zoned, and there are only certain things that you are allowed to do, even at this point, on your land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| So it's not that we are, this is, I feel like we're, I'm sorry, it's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7574)|
| 2:06:26| I really feel like that argument is one that's been made to scare people, and that's just simply not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7586)|
| 2:06:36| There's also been, I've heard that if, and we've just reiterated with Commissioner Wright that slopes between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7596)|
| 2:06:45| or regulations or policies between slopes from 15 to 40 percent, nothing changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| And I feel like people keep harping on this 15 percent, 15 percent, 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| and I'd really hope that everyone could understand that that is not a viable argument because this doesn't change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7616)|
| 2:07:05| And I've heard the argument, if it doesn't change anything, why do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| The simple answer, my understanding, is that previously slope and elevation was determined by a hand-drawn line on a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7628)|
| 2:07:18| And no offense to the people who drew those lines, but the current technology we have right now means that we can make those lines more accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7638)|
| 2:07:30| and that this actually, what it does, it refines our plan and makes it more accurate and more fairly applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7650)|
| 2:07:40| And I would also argue that for every person who is saying that their property is going to be devalued by this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7660)|
| 2:07:48| I can guarantee you I can find at least one person who can say that their land has been devalued from surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7668)|
| 2:07:59| where there's been poorly planned, poor planning or no planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7679)|
| 2:08:03| and they've had to deal with stormwater runoff, with all kinds of problems on their property that has lowered their property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7683)|
| 2:08:14| So it's, you know, it's not just one side that is worried about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7694)|
| 2:08:22| The other side is also concerned about their property being devalued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| So, I mean, I would like to say I appreciate the work that the task force has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| and I really do appreciate everyone who's come out tonight to speak on this issue and who's contacted us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| I appreciate it tremendously when the citizens of Knox County let us know how they feel on an issue, good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7719)|
| 2:08:48| I really do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| Commissioner Olde.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7735)|
| 2:08:59| Since this is just a plan and anybody, we can, we're the body that can change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7739)|
| 2:09:05| We can make a suggestion, send it back to MPC since they've already approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| I'm going to make a substitute motion that we go to 25% with landowner notification of the ones affected and send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7751)|
| 2:09:30| So we have a motion on the floor. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| So your motion would be, restate it again, you said 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7773)|
| 2:09:38| Yes, 25% or greater with landowner notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7778)|
| 2:09:44| Who would notify?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7784)|
| 2:09:46| That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7786)|
| 2:09:47| I mean, we need to specify that because there will be costs involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7787)|
| 2:09:51| I would say MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| And we may have to, I mean, we'll talk about the funding of that if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7794)|
| 2:09:58| And then you said send it back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| To make the necessary changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| To make necessary changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7804)|
| 2:10:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| And second is agreeable to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7807)|
| 2:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7808)|
| 2:10:09| So we have a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7809)|
| 2:10:11| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7811)|
| 2:10:12| Oh, did you have anything else, Commissioner Olde?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| Okay, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7815)|
| 2:10:17| I want to really to start by, you know, thanking the MPC, the people that were on the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| because they've really had a tough job over the past three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7824)|
| 2:10:27| They have spent a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| They've spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| And there's some really good ideas in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| There's some things that I think need to be tweaked, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| possibly the development of this 15 to 25 percent slope, some of the tax implications, property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7838)|
| 2:10:43| I don't want to go over those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7843)|
| 2:10:44| We've spent two hours going over all that right now, and I'll let somebody else, you know, fight those battles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7844)|
| 2:10:51| That said, I want to bring up something that's not been talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| And it's something that I have some of the most serious reservations about the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| And I really want not necessarily an answer tonight, but let the parties think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7861)|
| 2:11:08| and try to get some answers when we have our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| They deal not with the plan itself, but with us as an elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| and how the plan will be enforced and implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7877)|
| 2:11:21| For the hillsides and ridgetop plan to work, the whole plan must be adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7881)|
| 2:11:28| accepted, and implemented in its entirety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| not just the parts that certain task force members and certain commissioners like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7891)|
| 2:11:36| The plan is based on the premise that the professional MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7896)|
| 2:11:42| through thoughtful research investigations, have developed a wise plan that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7902)|
| 2:11:48| In summary, we save our ridges and hilltops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| and allow incentives for development at a higher density on flatter terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| I think everyone would agree that's what the plan's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| The proponents of the plan refer to this as wise and appropriate use of Knox County land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| The problem is I don't believe that even the most ardent supporters of the plan really believe in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7928)|
| 2:12:15| Let me give you several real-life examples about what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7935)|
| 2:12:21| Two months ago, the thoughtful professional staff of the MPC presented a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7941)|
| 2:12:28| to allow a business park along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| The MPC presented the plan as wise and an appropriate use of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7951)|
| 2:12:36| This is a business park on an interstate interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| Tonight we've talked about $300,000 spent on the hill slope and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| What about the $10 million and five years spent at Midway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7966)|
| 2:12:52| The MPC's decision and recommendation was voted down as wrong, inappropriate and misguided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7972)|
| 2:13:01| by members of the task force and some of the strongest opponents of the business park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7981)|
| 2:13:06| now laud the wisdom of the present MPC plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7986)|
| 2:13:11| I couldn't help but notice that two of the task force members that now strongly endorse the hillside and ridgetop plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7991)|
| 2:13:17| of allowing denser residential development are the same ones that just two months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=7997)|
| 2:13:22| were ardently against any sewer system in East Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8002)|
| 2:13:27| What I'd like to know, has there now been a change of opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8007)|
| 2:13:31| If not, I would like to know how we're going to allow incentives of denser residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8011)|
| 2:13:38| without building a sewer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| How are we going to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| A little over a year ago, we rejected an MPC plan in South Knox County to allow high-density residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8024)|
| 2:13:51| when the developer wanted to use a tool called transfer of developmental rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8031)|
| 2:13:57| which would preserve hillsides and green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| It was soundly rejected by this commission because of considerable citizen objection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| and essentially identical tool is permitted in the hillside and ridgetop plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8046)|
| 2:14:10| for a conservation easement and dense housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8050)|
| 2:14:14| My point of all this isn't to refight past battles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| They're finished. I accept them. They're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| But it is a fundamental political fact that a political body should and does bend to citizen pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8060)|
| 2:14:27| I do not see the ordinary citizens of Knox County accepting parts of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| such as a large sewer system in East Knox County, in order to support high-density residential environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8071)|
| 2:14:39| I don't see other neighborhoods in Knox County supporting high-density residential developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8079)|
| 2:14:45| where we have low residential developments already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| We've tried that before and there's a lot of citizen objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8088)|
| 2:14:55| And the commission and members of the same people that are advocating this will yield to the citizen pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8095)|
| 2:15:03| and then the whole plan fails because we have no development anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8103)|
| 2:15:09| Just as a final word, I'd like to say we've got to have affordable housing for our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| We've got to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| I may work in a place where I have contact with a lot of people who are low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8117)|
| 2:15:21| and middle-income workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| A lot of those no longer live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| I see people every day that live in Claiborne County, Campbell County, and even Middlesbrough, Kentucky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8126)|
| 2:15:32| that commute back and forth to Knoxville because they can't find affordable housing for their families in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8132)|
| 2:15:41| What we have to do is we have to find a way to reconcile this plan and we have to accept the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8141)|
| 2:15:49| Taking the parts that we like or people who are advocating this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8149)|
| 2:15:52| taking the parts that we like about preserving the hill slopes and the ridge tops is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8152)|
| 2:15:58| but we're going to have to accept the rest of the plan, which is dense housing on flatter terrain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8158)|
| 2:16:04| which means we're going to have sewer plants, we're going to have dense housing in low-dense residential neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8164)|
| 2:16:13| and see if people are willing to accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| I don't know, but this is something that's going to have to be addressed if we accept the whole plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8175)|
| 2:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| I stand to remind you of the box that the state legislature has put you in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| in that before you can compromise, you have to not compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8189)|
| 2:16:36| The Planning Commission has adopted this plan as part of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8196)|
| 2:16:41| Your role on the agenda this evening is to make it operative or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| I withdraw my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| If you choose to not make it operative, then you can move on to step two by initiating, by resolution, your compromise plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8210)|
| 2:17:02| But it is a multi-step process that has been adopted by the state legislature since mid-2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8222)|
| 2:17:11| comparable to what we went through with the East County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| Mr. Owen Behear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Yes, I remove that motion, but I do want to make a second motion that we vote on this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| I think postponing it for 60 more days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8243)|
| 2:17:25| Substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8247)|
| 2:17:29| So your substitute motion, then, is to vote on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8249)|
| 2:17:33| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| So motion and second is to vote on the plan this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| I want to get this gentleman, and then we'll go to Mission Managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8260)|
| 2:17:41| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| Rocky Smith, 4909 Ball Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8263)|
| 2:17:47| I just want to clarify a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8267)|
| 2:17:49| When the questions were asked about this is exactly the same, 40% below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8269)|
| 2:17:56| you've got to remember how you ask the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| You ask about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| There is clearing regulations now in this that will be much more restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| I watched this plan be put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| A lot of the things are the same, but when you get into the nuts and bolts of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| the clearing regulations, as you go up those slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| when you get to where you can only clear 20% or 15%, you cannot develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8293)|
| 2:18:18| So the zoning may be the same, but it's not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8298)|
| 2:18:23| And when we talk about, Commissioner Burrell is about this is the exact same property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8303)|
| 2:18:27| there's 29,000 acres that are zero to 15%, under 15%, that is in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8307)|
| 2:18:33| That is not currently the same as we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8313)|
| 2:18:37| It only addresses 15% above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| There's 29,000 acres that are 15% below that are under this slope protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8319)|
| 2:18:45| that have to fall under these same guidelines, clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| and all these other things that is not the same today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| So when we say all these things are exactly the same, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| And when you address that these others aren't affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| then why are we putting them even in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8337)|
| 2:18:59| Why do we just leave them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8339)|
| 2:19:00| If they're not affected and they're not, just leave them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8340)|
| 2:19:02| That's things like that that I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8342)|
| 2:19:04| When we say they're not affected, then why do we have them in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8344)|
| 2:19:08| The 40% you talk about, let's just have them leave them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| and then we can affect 20,000 or 30,000 property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| Yes, ma'am, your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8356)|
| 2:19:20| Rachel Craig, 2222 Allen Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8360)|
| 2:19:22| I want to be very clear about what I said about zero to 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| and what I think other people have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| And that is the density recommendations from zero to 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8370)|
| 2:19:37| for low-density residential are the same in the plan as what the staff uses now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8377)|
| 2:19:44| We didn't say everything is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| We said the density provisions were exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8387)|
| 2:19:53| So let's be clear on, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8393)|
| 2:19:56| I don't want to be accused of saying something that I didn't say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| because I was very careful to say it accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| So I just want to make sure you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8405)|
| 2:20:07| Yes, sir, your name and address again for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8407)|
| 2:20:09| My name is Lonnie Harris, 2535 Old Callaghan Drive, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| Ms. Boyles, you made the comment a few minutes ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| that you didn't know anybody who was positively affected by these cuts in the hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8417)|
| 2:20:24| or you implied that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| I live or have property right next door to the poster child for all this controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8426)|
| 2:20:34| I live next door to Knoxville Wholesale Furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8434)|
| 2:20:38| Now, in the short term, it probably isn't going to help my property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8438)|
| 2:20:42| Long term, it definitely will help the value of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8442)|
| 2:20:47| And if these regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110228part2?start=8447)|
