| 0:01:36| Our first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Deferred application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=98)|

| 0:01:57| Anyone at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| Mr. Law Director, I'm wondering if we could just withdraw this from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| From what I understand, there are some issues with this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| If we could just withdraw it, and then once they're ready to come back before us, they can come back before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=124)|
| 0:02:11| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| There are some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| That's why it was deferred last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| You can do that if you wish, or you could act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| They are not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| We've put it off three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| I'd like just to withdraw it off the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=146)|
| 0:02:33| Wouldn't it be better just to deny it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| You can do either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| To withdraw it, I mean, is it going to come back up at a certain time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=158)|
| 0:02:48| You'd recommend that we go ahead and act on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Then I'll withdraw my motion then and ask that we deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=171)|
| 0:02:54| There's been a first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=175)|

| 0:04:37| Is it Paul Harrison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| That sounds right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| It's on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=282)|

| 0:04:52| And as General Manager and a person applying for this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=292)|

| 0:05:21| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| As I understand it, sir, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| you also wish to have a permit to sell beer at your swimming pool location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| We don't actually sell it at the swimming pool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| but just so we're covered if somebody buys one and takes it to the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=338)|
| 0:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=342)|
| 0:05:47| Swimming pool not being under roof, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| It's outdoor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=352)|
| 0:05:56| You would need to, I mean, basically that's treated as a separate location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=356)|
| 0:06:05| and you would need to submit another application for that if that's what you wish to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| We thought about making this a request for both on and off premise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| but for off premise they have to take the alcohol off the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| I mean, that is the law, so that won't help you any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Unfortunately, you'll need to get a permit for both locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| So this is for indoors, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| And swimming season is just over with, so you've got a couple of months to go ahead and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| It may not be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| Where is this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| Again, it's on Peters Road, but what's it next to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| It's actually off Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Oh, Emory Road, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=403)|

| 0:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| Did I hear a motion for approval pending the reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=423)|

| 0:08:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Okay, we have all 11 members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| This month the devotional will be by Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=508)|
| 0:08:38| Last year at this time, about the same time of the year, I was asked to do the devotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| and I quoted some of Psalm 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| And in Psalm 18, of course, it's basically a prayer for strength, for guidance, for refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=528)|
| 0:09:01| I think a lot of that's appropriate again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| And two touchstone psalms for me are 16 and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=543)|
| 0:09:10| And so I'm going to quote 16 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| This is from the Living Bible version of the Bible, and it's close to me for several reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=553)|
| 0:09:26| And so I'll quote 16, and then I would like to pray and would appreciate you praying with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=566)|
| 0:09:34| Keep me safe, O God, for I have come to you for refuge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=574)|
| 0:09:37| I said to the Lord, You are my master.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| All the good things I have are from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| The godly people in the land are my true heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| I take pleasure in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| Those who chase after other gods will be filled with sorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| I will not take part in their sacrifices or even speak the names of their gods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| Lord, you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| You guard all that is mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| The land you have given me is a pleasant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| What a wonderful inheritance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| I will bless the Lord who guides me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Even at night, my heart instructs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| I know the Lord is always with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| I will not be shaken, for he's right beside me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| No wonder my heart is filled with joy and my mouth shouts his praises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| My body rests in safety, for you will not leave my soul among the dead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| and you did not leave your godly one to rot in the grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy of your presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| and the pleasures of living with you forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=638)|
| 0:10:47| Lord, we praise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| We thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| We praise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| I thank you for your word, your person, your active word in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=653)|
| 0:10:59| I am confident that I will see good in the land of the living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| It is in you and through you and by you that I pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| In your name, Jesus, amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=672)|

| 0:11:15| Commissioner Craig Leuthold will lead us to the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| Everybody will salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=690)|
| 0:11:43| Thank you, Commissioner Leuthold and Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=703)|

| 0:12:58| we do have some of those students and faculty here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=778)|

| 0:16:29| Does anyone object to adding a discussion item for the appointment process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| Seeing no objections, it will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Yes, I'd like to add reconsideration of the stormwater ordinance to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| As we know, at our joint committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| the law director spoke about several items related to that that should cause us to reconsider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| Mr. Law Director, do you want to speak to that stormwater?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| We can certainly put it back on the agenda for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| I talked with Bruce a little bit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Bruce has been working with the city to diligently come together on most of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1028)|
| 0:17:17| and I think a lot of progress has been made there, so we may want to have Bruce speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1037)|
| 0:17:23| And in light of that, what I would like to see happen is that item to be brought back in November for the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1043)|
| 0:17:35| and December for the second reading and basically to repeal the ordinance as we know it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| and to pass a new stormwater ordinance to include those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1062)|
| 0:17:49| And maybe this month is a good time to address it, but I think that will solve a number of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| What you are recommending is something of a substitute ordinance to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| and voted on in the next two meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Yeah, I wouldn't necessarily call it a substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| I would call it a new ordinance repealing what we have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Repeal and new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| That would satisfy me, and if we can add it as a discussion item, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| We'll add the stormwater as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Does anyone object?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| I see no one objecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| It will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1108)|

| 0:18:36| I'd like to ask that number 911 be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| It's already been pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| It has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| Is there any other amendments or anything to be added or withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1130)|

| 0:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1152)|

| 0:19:47| That's what I'm being told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Resolution 101 and 102 on page 3 need to be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1189)|
| 0:19:53| We'll do that unless we have a commissioner opposed to doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| Seeing none, 101 and 102's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1199)|

| 0:22:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Commissioner Luthold and I are extremely proud now to present to you the state champions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| of boys soccer in Class A AA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| When you win one championship, it's quite an accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| When you win two and you win three, it's quite an accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1357)|
| 0:22:41| When you win four, it's extraordinary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| This team, this school, has won five straight state championships in boys soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| So I don't need to say any more than that because any time you can celebrate five championships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| that's obviously a cause for celebration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| They've had celebration, but we wanted to honor them here today, Commissioner Luthold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| and I, along with Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| I want to introduce to you now the coach, Tom Gerlach, and I would ask that you say a few words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| and introduce any of the young men that you have here with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| We'd just like to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| We're very humbled and honored to be here today to receive this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| I had one of my players come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| He wanted to get out of English, so he was able to get down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| This is Zach Probst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| He's my future All-State Forward this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Our theme verse this year is Matthew 516, which says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Let your light shine before men so they may see your good works and glorify your Father in Heaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| The proudest moment about this team isn't the fact that we've won five state championships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| It's the fact that these boys remember that it's not about the name on the back, but what they represent on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| And we'd like to give all the honor and praise and glory to our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| because when boys are united towards a certain goal and when they pray for each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1432)|
| 0:24:00| and play for an audience of one, things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| And it's really neat to see these young boys turn into men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| and God has honored us in that with five state championships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| So on behalf of CAK and the board and the whole school, we thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1455)|
| 0:24:25| I just want to say what an honor it is to represent CAK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| They do happen to be in the fifth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| although I'm sure they have students from all across the county and I'm sure from outside the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| They do an outstanding job with all of their students, not just their soccer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| Coach, you put it best when you play for the audience of one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| and I just want to congratulate them and wish them well in the season coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| and appreciate all that you do, Coach, informing all these young men to be great young citizens of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1498)|
| 0:25:07| Appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1507)|

| 0:29:58| But like the coach at CAK, I think when you talk to the people who have had him in class or who he coached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| they'll tell you, first of all, he was a great coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=1803)|

| 0:47:20| And what we've done, what Trane has done, is looked at 10 campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| I think there's actually 12, 13 schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| but 10 campuses where we can make some improvements and save, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| approximately $842,000 a year on energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| The savings would be plowed back into equipment, replacement of lighting and HVAC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2856)|
| 0:47:43| and some equipments such as that to save energy costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| So I think the total cost is a little over $10.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| I think with the financing, maybe it's right around $16 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| I mean, savings is right around $16 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| with the cost being about $15.7 million or $15.8 million, somewhere in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| So there is net cash flow with this project all throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| But I know you were interested in some of the specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| but just kind of a general overview from the school's part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| So, again, I appreciate Mayor Ragsdale and the finance department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| and also the school board working with us on getting this arrangement set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| And let me also say thank you for the monies that you provided for us to do roofing and HVACs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| I think there's been $5 million a year over a period of the last three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| and certainly that has helped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| It just seems like it's never enough with all the facilities and so forth that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| So at this point, I'll turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| Thank you, Mr. Thomas, Commissioner Hammond, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Good afternoon, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| My name is Owen Novotter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| I'm the solutions leader with Trane here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| Commissioner Hammond, just to kind of give you a quick thumbnail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| the project is what's called a guaranteed savings project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| So, essentially, we've gone through the ten schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| We've identified about $17.6 million in energy savings by implementing a $10.25 million scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2942)|
| 0:49:12| The Trane Company is guaranteeing $16 million of those savings over the 15-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2952)|
| 0:49:20| So, essentially, what takes place, we have identified a scope of services to be implemented in the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| to improve the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| The school system, with the help of John Troyer, has gone out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| and solicited by way of an RFP for a municipal lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| The lease payments are underwritten by Trane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| We're executing the work for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| It's a defined scope with a defined price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| It has a defined return, which we are guaranteeing the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Knox County Purchasing, when they put the RFQ together, I would say as a taxpayer, it made me happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| As the winning ESCO, it was a tough one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| Each and every year of the agreement has to stand on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| Each and every year of the agreement has to be neutral or positive cash flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| and we cannot take any excess cash flow from a particular year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| and apply it to a deficit year, either forward or reverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| So each and every year has to stand on its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| The savings have to be basically accrued in the school's energy budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| It's a line item transfer within the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| And if at the end of the year there's a reconciliation process annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3027)|
| 0:50:32| if at the end of the year the funds are not there, Trane has to write the school system a check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3032)|
| 0:50:38| And, Bob, can you let us know each year, since each year does stand on its own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| can you let us know each year just kind of how it's going through a little memo or something just so we can have updates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3047)|
| 0:50:48| We'll be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| It sounds like a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Can you tell us the schools that have been identified to have these energy savings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3050)|
| 0:51:03| The schools in the ten-school pilot are Gibbs High, Farragut High, Bearden Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| Vine Middle Magnet, Farragut Middle and Intermediate, Carnes Elementary, Ball Camp Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| Olive Elementary, Spring Hill Elementary and Sequoia Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| Okay, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| Mr. Thomas, is this obligation coming from capital funds or is this from new appropriation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3085)|
| 0:51:35| It will be through the estimated savings that are in our general purpose budget that would actually take care of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3095)|
| 0:51:43| So the savings from the utility estimates there would pay those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| So you're not going to be coming to us asking for more money, more than likely, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| No, sir, we will not be coming in and asking for more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| You are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| And I guess some of these other questions are primarily to Mr. Nevada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| Mr. Nevada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| And, Mr. Nevada, I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| You called me and I appreciate your call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| I just didn't get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| The contract, and I scanned the contract, and it references Appendix A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| And Appendix A was supposed to supply a price list, and I don't think it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3143)|
| 0:52:30| Am I wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Appendix A would have been the draw schedule for the 12-month construction period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| Okay, so from the stuff that, from that document that you provided for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3157)|
| 0:52:41| we didn't really get a price list on individual items that you all are contracted to replace or whatever, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| And I guess this is probably to you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| Isn't it true that the state agencies and KUB will do an energy audit for free, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3175)|
| 0:53:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| We have worked some with TVA and KUB, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| And then my only other question, this is back to you, Mr. Nevada.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| Did not some of the document require the replacement of, like, in some schools, all urinals and all toilets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3194)|
| 0:53:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| The way the process works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| the train went in up front and did a preliminary audit of the schools that were identified to basically do a feasibility study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| to find out if, in fact, improvements could be made that would be self-funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3217)|
| 0:53:44| We brought that information back to the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| We confirmed that there is a project that could be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| but that final scope would be pending at what's called an investment-grade audit or a very detailed engineering survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3230)|
| 0:53:58| The school system elected to have train proceed with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| We went through all of the campuses very painstakingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3243)|
| 0:54:06| and came back with a recommended scope that gave the school system the best bang for the buck, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3246)|
| 0:54:13| And that scope varies school by school by school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| There are some standardized items, such as lighting retrofits, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| Each and every school has a very unique scope or a scope very unique to that campus itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3263)|
| 0:54:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| So some of the schools that were in that document, there wasn't a replacement of all the toilet stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| No, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| We've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3286)|

| 0:57:11| With the 14 people scoring the bids, their total score was 1,178.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| Blue Cross was second with 1,004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| And Carrington Healthcare was third at 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| And we would just move for you all to approve, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3446)|
| 0:57:32| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| I've got a motion by Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Second by Commissioner Tony Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3460)|
| 0:57:41| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Mr. Chairman, I want to bring something to the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| We talked about this earlier, but I am licensed through every one of those companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| and make sure it is permissible for me to vote on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3467)|
| 0:57:54| I mean, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3474)|
| 0:57:55| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| You're not gaining anything from this contract, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| No, that's for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3479)|
| 0:58:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| I didn't want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| I didn't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| Matt, you did an excellent, excellent job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3486)|
| 0:58:09| You've been working on this for probably nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| I know John Troyer has come in with it there, and Doug Holtz come in, and Francis with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| But the new committee that was formed, I really enjoyed the enthusiasm of all the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| office holders that brought people to the table this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| and they stayed at the table this time and walked through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| And, you know, we came up with the same decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3509)|
| 0:58:31| You know, same company, evidently, wanted it for the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| But I was thoroughly, thoroughly impressed with the way that you handled it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| and I appreciate all the employees for their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3518)|
| 0:58:42| You all did a first-class job on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3525)|
| 0:58:46| Matt, have you got anything to us like in numbers of the men?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Do we have anything up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| Numbers as you want scoring or cost or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| I think when we asked for it to be re-looked at that we did, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| ever how you all figured it out, did it come out to be with price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Because I think that's what we asked for, to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3549)|
| 0:59:13| Price was 60 points in the evaluation where network was 40 points of the evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| When we do an invitation for bid, price is always the dominant factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3560)|
| 0:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3567)|
| 0:59:28| Was the one who you're asking to be awarded, did they come in with the lowest price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| or did the 40% make up a difference somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| Their ASO fee was the lowest price over the course of the three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| Their stop loss was a little high, but based on the points that was established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| they did win the points category, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| So with the amount of money and the stop loss, if you added that together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| they would still win on dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| And we've got, I think we had Tim Wheeler, Nick McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| Do you all want to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3604)|
| 1:00:14| The only thing I would like to say is the new committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| we were only responsible for the 40 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3618)|
| 1:00:21| On Friday, when we picked up the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| we were instructed that John Troyer and Matt and them had come up with a formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| that they would do the 60 points and all we were responsible for the 40 points on network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3630)|
| 1:00:36| Whatever is handed out on the 60 points, mine are zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| There's going to be numbers in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| We did not vote as a committee on whatever formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| I have asked, trying to find out what the formula was on how they came up with 60 points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| but I did not judge on 60 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I only judged on 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| And you're welcome to ask Nick, Joy, the other committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3655)|
| 1:01:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Matt, I guess, do you have something to hand out to us that we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| this is probably a $20 million plus deal and we don't have anything to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3669)|
| 1:01:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3678)|
| 1:01:36| Ann, could you explain this to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3696)|
| 1:01:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| What you have in front of you, the first page is the cost analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| You can see that the ASO fee is a three-year fixed fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3712)|
| 1:01:57| and you can see the ASO fees across the board there and you can see how the points were distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3717)|
| 1:02:03| The next line item is the stop loss for year one, and it goes on down year two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3723)|
| 1:02:11| The formula is the standard formula that we use in purchasing that we use to figure price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3731)|
| 1:02:20| It's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| You take the low bid, divide it by the next low bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| and you get a percentage and you multiply that times the number of points in those categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| and that's what the second low bidder gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| That's how the points were distributed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| The second page is just maybe a little bit more breakdown for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| You can see the ASO fees, the number of employees, the monthly amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3761)|
| 1:02:46| as well as the annual amount based on the ASO fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| And then there's a three-year total, which is what we asked for in the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| We wanted a three-year fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| Stop loss for the first year, and then the last total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3778)|
| 1:03:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| I'm still a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Do you have something that has the total price of what these insurance companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| I mean, is it on the back page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3807)|
| 1:03:39| I thought it was like $19 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| And you're talking about it's only $3 million a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Yeah, $3 million is the administrative part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| and the $19 million includes all the claims to the providers and the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3829)|
| 1:04:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| Did your committee, did the committee see this number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| And why were they not, I guess, involved in the 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| and they were only asked to evaluate the 40%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| Well, as I said, the 60 points that were given for price, and they were told this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| there's a mathematical formula that we figured for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| It's very objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| It's not subjective whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| They were instructed that they would be evaluating on the network portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3878)|
| 1:04:52| Mr. Chairman, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| Could you explain to me when on this first page you got the stop loss for years two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| and three Blue Cross and Cary have zero dollar amounts and, therefore, they got zero points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| And just explain to me why did they have evidently no bid or what's that supposed to mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3909)|
| 1:05:18| They chose not to put a price in those two years, two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| And that's why we weighted it less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| We weighted it less important than the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| But they chose not to put a price in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| And Knott's County reserves the right to, and it's plainly stated in the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| we reserve the right to re-bid stop loss separately after the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| We can re-bid the whole contract in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| I mean, if you're recommending Cigna today, is that contract a one-year contract, period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3949)|
| 1:05:59| It's a three-year contract with a two-year extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| So we're bidding today for a three-year contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Correct, on the ASO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| So Cigna would be the provider for three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| And if we're not happy after the first year, is it an automatic extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| I'll refer to Mr. Owens, but I believe just about all of our contracts have some sort of out clause associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3981)|
| 1:06:28| I just want to make sure that if we're unhappy with their service, we have the ability to get out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3988)|
| 1:06:36| I mean, we can certainly make sure that's incorporated within the contract, and we almost always do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| I haven't seen this one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| I mean, they just now finished their evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4004)|
| 1:06:51| Would the commissioner who made the motion make sure that that is part of their motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4011)|
| 1:07:00| that we have some type of clause that the county has the right to cancel this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4020)|
| 1:07:10| Commissioner, maybe what we need is it automatically comes back to us in one year for approval for the second year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| That would be fine with me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| Either way, I mean, we need to, if things aren't going well, we need to have the ability to re-bid it or to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4038)|
| 1:07:26| I don't want to be stuck, and it doesn't matter who this contract's with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4046)|
| 1:07:32| It's any contract Knox County has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| I think we should have the ability to, if we're not satisfied, to cancel it and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4054)|
| 1:07:43| With your bid, Matt, did it contain the usual clause that it may be terminated for any or no reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4063)|
| 1:07:51| I believe it did, sir, with appropriate notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| You believe it did or we know it did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Because if we approve of something and we come back and say, well, we thought it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| And we've got some office holders here or the people that served on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| Have you seen these numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4088)|
| 1:08:22| Anybody from the committee, from office holders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| Or Matt, if you want to go on and tell us if that was part of the contract and they can come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| It is part of the contract about us having the right to terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| What is it in the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| Can we come back next year and have to approve a carrier next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| We wouldn't be able to approve a carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| We'd have to go out for re-bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| We wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| If it was not renewed, I would be re-bidding this service again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4134)|
| 1:09:01| So at the end of the year, we don't have to have a cause to get rid of this company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| Is that on 30 days notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| I believe it's a 90-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| Typically, not something like this would be a 90-day notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| I would write that in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4153)|
| 1:09:14| So with 90 days notice, for any or no reason, the contract may be terminated by either party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| Or is it just by us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| By us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Any employees that were served on the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| I just want to make sure everybody is okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| I'm not sure we understand the question because we know the stop loss was for one year only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| and that the second and third year could go out for bid again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| But I've got it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| I'm trying to find if there's a clause in there about termination because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| You look at the bidding document, Tim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| Yes, I've got it right here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| And that's what I'm trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| It's several pages, about 16 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Matt may have found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| If he can show you where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| 3.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Yeah, I've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4217)|
| 1:10:21| It's an initial three-year award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| And it does state that in mutual agreement of the vendors in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4226)|
| 1:10:30| the award may be extended for one or two additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| But is that not, Matt, the stop loss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| That is the ASO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| It's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| The only other thing that I did look at was the stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| And, of course, it was only given so many points with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| And it was ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| And I emailed Matt, and he was probably at lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| And then I went to lunch, and then we were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| But I do find, you know, almost a $600,000 difference in a stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| And so there's where I had my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| But, you know, we did the 40 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| That's all I can tell you we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| If Knox County has their own formula how they did the 60 points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| they did the 60 points plus the 40 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| But the other committee members, we just did the 40 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Nick was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| The 40 points that Tim is talking about, it's not on here, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| I don't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| The 40 points was network coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| And how did that turn out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4303)|
| 1:11:53| I broke out the price component as well as the network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| Network scores, Blue Cross had 529 points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| Carrington had 308.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| And Cigna had 429.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| So on that, Cigna came in second, but they were number one on price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| So if you average all that together, what do you get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| Average, you're talking about the scores?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| You take the 60 and the 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| Because did you say Blue Cross Blue Shield had 592?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| Their network score was 529.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4351)|
| 1:12:35| Their price score was 475.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4355)|
| 1:12:44| I'm sorry, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Can you give me those again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| 529 for Blue Cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| How much for Carrington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| Carrington received 308 in network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| And Cigna?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| Cigna received 429.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| 429, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Do you want the price breakout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| Could you explain the first line on the first page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| It talks about you got 37.52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| Then you got 33.80 and then $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4396)|
| 1:13:24| Explain to me what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| That right there is the administrative services only fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| that the company will charge Knox County per employee per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| That's a per employee per month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Per employee per month for 36 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| That's their set fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| I was just curious what that meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| And did everybody bid on the exact same things that will be done, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| administrative costs and paying the bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Is this what we're?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| So everybody bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| They had our plan in the document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| These are the plans that the committee came up with for the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| and they all understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| And how did we come up with the 60% going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| The committee developed the evaluation criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| What committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Insurance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Committee of the expanded committee or the inside committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| No, the expanded committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| So you're telling us that Cigna is 2.592056.64 a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4471)|
| 1:14:41| Not a year, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| That is a total three-year fixed ASO fee, which was what we asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| and the first year stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| So the second year or the third year with the stop loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4494)|
| 1:15:02| it could go up if the stop loss increases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4502)|
| 1:15:09| Possible, if the stop loss increases, which I don't believe it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| Cigna proposed a maximum for year two and year three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| The other two carriers did not bid on year two and year three for stop loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| and that would be a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| It was our expectation as a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| and the vendor's expectation too that we would go out for bid after year one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| for stop loss coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| So stop loss coverage is through somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| It's not through Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| It is through Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| First year, and they gave us maximum prices for year two and year three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| but they and we both have the same expectation in year two and year three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| we would put this out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| So what we have is we have a guaranteed maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| but we think we can do better going out to the open market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| Well, the stop loss is like almost a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| and in Keratin it's $400,000 and Blue Cross Blue Shield it's $346,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4561)|
| 1:16:07| So how could they, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| what's the reason being $600,000 difference in the stop loss coverage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4569)|
| 1:16:17| I would have to defer to Cigna on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| I mean, does this, because I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| Maybe, Larry, you can help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| Does the stop loss coverage have to be with the company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Initially we proposed at the original proposal that the stop loss is independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| but at Commissioner Tindall's suggestion we bid this out as a package deal this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4594)|
| 1:16:52| Has anybody got any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Matt, or maybe even John,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| when you're trying to figure out the total cost of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| let's just keep it to one year since we don't have stop losses for the, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4622)|
| 1:17:09| I guess you take the cost of the administration cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| For instance, Cigna is $20 a month per employee, and you multiply that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| I guess you got the 2237, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| And that comes up to, I'm going to trust your figure, $44,740, and that's a monthly cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4642)|
| 1:17:30| I guess annually it would end up being $536,880.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| Am I reading this correct so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| Now, not being in the insurance business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| stop loss means that's the max that Knox County would have to pay out on, what, claims?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4663)|
| 1:17:52| Or explain to me what stop loss is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| We would have a limit of $250,000 that Knox County would be responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| These are catastrophic illnesses, diseases, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| That is 250,000 is the limit we set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| That is the most Knox County would have to pay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| This insurance company picks up everything over and above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| So what's the 981 stop loss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| 981,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| That is the cost of that insurance for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| That's the cost for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| So you take the 536,880 plus the 981, that's the cost of that bid for the first year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4708)|
| 1:18:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| But, Commissioner, keep in mind we're looking for a three-year fixed rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| That's why we did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4735)|
| 1:18:56| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| I'm just trying to get to a bottom dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| That's all I'm trying to get to, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4741)|
| 1:19:09| If you look, Matt, at the first column on the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| it says annual amount $1,007,186.88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4754)|
| 1:19:24| And then if you look at the first year stop loss at 345,254.84,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4764)|
| 1:19:34| that would be somewhere about 1.4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4774)|
| 1:19:39| Roughly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| And if you go to the second one and you did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4782)|
| 1:19:51| you're somewhere about 1.2 or 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| And you go to Cigna and you're probably 1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4796)|
| 1:20:07| Am I reading that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| If it figures that way, that would be correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4810)|
| 1:20:20| So if we did it, if we show those numbers like that, who comes in first, second, third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4820)|
| 1:20:26| Keratin would have a lower number initially, price-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| I have not figured points that way, so I would not, I don't have an answer to give you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4830)|
| 1:20:38| I know, but who comes up with the points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| The insurance committee came up with the 60-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4840)|
| 1:20:49| So maybe if we just went on price by itself, Cigna would probably be the highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| Is that right or wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| I mean, if you look at it for a three-year, because that's what we're asking for is a three-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| Yeah, but right now we've got to get through the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Yeah, a three-year contract, and that was how the points were allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| But if the other companies didn't provide a two- and three-year cost, then how do we figure what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4872)|
| 1:21:23| I mean, why wouldn't we just look at one year and try to get through that one year instead of having a three-year contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4883)|
| 1:21:32| We wanted a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| One, we wanted to keep the cost as low as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| but then, two, we didn't want to put the employees in a position where they have to re-enroll in a new insurance program every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| We wanted to have stability of benefits and stability of provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| We felt there was a real value to that, and so that's why we wanted to take a longer-term look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| I know Matt's there, but if there's any employees back there, I mean, as far as my vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4915)|
| 1:22:02| I just want to make sure everybody's on the same page and the employees are happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| Now, if they're not happy, they need to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| Well, Commissioner, I think it was a fair bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| The committee asked for a three-year contract, just as Mr. Toyer and Matt have alluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| And if you look at the numbers the way that you're looking at them, if you look at year one, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4941)|
| 1:22:26| your costs are different per carrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| In some cases they'll be less because your stop loss is so high on that one, but your other coverage is only $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| So it is, the numbers are a little bit off when you look at year one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| But when you look at the three-year contract, which is what was asked for, that's how your price comes in accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| It's kind of confusing the way that it came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| And I think that Mr. Toyer will agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| I mean, I know what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| You got the $20 and then you got $36, $37, and then you got $39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| And Blue Cross and Carrington are at $300 in stop loss, but Cigna is at $900,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| So I don't know, I guess it's kind of a numbers game if you want to look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4987)|
| 1:23:11| I mean, if Blue Cross and Carrington come back in and did the same thing, kept the numbers the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| like Blue Cross and Blue Shield at $346, kept it for year two, and then went up $100,000 on year three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=4997)|
| 1:23:26| then where would they have been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5006)|
| 1:23:30| Probably for anyone to look at stop loss for three years is almost unheard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| That's why we only gave five points for year two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| Year two was three points and year three was two points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5018)|
| 1:23:44| So, actually, to take the $900,000 and run it over three years, with the number being that high, I would say that you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| But Blue Cross or Carrington couldn't guarantee their $300,000 figure for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5030)|
| 1:23:57| Cigna probably could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5038)|
| 1:23:59| They could probably guarantee their $900,000 for three years because it's so far up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5039)|
| 1:24:12| It's kind of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| So, are you all satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| The people who serve from the other offices, are you satisfied with the recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5058)|
| 1:24:26| I can't speak for the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5066)|
| 1:24:29| Can you speak for yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| I would have liked to look at the one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| It's a new company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| It's a company we haven't dealt with, but I guess it wasn't drawn up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| If you look at your cost over the first year, it's less with others, but we're talking about $100,000, $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5085)|
| 1:24:53| In the point structure, I'll reiterate what Matt said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| We had to give more points to the cost than we could to the provider network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| I would say the majority of the committee would have put more points on the provider network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| than they would have cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| But due to the fact this was a bid and not an RFP, we had no choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| I would say if the committee could have, we would have put 75% on the network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| and 25% on cost because that's what the employees want is a big open network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| And there are some pretty big differences when you look at the networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| But we had to deal with what we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5130)|
| 1:25:35| So is the network, and anybody can answer this, the same between Cigna, Carrington, and Blue Cross?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5135)|
| 1:25:43| I mean, for the employees, the network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| There's differences in networks all across the county, all across the state, and all across the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5151)|
| 1:25:58| depending on which carrier is chosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| Minor differences or something that could?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5160)|
| 1:26:04| Well, we asked the question, do you have a national network?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| All three answered yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Part of the network questions dealt with discounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| Some people have a better discount in particular areas than others just because they're more prominent there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5176)|
| 1:26:25| There's just subtle differences, you know, with all of them, depending on where you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5185)|
| 1:26:35| This is Mr. Jerry Burgess with HC21 who can also talk about the networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5195)|
| 1:26:45| Hi. I've been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| I'm Jerry Burgess, president of Healthcare 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| which is a nonprofit entity that works with its membership that are corporations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| including organizations like the county and the city, in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5213)|
| 1:26:58| I think I have two comments that might help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| And first is in terms of networks, there are differences, but they're pretty minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5223)|
| 1:27:09| I don't think your employees have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| The major difference is that in Carrington, there normally isn't a Baptist hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| But understand in this situation, they have included Baptist hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| So that makes the networks virtually, you know, the difference is insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| I'd like to help you on the understanding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| I didn't develop this, but I've been sitting here studying it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| I think for the county to have a good deal, that you need to lock in Cigna on its ASO fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5259)|
| 1:27:53| You understand that ASO fee is the administration fee, usually goes up with the CPI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| the normal inflation rate, where medical costs, the claims cost piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| is much higher than that and variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| So stop loss is not reliable after 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| That's why the committee put the points where they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| is that year one stop loss is really what's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| The ability for a carrier to guarantee ASO fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| because there's certainty in that cost goes up with CPI, is much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5301)|
| 1:28:29| So what you really have here is Cigna saying they're going to guarantee their ASO fee three years for a phenomenal price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5309)|
| 1:28:36| I'll tell you that's a phenomenal price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5316)|
| 1:28:39| What they have done, though, is made up the difference in their stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| So it's very important that the county bid out stop loss next year to keep it competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5323)|
| 1:28:52| And it's only reliable one year at a time anyway, so you need to do that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| And second, it's very important that you lock in Cigna in this contract in a very, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5337)|
| 1:29:05| without any loopholes so that Cigna will live up to that ASO fee in year two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5345)|
| 1:29:13| Because if you don't do that, then your chairman, Scott Moore, your analysis of year one then would be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5353)|
| 1:29:22| But if you can lock them into that three-year-old ASO fee in a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| and John makes a good point too, John Troyer, that you really don't want to change carriers every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| There's a lack of continuity, you know, and disruption to your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5374)|
| 1:29:39| So hopefully the best deal for the county would be to keep Cigna for three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| keep them at an ASO fee of $20 or very close, shop out next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| and get a different stop loss carrier if Cigna is still at this price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| And Cigna will use other stop loss carriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| It's not like they have to use their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5402)|
| 1:30:07| That's the way to get the best financial deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| And the networks I wouldn't worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| There's little significant difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| And this may be to Mr. Troyer or whoever wants to answer, maybe Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| With going self-insured with this plan, is there a board that makes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5420)|
| 1:30:27| in county government for a place for people to go if they get turned down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5427)|
| 1:30:34| And if so, how do we make that board up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| Our committee has talked about an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| We have not come with a formal recommendation, but that's expected future work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5442)|
| 1:30:54| So, I mean, when are we going to expect that to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| I mean, we're going to be going into this program January 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5459)|
| 1:31:06| And I think we need to let the employees know, too, that there's a place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| because we have had instances where people had to appeal something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5469)|
| 1:31:18| And, I mean, some of our employees just had some problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| and other ones have got through pretty easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| So, in your mind, how do you see the board made up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Is it going to be people appointed by health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| or is it going to be people appointed by the mayor or county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| And how many members will be on the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| As Mr. Troyer said, the insurance committee has already discussed this once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| We will be having more discussions in the very near future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5503)|
| 1:31:47| as long as trying to get bids out for EAP as well as COBRA administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5507)|
| 1:31:52| And it would be my hope as chairman that we come to you all in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| with a recommendation of, you know, number of people, types of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5516)|
| 1:32:02| that would need to be put on a board, whether they be just county employees, citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| medical professionals, we'll hopefully come with those recommendations to you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| I don't know that it's the insurance committee's place to name names to serve on this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5533)|
| 1:32:21| I think we would feel that you all would serve that better than we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| but we would come with numbers, types of people that you ought to consider to put on the appeals board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| The appeals process is the first and second level of appeals is to the carrier that we contract with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| The third level of appeal is to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| Commissioner Norman and then Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| John or the mayor, I take a look at the first year, and I know we're trying to, it would be best to hold it to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5569)|
| 1:33:00| What I'm looking at for Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, just in round numbers, is about $150,000 more for the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5580)|
| 1:33:10| And it's a little more than $200,000 more than Keratin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5590)|
| 1:33:17| Is it worth the extra cost for year one to try to tie this up for three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| Is that your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| It's just if you lay out the numbers over a three-year, to have three years of ASO and one year of stop loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5607)|
| 1:33:35| Cigna comes in at $2,592,000, Keratin at $3,122,000, and Blue Cross at $3,367,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5615)|
| 1:33:42| So it's significant savings to lock in for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5622)|
| 1:33:52| John, can I make one comment on that that might help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| That is that the ASO fee, you see, is fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| The stop loss is very variable, so they're placing their bet on the fixed piece, not the variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| You see, these stop loss numbers of Keratin and Blue Cross are not likely to be good numbers in year two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5644)|
| 1:34:14| But the ASO fee, you can lock in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5654)|
| 1:34:19| That's what makes Keratin a preferable choice here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5659)|
| 1:34:24| I mean Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5664)|
| 1:34:28| Well, and I'm taking a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| In the numbers you just told me, John, are not total costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| That's not total costs for stop loss for years two and three, and I understand that's a big variable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| But you're taking what they save in their ASO, multiply that times three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5683)|
| 1:34:52| and then not multiplying three years' worth of stop loss in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| You just got one year versus stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| So I'm not sure that we save as much money as we think if the stop loss is still going to be that much greater through this company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5700)|
| 1:35:12| It could be through anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| What we asked for in the bid process was we asked for a fixed three-year ASO fee, and that's how we scored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5714)|
| 1:35:24| It was our expectation that we would bid out the stop loss after one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| And what we tried to do, Blue Cross and Keratin, did not put a price for year two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5729)|
| 1:35:34| or year three on stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| But what we're trying to do is save on the fixed cost of the ASO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5736)|
| 1:35:42| and then hopefully we can come back in years two and three and save a lot more money on the stop loss by bidding it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| than what we're going to have to pay that first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Well, whatever year two and year three of stop loss turns out to be, because it could be with anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| that the proposed contract would be three years of ASO and one year of stop loss with Cigna would be $2.5 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5756)|
| 1:36:03| with Keratin it would be $3.1 million and Blue Cross $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| So the pieces that we're locking in today, that's the cheapest route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5767)|
| 1:36:12| Now, what you've locked in today is three years' worth of ASO and one year of stop loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| We don't know what the two and three are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| Right, and that's exactly what we're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| In essence, we really don't know what our three-year costs are going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| because we don't know what the stop loss is going to be in years two and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Right, and we're not trying to get the total stop loss cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| What we're trying to do is say that of what the contract has presented today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5795)|
| 1:36:39| those four pieces, three years of ASO and one year of stop loss, those four pieces together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| the cheapest selection is Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| Now, we know that we're going to have to bid out year two in stop loss and year three in stop loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| and whatever the market is is what the market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| And so in an apples-to-apples comparison, it came out the cheapest route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| What it is is that Cigna is willing to take the – they're willing to go with the smaller ASO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5821)|
| 1:37:10| but with the guaranteed extra money on the stop loss is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| For one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| For the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| Right, that's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| Because it starts out basically a couple hundred thousand more the first year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| we're hoping that over the three year is that's where we're going to get our savings, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5842)|
| 1:37:27| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5847)|
| 1:37:34| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Yeah, and I'm way out of my element with insurance, so I'm struggling a little bit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5855)|
| 1:37:41| so I hope you'll bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| If Cigna is willing to let us re-bid the stop loss coverage in year two and year three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5864)|
| 1:37:52| why wouldn't they be willing to let us bid the stop loss coverage with someone else right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| Because what I'd like to do is I'd like to go ahead and sign the three-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| I think the $20 per employee is a great deal for the three years of coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| But then if we're going to re-bid the stop loss next year, why not re-bid it this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| We're talking more than double the second highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5893)|
| 1:38:22| and nearly three times the low bidder on the stop loss coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| so why don't we just re-bid the stop loss coverage this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5906)|
| 1:38:33| Because for the first year the ASO and the stop loss coverage were bid together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| and we'd have to bid both pieces again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Is that the only way that it can, I mean, could we bid both pieces again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| and see if they'll stick with that $20 a person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5925)|
| 1:38:51| I mean, I just hate to spend an extra $600,000 if you look at one bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| an extra $500,000 if you look at another one if we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| I think we can find a lot of good things we could do with the money if we could save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| I appreciate your sentiments, but I think if you look at it from a three-year cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| the Cigna cost is $2.5 million, the Keratin cost $3.1 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| and Blue Cross the cost of $3.3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| And so we bid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| We asked for prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| The vendors had the choice of what they wanted to propose, and we chose the one with the least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5961)|
| 1:39:38| And I don't know anything about insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| All three plans, one of the things the employees wanted to talk about was they didn't want a gatekeeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| Now, does all three plans have plans where one of them doesn't have a gatekeeper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Because I thought last month we talked about the same amount of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=5996)|
| 1:40:02| It was going to cost the employees in the county the same amount of dollars as it was the month before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| But some of the deductibles went down $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| And we talked about that last month in one of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| In another plan, one of them went down a deductible of maybe $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| And the price was going to stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| All of the vendors had the same benefits proposal that the committee worked very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| very hard on to go over every single detail on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6028)|
| 1:40:32| And all of the vendors bid on the same set of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| And all three options, actually there's four options now, are all PPO or open access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6037)|
| 1:40:45| And there's no gatekeeper on any of the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6045)|
| 1:40:50| So are you telling us that for the first year all we're going to have to pay is the 981-416-64| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6050)|
| 1:41:10| and the $20 per employee per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6070)|
| 1:41:21| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| We don't have brokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| We don't have anybody else that we have to pay out of this insurance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| We pay that and we're done except for the claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| There's no extra money nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| We don't have to go into HR for doing anything or helping with the insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| It's that flat fee and nothing else except for the bills that come in we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6101)|
| 1:41:50| Cigna would pay out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| This is the contract before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| No, that's not what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| I'm asking about the insurance as a whole because I don't know anything about insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| So I'm trying to get the total package for our health insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| take out the cost of someone going to the doctor and getting the bill sent to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6129)|
| 1:42:16| If Cigna was to win it today and get approval, all we're going to pay is $20 per employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| and that's 2,237 employees at $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| And we're going to pay the 981-416-64 in the first year stop loss, and that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6150)|
| 1:42:44| There's a separate proposal today for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| It's a contract to offer the flexible benefits card, and that would be another cost, another contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6167)|
| 1:42:55| Coming up, there will be an employee assistance program proposed contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| and that's going out for a separate bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| Would the company like a Cigna or Blue Cross be the one bidding on these extra things coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6186)|
| 1:43:18| Or is it somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| I mean, is it a company that's not in the health care field?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Yeah, it could be anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| We try to have as wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| I mean, does Cigna do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| Which piece, the employee assistance program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| You know, I don't know if they do or don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| And what about the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| The flexible benefit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| That was a separate bid proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| I understand that they do do that, but they were not awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6225)|
| 1:43:52| They didn't win the bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| Would you not save money maybe by having somebody do it all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6236)|
| 1:44:09| We bid just separate pieces, and so we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| I know, but why did we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6252)|
| 1:44:14| Is there just other than we bid it, was there a reason that we bid it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6254)|
| 1:44:22| We tried to have as many options as we could, and we tried to get the best deal on every single piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| What we were concerned about is that, you know, you might get a great deal on part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| and a not so great deal on another part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| and we wanted to make sure we got the best deal on each piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Mr. Chairman, to help answer your question and clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| it actually usually works the opposite way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| That if you bundle things together, you don't get as good a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| Usually when you break them out and bid them separately, you get a better price in health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| Yeah, I mean, because I said I didn't know anything about health care, and I'm just trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| It's a good question, but it actually is wise for them to do it the way they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Matt, how does this price compare to the one we had previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6304)|
| 1:45:11| Previously we had locked in Cigna, the proposal that I brought to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6311)|
| 1:45:17| we locked them in at $31.45 for a three-year fixed fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| And the stop loss wasn't part of that, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| Stop loss was bid separately at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6327)|
| 1:45:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| And did we ever have a winner on that or how much that cost was going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| I think you all directed us to bundle these four services together and go back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6336)|
| 1:45:50| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Well, I do know a little about insurance being on the claim side 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| but by the ASO fee and up to whoever would win the bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6356)|
| 1:46:04| you're having approximately $400,000 in savings each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6364)|
| 1:46:08| So before you can break even again, you're going to have to save $1.2 million over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| And when they talk about stop loss, basically you're talking about reinsurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| and a certain risk of $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6377)|
| 1:46:21| And we're talking about bidding high, one bidding high, and the other one is a little bit lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6381)|
| 1:46:26| I would almost bet you today that the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| and third year you're going to see that line almost come together because it will be competitive bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6389)|
| 1:46:35| My guess is the $345,000 and $351,000 is a little bit lower because their bids are a little bit higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| So you're having it on both ends of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| But the second and third year, it wouldn't surprise me to see them in the $400,000, $500,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| $600,000 range for each of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| So when you bid that out, but we can't overlook the $1.2 million savings for the three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| Whatever we do today, we need to lock that in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| In my opinion, even if we have to suffer, if you want to look at it that way, the 981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6420)|
| 1:47:07| Because when he says Cigna can bid it out to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| there's companies out there that will assume the risk at a certain dollar price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6430)|
| 1:47:16| So Cigna chose it this year, but it could be any number of insurance companies the second or third year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6436)|
| 1:47:26| But the $250,000 is just our loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| That's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6450)|
| 1:47:31| We'll never have to pay any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| So the second and third year, I think when you re-bid the stop-loss or in my terms re-insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6453)|
| 1:47:41| then it's going to be more near to parity because you're bidding that item separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6461)|
| 1:47:48| But we are saving not quite $400,000 a year, $1.2 million over three years on the first bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6468)|
| 1:47:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6480)|
| 1:48:04| Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| This ASO now, that's locked in for three years, isn't it, that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| The $20 is a fixed three-year fee, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| So we've got a lot to gamble on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6496)|
| 1:48:18| You're saying that we can put this stop-loss out next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Can anybody bid on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6508)|
| 1:48:29| We've got a lot to gamble on, on the savings we're making this year with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| the Manhattan one, that it won't go up that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| In other words, what I'm saying is we're seeing the $351,795, say, on Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6517)|
| 1:48:45| That's roughly $600,000 cheaper than Cigna is on the stop-loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6525)|
| 1:48:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6534)|
| 1:48:55| We've got roughly $600,000 we could afford for Cigna or Blue Cross to go up next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6535)|
| 1:49:02| and we'd still be on the same price we are right now with Cigna.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| I didn't quite understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| If Carrington went up $600,000 roughly, that would put them $951,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6552)|
| 1:49:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| If they went up next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| We would still be sitting on the same figure here, the $2,559,000 total price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6563)|
| 1:49:30| with the 16 Cigna charges on the ASO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| That's locked in, you said, for three years, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| The $20, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| That is locked in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| If Carrington went up to $900,000, say, next year in bid, we'd still be sitting on what the county is paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6581)|
| 1:49:47| It's the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6587)|
| 1:49:48| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| So we've got roughly $600,000 to gamble that we may get this stop-loss next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6593)|
| 1:50:02| It may not go up $600,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| We could end up paying less next year or maybe just a very minimal more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6603)|
| 1:50:09| Is that not correct, Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| We've got quite a bit to gamble on there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| So if the people are satisfied with it, I think we need to go with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| because the way I'm looking at it, you know, $600,000 is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| You can almost double, I mean triple Carrington and Blue Crosses there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| and it would just be the $981,000 roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| You're talking about a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| So we're sitting basically on the same amount of money if they triple theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6631)|
| 1:50:44| In a perfect world, if things go like we think that they're going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| if you look at the $20 per employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6648)|
| 1:50:51| if Carrington gives the Knox County employees good service for three years, I mean Cigna, sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6651)|
| 1:50:57| Next year, we would hope that the stop-loss would come in at about $400,000 or $300,000 in that range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6657)|
| 1:51:04| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| And it may be Blue Cross Blue Shield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| It could be Carrington or it could be ABC on the street with our stop-loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| As long as we keep our contract for three years, we're going to save a lot of money, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| If after one year things don't work out and you all decide to re-bid this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| then we're not going to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| If we have good service, things go well, we should save a lot of money for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6684)|
| 1:51:34| Okay, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6694)|
| 1:51:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| I think I've seen the light and I have some numbers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| I think my high school math teacher would be proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| The difference when you calculate the savings, and I think we have, what, about around 2,400 employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6707)|
| 1:51:54| That's the numbers that I used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| When you calculate out the savings, it's really, and we're just looking at the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6717)|
| 1:52:07| With Carrington, we would save $183,000 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| With Blue Cross Blue Shield, because of the difference in the stop gap, we'd save about $130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6734)|
| 1:52:21| So basically what we're doing is we're paying $130,000 more in one instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6741)|
| 1:52:28| This is provided that my math is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| And a little under $200,000 in another instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| We're paying a little bit more the first year to lock in that $20 per employee per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6755)|
| 1:52:43| Now, under that mathematical equation, I think that's a very reasonable amount to pay to lock in the three-year contract on the $20 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6763)|
| 1:52:56| And then this frees us up to re-bid the stop gap next year with somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6776)|
| 1:53:01| So I intend to vote for this after doing a little math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| And I think that it is going to cost us a little more this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| But what it's going to do is it's going to lock us in a significant amount of savings over the next three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6790)|
| 1:53:16| And like I said, I had to do a little figure to get there, but that's where I'm at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6802)|
| 1:53:23| Thank you, Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6803)|

| 1:53:49| Was it pretty well decided that we have the, I don't know if it's in the form of an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6829)|
| 1:53:55| because Matt said it's there, the ability to re-bid one year with the carrier as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6835)|
| 1:54:00| I believe you said that's in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| That's in the contract, is it not, Matt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| Not to re-bid, just to, we can cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6844)|

| 1:54:37| 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6877)|

| 1:54:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6898)|

| 1:55:00| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6900)|
| 1:55:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| Matt, you just want to explain this to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Is this like the smoking of $220 or $120?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| This is the Flexible Benefit Administration, which the employees are using now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6915)|
| 1:55:20| It's a little debit card that money's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| They get to submit, they get to put in some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6924)|
| 1:55:28| The county has some contributions we make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| They use it to pay co-pays at the doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6930)|
| 1:55:32| They use it to buy eye solutions for, you know, those contact wearers, different things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6932)|
| 1:55:39| Old contract will expire December 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| We rebid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| And Fringe Benefits out of Tallahassee, Florida, is the awarded vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| And the non-smoker benefit goes on this card, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| Mr. Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| Matt, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| If you put $1,000 in it per year, you have to spend that year or you lose it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| Please forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| I'm directing those to John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6969)|
| 1:56:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| Yeah, for the flexible spending part, yes, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| The county has opted to give you a little bit of extra time to turn in your claims after the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| But, yeah, it's use it or lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| And do we have numbers on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| The price-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Price-wise, it's dependent on what you select.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| They're all the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| You can have a health reimbursement account or a flexible spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| And they're all $5.30 per employee per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| For every employee, even if we don't use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| For those employees who use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| Only those who use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| And there's something I thought I heard in the insurance that you're getting some money at the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7014)|
| 1:57:02| Instead of the smoker's discount, isn't the money, where does that fit into the insurance plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7022)|
| 1:57:12| I think I can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7032)|
| 1:57:13| For health risk or the health reimbursement arrangement accounts as well as the flexible spending accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7033)|
| 1:57:20| the money that is put in there for the year is put in at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| In other words, if you're on a medical flexible spending account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7043)|
| 1:57:27| and you elect to have $3,000 withheld from your check pre-tax over the course of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7047)|
| 1:57:34| divide that up over 24 pay periods or however you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| and you decide on January 3rd you want to spend that $3,000 to get LASIK vision correction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7058)|
| 1:57:46| it's there for you to use right then and there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| The money that goes into the health reimbursement arrangement, which would be the tobacco incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| as well as any income contribution, any reduced income contribution, would also be there the first of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7074)|
| 1:58:04| Anything that goes into the health savings account would accrue over time as it's taken out of your paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7084)|
| 1:58:12| So for health reimbursement arrangement and for flexible spending accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| medical flexible spending accounts, that money is there the first day of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| So which card is the money for the, I guess, is it $200 and something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7101)|
| 1:58:27| $240 per year incentive for non-tobacco use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7107)|
| 1:58:33| There are also incentives, and I don't have the documentation in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| for people who make less than $35,000 a year but greater than $25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7117)|
| 1:58:42| as well as for people who make less than $25,000 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| And it's on this card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| It would be on that card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7128)|
| 1:58:49| Basically the Visa or MasterCard, whatever vendor they use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7129)|
| 1:58:55| it would be on that card combined with the flexible spending money that you elect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| So every non-smoker that's in this plan will have a card January 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| With $240 on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| And they can use that for co-pays or whatever until that money is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Does that include your spouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| Do they have any credits in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7154)|
| 1:59:16| Right now it does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| For the first year it's strictly employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| We are looking in future years for possibly adding that provided we have the funds to afford it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| and make sure this goes smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| I know I have it with the city and it's a great plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| and they do give your spouse an opportunity to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| So I think it's a great plan for the county to start out with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| Our hope is to expand this so it does include spouses in future years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| because, yes, we have been following the city very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| and are very, very enthusiastic about what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7183)|
| 1:59:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7188)|
| 1:59:49| Commissioner Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Is this a different company than we had previously?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| We have had C&J Consulting out of Chattanooga up to now and through the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7195)|
| 2:00:01| This is a company called Fringe Benefit Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Is it a corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| It's a fringe benefit management company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| It is a new company for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7210)|
| 2:00:12| They have been around for a number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7212)|
| 2:00:14| and are very experienced and very big in this particular type of benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7214)|
| 2:00:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7229)|
| 2:00:36| Resolution 907 is requiring a public hearing time, place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7236)|
| 2:00:43| and format to be determined before any elected official vacancy can be filled by the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| Intergovernmental on a 6-0 vote, Senate, to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| Chairman of the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7257)|
| 2:01:02| I'll just take John to give us the update on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7262)|
| 2:01:05| John, you wrote all that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| I had it with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7267)|
| 2:01:12| Well, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| I believe you voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| Commissioner Hammond can help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| I believe you voted unanimously to send this to the Commission for recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7278)|
| 2:01:24| And that would be to place that within your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7284)|
| 2:01:30| And it is Rule 1, Section N,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7290)|
| 2:01:41| and it will be a new paragraph 3 that will incorporate that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| It's bound currently at about page 4 in your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7314)|
| 2:01:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| I'll make a motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7316)|
| 2:01:58| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7318)|
| 2:01:59| Mr. Chairman, without belaboring it, we all know that the jury, the judge, the public want public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| What this does is it goes on record as saying that this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| and future commissions will have a public hearing any time there is a vacancy of an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7330)|
| 2:02:16| And so we're just going on record as saying to the public, we've heard you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7336)|
| 2:02:20| and we want to do this and we want to make it part of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7340)|
| 2:02:26| Can we make it part of the rules that any elected official in Knox County or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7346)|
| 2:02:31| It says any elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7351)|
| 2:02:32| I mean, if we need to say Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| Well, some of the appointments we don't get to appoint, but there are appointed people like criminal court judges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Any that we would have any auspices over, any authority over would be the ones that we would have the public hearing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| There's nothing we can do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| I wouldn't think we could on a state vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7368)|
| 2:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7371)|
| 2:02:52| We've got a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7372)|
| 2:02:53| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7373)|
| 2:02:54| Mr. Chairman, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7375)|
| 2:02:56| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| Just throwing it out there is I think we probably need to put in there some kind of time frame about how soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7379)|
| 2:03:08| or how to give the public enough time to get information in before we have a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7388)|
| 2:03:18| and then enough time to consider all that prior to us doing the appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7398)|
| 2:03:23| I don't know if we want to put in there some kind of time frame or if we just want to stick with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7403)|
| 2:03:27| I'm fine with this right here, but I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| I just wanted to throw this out there and see what you all thought as far as maybe putting some time frames around that public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7409)|
| 2:03:36| and then along with the actual appointment date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| We can't do it by state law quicker than ten days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| but I didn't know if maybe we should put some time frame in there or just leave it open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| I just wanted to discuss that since we're finally in an open meeting and can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| I had thought about that, and that's why I put in there that the hearing time, the place, and the format would be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| It might be different if we were to replace a sheriff as opposed to, like, the juvenile court judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7443)|
| 2:04:08| which we did the appointment on, or if it's a fellow commissioner, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| So this would give us the flexibility in determining the date and the time and the format to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7451)|
| 2:04:16| Whatever commission body at that time would make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7456)|
| 2:04:19| But the important thing is that we've gone on record and said, yes, there will be a public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7459)|
| 2:04:23| but the commission would at that time determine how that would be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| I just wasn't sure if maybe we ought to put in there that we couldn't do a public hearing within a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| We had to wait at least so long, or like a week, or if we wanted to just allow that to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7473)|
| 2:04:42| Do you entertain any suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| Well, I'll recognize if you want to give your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| and then I think everybody here has a chance to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7489)|
| 2:04:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| Jim McEvers, 12630 Early Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| I think awareness has been heightened due to the recent ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7500)|
| 2:05:08| I think future commissions hopefully won't ever need reminding of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7508)|
| 2:05:12| but you might want to put something in there so that if future commissions should stray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| and say the public hearing will be in ten days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| and there's not enough time for anybody to do anything about it, just as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| I trust you guys, but future commissions, if they stray, this can stay in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7526)|
| 2:05:35| but they can make it so short that people can't respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| Well, that was sort of what I was getting at is we could come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7538)|
| 2:05:44| or another commission could come in here and say we're going to have our public meeting in two days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7544)|
| 2:05:50| and then we're going to vote on it in ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| So that's why I was just seeing if we needed to put in there that a public hearing couldn't be held prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7553)|
| 2:06:02| so X number of days, you know, maybe one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7562)|
| 2:06:05| But I just wanted to see what you all thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7565)|
| 2:06:14| But I'm fine with what we're here, but I just want to throw it out there as a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7574)|
| 2:06:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7585)|
| 2:06:27| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7591)|
| 2:06:32| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Resolution 908 is requesting that information packets for county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| intergovernmental finance and regular monthly meetings be available by 9 a.m. on the Thursday before said meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7600)|
| 2:06:48| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| Set that on to the rules, 6-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7612)|
| 2:06:54| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| Rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7617)|
| 2:06:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7618)|
| 2:06:59| The rules committee decided that John would update on what the rules actually are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7619)|
| 2:07:03| John, if you'll go over that, I think we've got a statement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| We just need to update it and make sure it's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7627)|
| 2:07:09| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7629)|
| 2:07:10| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7630)|
| 2:07:11| What we have already in our rules at Rule 1, Section 0, and Paragraph Number 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7631)|
| 2:07:21| it provides that a copy of the agenda, including proposed resolutions, attachments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7641)|
| 2:07:26| and quarterly reports by county officers and department heads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7646)|
| 2:07:28| shall be available to each commissioner five days before each regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7648)|
| 2:07:36| And we had a pretty lengthy discussion about that this morning at the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7656)|
| 2:07:41| What it will require in order for us to accomplish this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| to have it available at 9 a.m. on Thursday before each meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| is for everyone to get their information in, to timely get their information in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7669)|
| 2:07:55| so that my department and myself, where we can complete the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7675)|
| 2:08:03| we need to get that then to the commission office for Jolie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| to make sure that it all gets copied and put in your packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7687)|
| 2:08:11| Another thing that was done, so we already have a rule in place that takes care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7691)|
| 2:08:16| but everyone has to be diligent in getting their information into our respective offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7696)|
| 2:08:23| Secondly, we talked about the computer software package that is going to be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7703)|
| 2:08:31| and will be coming online hopefully by January or February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| which will make the entire agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7716)|
| 2:08:40| including all of the information in support of each item, available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7720)|
| 2:08:49| And so I would think that you would have that information much, much earlier by going online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7729)|
| 2:08:56| It would be available to you as well as the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| And I think we're looking at January and February for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7740)|
| 2:09:04| So improvements are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7744)|
| 2:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7749)|
| 2:09:10| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| Yes, I have a quick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7751)|
| 2:09:12| The section you quoted, Law Director, refers to five days before each regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7758)|
| 2:09:19| So my thinking is we may still need this for the intergovernmental and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7759)|
| 2:09:25| I think pretty much the same rule applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| We need you all to strive to get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7768)|
| 2:09:31| First of all, we need to receive the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7771)|
| 2:09:33| Then we draft the resolutions and have it available to you by Thursday before each meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7773)|
| 2:09:40| It's kind of an in-house rule that we can try to make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| Well, perhaps then we simply need to amend this section to say five days before each intergovernmental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7786)|
| 2:09:53| finance or regular session to make sure it's absolutely clear that it applies to all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7793)|
| 2:09:58| I mean, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| I understand that the commission would like to have the information, if not ten days before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7799)|
| 2:10:05| And we're going to do our best to make sure that you get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| But a lot depends on the information that is submitted and when it's submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7808)|
| 2:10:13| You can add that if you wish to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| Commissioner Hammond, do you want to modify your motion to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| I'm not going to make a motion, but I will, to incorporate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| The good news is that improvements are coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7825)|
| 2:10:28| But, yes, I'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| And I will second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| Just to add something in the end of it, if our office gets it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7833)|
| 2:10:38| the sheriff's office for years, I guess, have been delivering these packages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7838)|
| 2:10:42| and I'm sure they do it when their officers are not busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7842)|
| 2:10:47| Probably when they've got some downtime, not on call for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| Would it be better if we just come to here and pick our own packets up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| and we don't have to try to get the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7857)|
| 2:11:01| because I'm sure at some point in time somebody's not going to get their packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7861)|
| 2:11:05| and it may be the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7865)|
| 2:11:06| Well, maybe it ought to be that if you don't pick it up by a certain time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7866)|
| 2:11:11| then it's going to be taken to the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| Well, what we discussed is they will be in the office ready for you if you want to pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7874)|
| 2:11:20| If not, the sheriff's department will bring them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7880)|
| 2:11:26| So they're made available and ready for anyone to pick up at 9 a.m. on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7886)|
| 2:11:33| before any committee or the regular session meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| Joey, can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| I don't think they start putting them together sometimes until Thursday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7903)|
| 2:11:47| That was Thursday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7907)|
| 2:11:48| I thought we said Thursday evening or first thing Friday morning in rules this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| Either way, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| Right now we're going to try to get everything to Joey by noon on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7914)|
| 2:12:00| and that doesn't give her a lot of time to copy them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| Well, if everyone is supposed to have their stuff to us by the first day of each month by noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7924)|
| 2:12:10| and we don't accept anything after that, they can get their work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7930)|
| 2:12:18| And then if someone needs to bring something, bring it the day of the commission or wait until next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| but don't go up to our office and try to add something after the first Monday at 12 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7942)|
| 2:12:29| And I think that way they can get their work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| So as long as we adhere by that strict standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7953)|
| 2:12:36| Well, I think we still need to have some flexibility that if we need to add something to the meeting, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7956)|
| 2:12:44| we need to have some flexibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| But I do agree we need to get our, when we know we're going to have it, we need to have it in on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7967)|
| 2:12:56| Otherwise it won't be included in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| But there are occasions where we do need to add things the day of the meeting or even at committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7978)|
| 2:13:04| Well, we can still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| We can still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| But it just will not be in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| That's fine as long as everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7990)|
| 2:13:14| If you're going to try to add something, it just may not be in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7994)|
| 2:13:16| So you either have to add it at intergovernmental or at the regular commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| and you don't have to bring it to county commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8000)|
| 2:13:23| One thing else I wanted to bring up was I would still like to see the zonings placed in a separate book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8003)|
| 2:13:30| so that we can hang on to those instead of having to return it with our book with everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8010)|
| 2:13:38| Well, I think we can talk about that at the next item because I'd like to see zonings myself on a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8018)|
| 2:13:47| Because, I mean, right now, you know, we're running, we are supposed to start zonings at 4 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8027)|
| 2:13:52| and we just don't, I don't think we give the public time or ourselves time enough to really look at the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8032)|
| 2:14:00| And that would give a time to have an extra meeting a month so we can discuss things at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8040)|
| 2:14:07| We could have a discussion between us as any items that we need to discuss for that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| But we can talk about that on the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| I just, as long as we get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8058)|
| 2:14:19| We ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| One thing we did talk about, and I think Commissioner Smith also agreed that, like, at the meeting time today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8060)|
| 2:14:25| sometimes they come around people wanting to add stuff on that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| you get a packet this thick and you just got it before the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| How do you have time to look at the information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| I think we need to warn those people that want to bring stuff and just throw it on your table here and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| okay, I want you to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| And a lot of times you don't have time to actually read the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8080)|
| 2:14:43| So we need to look at that real closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8083)|
| 2:14:47| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| You know, we get this and we don't even have enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| or have enough knowledge to even ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8091)|
| 2:14:54| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8094)|
| 2:14:56| So that item could be postponed to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| Well, that's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8099)|
| 2:15:00| If they don't have it in by the Monday at noon, they can come and add it at one of our committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8100)|
| 2:15:06| if they can get it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8106)|
| 2:15:08| Or add it on commission day if they get a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| Otherwise, they'd have to put it on next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8112)|
| 2:15:15| They could be prepared not to get it on to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| So they need to really be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| Well, a matter might be on the agenda, but you still are waiting on the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8118)|
| 2:15:23| I mean, there's a number of things that we don't get until the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8123)|
| 2:15:27| And it's not anybody's fault, but it's a matter of getting approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8127)|
| 2:15:32| Maybe it's a grant that we're awaiting approval on, still waiting on information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| Sometimes it's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| What you're suggesting changing is from the five days before each regular session in our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8140)|
| 2:15:45| to by 5 p.m. on the Thursday before each intergovernmental finance and each regular session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8145)|
| 2:15:53| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8158)|
| 2:16:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8162)|
| 2:16:03| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8163)|
| 2:16:04| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8164)|
| 2:16:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8165)|
| 2:16:06| Who made the motion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8166)|
| 2:16:08| And seconded by Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8168)|
| 2:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8171)|
| 2:16:14| 909, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8174)|
| 2:16:18| 909 is setting the regular monthly meeting of the intergovernmental committee at 8.30 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8178)|
| 2:16:24| on the third Monday of the month and the regular monthly meeting of the finance committee at 8.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8184)|
| 2:16:30| on the third Tuesday of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8195)|
| 2:16:36| I'll send it to the rules committee on a 6-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8196)|
| 2:16:38| Finance committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8201)|
| 2:16:42| Rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8202)|
| 2:16:43| Well, we decided since it's a short commission that we would wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| because last month or this month we had both committees together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8206)|
| 2:16:50| So we're going to wait until we decide on who's all going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8210)|
| 2:16:55| So no recommendation until we get the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| Is that right, Chairman Hammer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| If you recall, we decided at our last committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| that we would go ahead and combine the two committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| We're going to meet at the same time like we did this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| until we're back to a full 19-member commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| And then at that time I think it would be appropriate to decide on committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8237)|
| 2:17:24| and the times and everything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8244)|
| 2:17:27| So I think for right now we're just going to be meeting here at 830| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8247)|
| 2:17:30| with both committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8250)|
| 2:17:32| Is that right, Chairman Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8254)|
| 2:17:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8256)|
| 2:17:39| So we'll move that to withdraw this item for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| Seconded by Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8262)|
| 2:17:47| Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8271)|
| 2:17:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8272)|
| 2:17:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| Item 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8276)|
| 2:18:00| This is a concern setting the meeting schedule for the Knox County Commission meetings to be 3 o'clock p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| for the beer board, 4 o'clock p.m. for zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| and 5.30 p.m. for the regular monthly commission meeting or immediately following zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8291)|
| 2:18:17| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8299)|
| 2:18:20| Send it to the rules committee on a 6-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| Change committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8305)|
| 2:18:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8307)|
| 2:18:28| Rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8308)|
| 2:18:29| We recommend to try this November and December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8309)|
| 2:18:31| then revisit it in January to see how it's working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8311)|
| 2:18:35| But changing the date to time to 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8315)|
| 2:18:38| The time to 5 o'clock to 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8321)|
| 2:18:44| I had something I just wanted to throw out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8324)|
| 2:18:45| I didn't get a chance to come to the rules committee this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| If on the first Monday at noon people are supposed to have their agendas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8329)|
| 2:18:55| or their request into the commission office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| on the first Wednesday at 1.30 we have agenda committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| To hold the agenda committee in this main assembly room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| and because usually there's not many commissioners that show up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| but make that a meeting that we can discuss things on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| And then on the second Monday of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8357)|
| 2:19:31| have zonings at, say, like at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8371)|
| 2:19:39| to the public if they wanted to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8379)|
| 2:19:44| And then on the third Monday at 8.30 we would have our committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8384)|
| 2:19:55| And on the fourth Monday have county commission at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8395)|
| 2:20:01| That way you have downtown free parking for citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8401)|
| 2:20:03| who want to attend county commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8403)|
| 2:20:05| And, of course, if you have it at 5 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8405)|
| 2:20:09| a lot of people don't get off until 5 or 5.30 or 6 if they're not working for a government agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8409)|
| 2:20:21| Do beer board like at 6, 6.30 on the fourth Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8421)|
| 2:20:25| Yeah, you could do beer board at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8425)|
| 2:20:27| Can you all get through it in an hour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8427)|
| 2:20:29| Probably ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| It depends on how many we've got on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8431)|
| 2:20:32| It doesn't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8432)|
| 2:20:34| Mr. Smith would be better able to answer that than me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| But what that does to us is it gives us a meeting every week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8439)|
| 2:20:44| where we can have discussions between us since we can't discuss things outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8444)|
| 2:20:52| And that gives us time to talk about, you know, not having people here at zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| But I see that Buzz is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8456)|
| 2:20:59| Yeah, if Buzz Johnson were the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| the planning commission staff has no problem with whenever you want to schedule zoning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8463)|
| 2:21:09| We'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8469)|
| 2:21:11| Please keep in mind, though, whenever you decide to go to a different day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8471)|
| 2:21:17| the zoning ordinance requires a 30-day public notice time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8477)|
| 2:21:20| So if it's too early in the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| typically MPC reviews an item at one month and they hear it at the county commission the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8483)|
| 2:21:30| We need to have between the MPC meeting and the county commission meeting at least 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8490)|
| 2:21:35| If you have it too soon the next month, then unless you change the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8495)|
| 2:21:41| that would push it back another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8501)|
| 2:21:43| So just be aware that, you know, if we need to change the zoning ordinance, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| But just be aware that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| When do you all meet, Buzz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8510)|
| 2:21:51| We meet the second Thursday of every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| The second Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8514)|
| 2:21:55| So if we meet the second Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| That would be too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8521)|
| 2:22:02| The next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8522)|
| 2:22:03| They're a month behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8523)|
| 2:22:04| So it would be almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8524)|
| 2:22:05| I know, but it's within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| It all depends on how the months break up, too, as far as weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| You know, the first could be anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8530)|
| 2:22:15| You know, the first Monday could be the first through the seventh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| whereas the second could be anywhere from the eighth to the fifteenth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8540)|
| 2:22:25| And just depending on how the calendar falls, you could have where it would be too close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8545)|
| 2:22:34| If, say, the month started on a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8554)|
| 2:22:38| Well, it would just throw us off for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8558)|
| 2:22:41| It throws all those items off a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8561)|
| 2:22:44| And then there are three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| There's at least two and sometimes three months during the year we move everything up a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8569)|
| 2:22:53| Like November and December, we move everything up a week because of the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8573)|
| 2:22:58| And sometimes we do it in May because of Memorial Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| So that can throw everything off those months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8583)|
| 2:23:09| If we swap it around, is it possible to have a committee meeting the second Monday night instead of the third week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8589)|
| 2:23:25| Can the agenda be done that quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8605)|
| 2:23:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8610)|
| 2:23:31| And then we can move the zonings to the third Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8611)|
| 2:23:35| Well, I think you have some good ideas, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8615)|
| 2:23:39| I would like, personally, I would like more time to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8619)|
| 2:23:43| I'm prepared to go with what the original suggestion is and then try to work on maybe some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8623)|
| 2:23:51| Hopefully, you know, at some date and time we will have 19 commissioners again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8631)|
| 2:23:57| and I think we ought to afford those new commissioners a chance to vote on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8637)|
| 2:24:03| But I also have another question that has to do with the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8643)|
| 2:24:07| And as the law director, as far as procedures, does the commission set that time they meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8647)|
| 2:24:12| or does the beer board, being a separate entity, set their time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8652)|
| 2:24:17| The beer board can set its time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8657)|
| 2:24:20| And, of course, they follow the guidance of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| But the beer board is the one that sets its time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8663)|
| 2:24:25| So I don't think it's proper for us to set, as a commission, the beer board's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8665)|
| 2:24:33| I think they will probably respond to whatever we do with the other times that we decide to do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8673)|
| 2:24:40| but I don't think it's proper for us sitting here as a commission, not as beer board, to set the beer board's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8680)|
| 2:24:46| I think that's an independent board, and they need to set that on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| Yeah, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8691)|
| 2:24:53| They do it quite often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8693)|
| 2:24:55| And they do do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8695)|
| 2:24:56| I just don't think it is proper to be part of this motion since we're setting commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| We're sitting here as a commission, not as beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8700)|
| 2:25:04| As far as changing the committee meetings to the second Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8704)|
| 2:25:08| I looked over at my staff and yours and I got deer in the headlight looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8708)|
| 2:25:14| You know, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8714)|
| 2:25:16| You know, I was just suggesting that we ought to have some kind of meeting once a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| because since we can't even call each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| and discuss anything that possibly could be on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| if we just need to sit here and say, you know, Ivan, I've got my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| I need some help on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| Well, I think we could very easily just go ahead and schedule a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| and leave everything else alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8740)|
| 2:25:43| We can just have a workshop on one of these dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8743)|
| 2:25:49| so that we have a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8749)|
| 2:25:51| And then that way we can talk about any of the items that we wish to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8751)|
| 2:25:57| It might be easier than trying to move everything around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| and make sure that we have so many days between the NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8760)|
| 2:26:05| and us so that we can hear zoning issues in a timely manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8765)|
| 2:26:11| and making sure that we have enough days for people to get stuff in for resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8771)|
| 2:26:18| and getting our packets together because we just talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| I mean, I understand where you're coming from, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| and I think it's a good idea on the surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| I just think there's some other timing issues that might start coming into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8787)|
| 2:26:35| I'll say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| I mean, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8796)|
| 2:26:38| You know, way back when, whenever we started in 1990 with our new charter government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| we had two meetings a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8803)|
| 2:26:45| We had about half to deal with what we deal with now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8805)|
| 2:26:48| Our books were, oh, about a third of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8808)|
| 2:26:53| But, I mean, the workload really didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| Now we just have much more to do once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8817)|
| 2:27:00| But whenever we started, we had two meetings, two voting meetings a month, plus committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8820)|
| 2:27:11| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8831)|
| 2:27:12| Mr. Chairman, I think there's a lot of merit to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| splitting some things up and having, you know, focus on zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8834)|
| 2:27:17| and then focus on our regular business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| But another consideration that Mr. Eibenharman brought up this morning was the staff considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8839)|
| 2:27:23| because if we wait until seven, you know, the staff gets off at 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8843)|
| 2:27:28| And so, you know, they're either probably not going to go home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8848)|
| 2:27:31| or if they do, they're going to have to hurry back downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| So by doing a five o'clock, it's an easier transition for them rather than waiting until seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8853)|
| 2:27:40| And, you know, during that time, I'm sure that Mr. Vanderveet will be willing to take us all out to happy hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| you know, before seven o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8864)|
| 2:27:46| So there are some considerations there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8866)|
| 2:27:48| But I like the idea of meeting in the evening, make it more accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| and whatever the body chooses is fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8872)|
| 2:27:55| If you wanted to give this a try, I think the rules committee recommended just trying it for November, December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| see if it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8880)|
| 2:28:01| If it doesn't work, then we can always come back and revise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| Does anybody know what time the city council meeting is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8884)|
| 2:28:07| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| Do you think it would be simpler if we split these up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8890)|
| 2:28:14| if first we voted on a workshop, adding a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| and maybe pair that with the change in the time and place of the agenda meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8901)|
| 2:28:28| and then vote separately on the time of the regular commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8908)|
| 2:28:37| I mean, I just thought that might be a little easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8917)|
| 2:28:41| Is there any citizen out there that would like to address the commission about our time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8921)|
| 2:28:50| Does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8930)|
| 2:28:53| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8935)|
| 2:28:56| Commissioner Strickland, he's reminded me about three times I can't see his light for the monitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8940)|
| 2:29:01| I'm going to hit him the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8941)|
| 2:29:04| In the rules committee, we said that we were going to try this for a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8944)|
| 2:29:09| You sent this resolution on to the rules committee, and that's what we came back with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8949)|
| 2:29:14| and I'm totally in favor of trying it for a couple of months and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8954)|
| 2:29:19| Okay, we've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8959)|
| 2:29:23| Chairman, did you add the workshop meeting to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8963)|
| 2:29:27| Did you do that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8967)|
| 2:29:29| I'll second that if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8969)|
| 2:29:32| You want to do a workshop on this second Monday at 7 o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8972)|
| 2:29:39| I think it's important that we have more opportunities for public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| We have more opportunities to speak to each other in a public setting, and I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8984)|
| 2:29:53| When are we going to have a workshop on the first month, just come to talk to each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| Well, the first week of the month is the agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=8999)|
| 2:30:03| The second week of the month, we already know what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9003)|
| 2:30:08| We can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| Okay, we've got a gentleman at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| Jim McEvers, 12630 Early Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| You folks seem to be sitting up there really looking for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| and I guess I feel kind of guilty that none of the public has stepped up here to respond to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9021)|
| 2:30:25| So I appreciate the time adjustments you're trying to make and 530 and workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9025)|
| 2:30:34| I mean, I'll accommodate whatever you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| and I think it's great that you're trying to make this effort to make yourselves available in the evening for working folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9043)|
| 2:30:44| There's your public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9044)|
| 2:30:45| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9045)|
| 2:30:49| A couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9049)|
| 2:30:50| I'm just going to stick to what's in item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| Do we want to add the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9054)|
| 2:30:55| I still say that the ‑‑and I agree with everything, but I still think that the beer board being here is improper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9055)|
| 2:31:03| and I think the beer board needs to meet and set their own time because they are an independent board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9063)|
| 2:31:09| So before we vote on this, I'd like to withdraw the part about the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| and then when they meet, they can set their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9074)|
| 2:31:17| It might be exactly this, but I still think the beer board is not in session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9077)|
| 2:31:20| and they're the ones that need to set their own time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9080)|
| 2:31:22| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9082)|
| 2:31:24| Who made the motion to approve 910?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| I'll be happy to do that and take out the beer board and let the beer board decide what time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| The beer board will work with you, but if you need us to vote separate, we will vote separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9092)|
| 2:31:36| I think it could be proper because we're not in a beer board session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9096)|
| 2:31:40| I mean, the beer board is made up of county commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9100)|
| 2:31:43| I understand, but we're not sitting in a beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| and I think it needs to be set for the beer board to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9108)|
| 2:31:51| I'm just trying to look at it as whether it's proper or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9111)|
| 2:31:54| Well, the beer board chair may change the time of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9114)|
| 2:31:56| Why don't you leave it the way it is, and if the chair decides to have it at another time or date, he can set it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9116)|
| 2:32:04| So it would be 3 o'clock beer board, 4 o'clock for zonings, 5 o'clock or after the zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9124)|
| 2:32:09| and we'll do this only for two months and revisit it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| I think what he's saying is that he's leaving the chair still in charge of setting the time for beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9132)|
| 2:32:19| so we still need to withdraw, take out the part of the beer board setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9139)|
| 2:32:24| I mean, I just don't think it's proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9144)|
| 2:32:27| You can leave it in, and if the chair decides that he would rather hold the beer board meeting at a time other than 3 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9147)|
| 2:32:35| he can change the time of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| It will be 5 p.m. for the regular monthly commission meeting or after zonings, whichever is later, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9159)|
| 2:32:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9170)|
| 2:32:51| It's very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9171)|
| 2:32:52| Simply to change the word, recommend the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| You just put recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9178)|
| 2:32:59| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| That works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| Just change it to instead of 3 p.m. for the beer board, 3 p.m. recommended time for the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9181)|
| 2:33:08| and Commissioner Smith can change it at a beer board meeting or at his discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9188)|
| 2:33:14| Now, do we want to have, you know, on the first Wednesday at 1.30, we'll have an agenda meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9194)|
| 2:33:20| and we'll have it here, and it will be a commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9200)|
| 2:33:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9204)|
| 2:33:25| I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9205)|
| 2:33:27| Instead of just having it in the conference room, and then do we want to have a workshop on the second Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9207)|
| 2:33:33| I believe that would be a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9213)|
| 2:33:35| Well, that's fine, except for next month, the second Monday, we will be having committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9215)|
| 2:33:40| and then the month after, November or December, our committee meetings are going to be the second Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9220)|
| 2:33:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9225)|
| 2:33:46| The workshop will be kind of an informal discussion section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9226)|
| 2:33:50| so when we move everything back for holidays, we can just cancel the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9230)|
| 2:33:56| I'm just saying for the next two months we'd have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9236)|
| 2:33:58| I was reminding you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| I'd like to go ahead and second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| If somebody wants to make a substitute motion, you know, it's out on the floor for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9242)|
| 2:34:07| To do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9247)|
| 2:34:08| To second the motion of Mr. Hammond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9248)|
| 2:34:12| It's already been seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9252)|
| 2:34:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| Yeah, you can second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9255)|
| 2:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9256)|
| 2:34:17| And then if somebody wants to make a substitute motion, then let them go at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9262)|
| 2:34:23| I guess we're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9263)|
| 2:34:24| What are we voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9264)|
| 2:34:25| Yeah, I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9265)|
| 2:34:26| Just on 9-10, as it stands, with, I think, did we add it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9266)|
| 2:34:32| Recommend 3 o'clock for the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| And also, are we going to have the first Wednesday at 1-30 agenda meeting here for the full commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9274)|
| 2:34:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9281)|
| 2:34:43| First Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9283)|
| 2:34:44| First Wednesday at 1-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9284)|
| 2:34:45| Now, we've not added the workshop yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9285)|
| 2:34:47| I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9287)|
| 2:34:48| I think let's take a look at what we're doing, like we said, for a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9288)|
| 2:34:52| and then maybe come back first of the year and we might add in that workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| I think that workshop is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| I think so, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9297)|
| 2:34:58| I just think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9298)|
| 2:35:01| I just don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9301)|
| 2:35:02| We're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| We're saying we're going to revisit this in two months anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| And we won't be able to do the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| I mean, because we're already meeting that day anyway in committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9307)|
| 2:35:12| So I don't know that this workshop is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9312)|
| 2:35:15| I mean, we're going to meet in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9315)|
| 2:35:17| We're going to come back that night and talk about it all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9317)|
| 2:35:20| I can see where we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9320)|
| 2:35:22| Let's revisit it in two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9322)|
| 2:35:25| And with your idea about the agenda meeting, that's a good time to bring some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9325)|
| 2:35:31| And that could be in place of the workshop for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9331)|
| 2:35:35| Yeah, we can have on the agenda, can't we, Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9335)|
| 2:35:38| the agenda plus any discussion that we might want to have between us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9338)|
| 2:35:42| While we're in a meeting, we can discuss all the items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9345)|
| 2:35:46| And also have a place for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9346)|
| 2:35:49| If somebody wants to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9349)|
| 2:35:53| Yeah, I think it's important that we have different meetings at different times a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9353)|
| 2:35:58| so all the public will have one opportunity to come and speak to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9358)|
| 2:36:03| If they work nights, they can come to one of the day meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| If they work days, they can come to one of the night meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9366)|
| 2:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| We're ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9371)|
| 2:36:12| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9372)|

| 2:36:18| Resolution 9-11 is approving a contract with business information systems for county clerk software services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9378)|
| 2:36:27| Intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9387)|

| 2:36:31| Finance committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9391)|
| 2:36:32| Finance committee voted 5-0 for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9395)|
| 2:36:36| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9400)|
| 2:36:41| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9405)|
| 2:36:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9407)|
| 2:36:48| Seconded by Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| Mr. Chairman, I don't know if someone is here with the clerk's office or George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9410)|
| 2:37:10| I understand that the charge to use the credit card is 3.5% plus $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9430)|
| 2:37:19| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9439)|
| 2:37:20| That's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9440)|
| 2:37:21| It's 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9441)|
| 2:37:23| It's 2.5% plus $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9443)|
| 2:37:25| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9445)|
| 2:37:26| For online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9446)|
| 2:37:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9447)|
| 2:37:28| Across the counter it's 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9448)|
| 2:37:30| Across the counter it's 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9450)|
| 2:37:32| But if they go online to pay for it, then it's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| 2.5% and $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9459)|
| 2:37:40| And we're only accepting MasterCard and Visa at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9460)|
| 2:37:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9464)|
| 2:37:48| Commissioner Mark Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9468)|
| 2:37:51| I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9471)|
| 2:37:52| A number of us received an email from Hubert Smith who was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| You still worried about the figure now that it's 2.5% rather than 3.5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| I was quoting what was said in the Intergovernmental Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| If the figure was wrong, it was wrongly stated and nobody made the correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| That's what's on your tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9490)|
| 2:38:11| But the figure is actually 2.5% plus $1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9491)|
| 2:38:15| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9495)|
| 2:38:16| In person or online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9496)|
| 2:38:18| Online, 2.5%, $1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| Over the counter, 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9503)|
| 2:38:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9507)|
| 2:38:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9508)|
| 2:38:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| Will they know about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9511)|
| 2:38:32| If they're online, will it let them know that they have to pay more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9512)|
| 2:38:36| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9516)|
| 2:38:37| They'll have to approve that there when it comes up on their screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| They want the online service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9521)|
| 2:38:43| Did we try to negotiate that, try to get that even lower or even take it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9523)|
| 2:38:49| We did, but that was a figure that would come back, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9529)|
| 2:38:56| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9536)|
| 2:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9537)|
| 2:38:58| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9538)|
| 2:38:59| On that, George, is that a break even?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9539)|
| 2:39:01| Are you going to have to supplement that figure or is this a break even amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| That is the actual figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9546)|
| 2:39:08| It's a break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9548)|
| 2:39:11| You're not going to make money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| No, we're not going to make any money off this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9554)|
| 2:39:16| You're not going to lose money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9556)|
| 2:39:17| But is it the same if I show up at the counter and pay cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| Is it the same as if I show up and pay with a debit card?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9562)|
| 2:39:28| Debit card, credit card, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| Well, if it's a debit card, is it the same as cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| If you pay cash, you won't be the same, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9574)|
| 2:39:40| Mr. Law Director, can you charge somebody more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| No, no, there's no charge for cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9584)|
| 2:39:47| It's only if you use a credit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9587)|
| 2:39:48| There's an additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| I know, but I didn't know if the law would let you charge somebody more for using a credit card| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9589)|
| 2:39:54| than it would if you walked up and handed them cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9594)|
| 2:39:56| No, and I don't think that's what this is either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9596)|
| 2:39:58| Go ahead, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9598)|

| 2:40:00| Mr. Commissioner, Matt Montefiore, contract coordinator purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| It is the debit and credit card is the same amount, the 2.5% plus a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9603)|
| 2:40:10| It is not the same as cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9610)|
| 2:40:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9612)|
| 2:40:13| And the state law is up to 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9613)|
| 2:40:15| And you can do a convenience fee of a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9615)|
| 2:40:19| It's a convenience fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9619)|
| 2:40:20| It's not cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9620)|
| 2:40:22| I know it's not cash, but if my tags are $60| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9622)|
| 2:40:25| and I come up there with $60 cash, or if I buy the same $60 worth of tags| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9625)|
| 2:40:30| and I throw out my debit card, I'm going to be charged $60 plus 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9630)|
| 2:40:36| You're going to be charged a convenience fee, which is authorized by state law, up to 5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9636)|
| 2:40:41| but there's only a 2.5% fee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9641)|
| 2:40:45| Okay, I just want to make sure that people understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| If you did it online, it would cost you an extra dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| Yeah, I just want people to understand that there's a cost difference in cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9648)|
| 2:40:53| and using a credit card or a debit card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9653)|
| 2:40:55| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9655)|
| 2:40:56| George, so what you're saying is someone could renew their tag online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9656)|
| 2:41:02| and so you would find that out, you'd receive their money from the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9662)|
| 2:41:08| and then I guess we would mail them their sticker or their new plate, or is that how it would work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9668)|
| 2:41:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9678)|
| 2:41:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| They would pay for that up front before we send it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9681)|
| 2:41:23| I guess that's what the dollar is for, is to cover the postage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9683)|
| 2:41:27| Or what covers the postage to mail them their postage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9687)|
| 2:41:36| The postage is included in the online transaction, the 2.5% there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom071022?start=9696)|
