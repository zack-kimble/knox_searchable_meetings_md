| 0:18:13| The policy sets forth formulas for regulating clearing and grading where there's been no enforcement or understood expectation for clearing grading in the county in the past, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1093)|
| 0:18:22| This standard is important because storm water runoff is causing flooding problems that must be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1102)|
| 0:18:29| It was brought to my attention that current EPA standards mandate that the first inch of rainwater must not run off a development at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1109)|
| 0:18:39| This plan puts practices into place that address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| There's concerns whether we're dealing properly with EPA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| As someone else said, this plan wasn't much longer and no more complicated than the tree conservation plan that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1129)|
| 0:18:57| I think they said it was 68 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| They were concerned that the argument that the tree policy plan which is in place is not any more complicated or convoluted than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1139)|
| 0:19:08| Finally, somebody pointed out, I think from the MPC, that the GIS markings of the designated areas are now much better than the hand-drawn markings before and they thought that was a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1148)|
| 0:19:20| That summarizes what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| I don't know if that answers all of our questions, but I think it's fascinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| I think it helps us as we move that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| Any comments or questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| I don't want to spend too much time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| I just told you what they told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| I'm not going to argue fact at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I just share a perception with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| Are we good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| Good with your history of what you learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| Do you understand what they said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Yes, that does not necessarily cover the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Oh, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| All I gave you is what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I wanted you to know what those representative groups said to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| I didn't write down everything everybody said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| I am sure there's somebody out there right now who's saying, you know, he didn't mention what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| But I gave you, I think, the good cross-section of what came from the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| Thank you for helping me clarify that, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1218)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Let's begin our discussion about the topic at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| The way we're going to do this is we will clarify, kind of clarify what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1231)|
| 0:20:47| We're going to discuss the key issues involved in each of these, slope, clearing, and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| I won't really separate density out as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| It becomes part of the slope and clearing discussion, but it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| And then we will analyze strengths and weaknesses on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| And then we'll be able to clarify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| And then we'll talk about options for how to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| How do we meet interests of most groups and stay at the heart of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| You saw I put up here, this is not meant to be comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| It's meant to be a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| I put it on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| This was taken, this particular document was taken directly from the MPC site where the facts and questions section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1282)|
| 0:21:35| And this is what is being proposed to the public as the facts in terms of slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| General plan, let's see if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| General plan 2033, section 76 says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| This is the plan that's currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| It says, 7.6, to reclaim our rights to clean and air water, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| one, restrict development on slopes greater than 15% and along streams and rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Housing densities on 15 to 25% slopes are two dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| Housing densities on slopes greater than 25%, one dwelling per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| Non-residential uses on slopes over 15% via a planned development zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| And flood plains limit uses to 50% in a flood fringe area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| That's the policy that's currently in place as far as I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1352)|
| 0:22:38| You have then, within the plan, policies that can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| And that is page, I believe it's page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Well, I think it's page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| Slope comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| What I want to do before we start the discussion is straight up compare the two policies so you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| I think it's important to kind of cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| There may be a question I'm going to have to ask MPC to qualify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| because it seemed like I saw two different statements, but I'm sure it's my lack of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| not any kind of mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Here we notice it says, comparison one, slopes of less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Any use allowed of property zoning base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| However, where's Mark at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Mark, I don't know if you can answer this, step up and answer this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I also saw in the plan, it said property less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| I believe it said six dwellings per acre within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Can you kind of tell the difference between that statement of any use plus six dwellings per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| With regard to residential uses, and we then look at the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| and the urban growth area versus the planned growth area, city versus county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| So generally in the city or in the urban growth area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| we will use six units per acre as that base to apply to areas less than 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1437)|
| 0:24:04| And in the planned growth areas in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| we will use five units per acre as the maximum to apply to that area below 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| And so the statement of any use allowed is probably not as particularly accurate as that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| The uses certainly are allowed, but any density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| Density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| Density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| I just want to make sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| So the use can be as, but the density, as you see right there under slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| is within the county, five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| I'm not sure we got that right up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1475)|
| 0:24:37| Is that correct, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| And within the city, six units per acre, which isn't a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| And the 15 to 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1488)|
| 0:24:49| Could you repeat that one more time about the density in city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| and the difference between the current regulations and the proposed plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Mark, why don't you say it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Let's just deal with that area, less than 15% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| that would happen to be within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| There is a significant chunk of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| If it's in the city and it's classified as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| we will assign up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| In the county, if it's classified as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| we will assign up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| And then there are some areas where the land-use plan is calling for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| medium-density residential within the HRPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| And in the city, we use up to 24 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| In the county, we use up to 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| And that's for that base area below 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| And there is no change from what I understand from the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| there's no change below 15% within the current policy and the new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| Does that help, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| I just want to repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| There is no change between current policy and new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| On less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Commissioner, if you would put your microphone down when you're talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| I'm not sure about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Here's what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Yes, there's no change, but I think some of these clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| and grading plans is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| That's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| We're talking slope only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Slope only is all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| There's a significant difference in clearing and grading, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| But in terms of slope only, that's our topic at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| Slope only, there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| You mean slope as it affects density is what you're really talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Slope affects grading and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| But slope in terms of density at this point is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| We'll separately talk about clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| It's difficult, Councilman, because they all interact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| and yet trying to sort them out to talk is an interesting conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Slopes between 15% and 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| Once again, if I understand this correctly, there's not a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| A residential use is up to two dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| with various policies being adopted for limited office, medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| commercial uses, including the technology corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| and residential use up to two dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| with limited office density and commercial use on hillside areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Now, in terms of the commercial, there may be some change on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| in terms of the go back to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| I want to talk about residential and low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| There's no change at 15% to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| In terms of medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| The plan recommends that there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| The plan recommends the development of medium density housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| on slopes less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| So you need to see that in terms of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| the plan recommends only less than 15% on commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| or medium density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| So everybody somewhat clear on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1688)|
| 0:28:17| Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1697)|
| 0:28:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| From 15 to 25, I see medium density in both black and blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1702)|
| 0:28:34| What was just said about medium density then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| Yeah, these factors are used in calculating an overall density budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1718)|
| 0:28:45| for a proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| So if a parcel comes in for a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| we would recommend planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| and then we would prepare a density recommendation using these factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| We will use for that area of the property that's less than 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| we will use those base numbers that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| We will also assign, in the 15% to 25% slope range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| a density factor of two units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| regardless of whether the project is medium density or low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| So they will get credit for some units on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| The plan recommends that we put those units on the flat parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1772)|
| 0:29:37| but they would get credit for units for land that has that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| That is unchanged from current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| So clarify this for me because I'm slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| I'm probably the slowest person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| So you're telling me that even though it's listed that there can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| limited office and minimum density commercial on hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| you're saying you're recommending that not take place, but you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| There's an opportunity that may take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| The plan recommends that if you're going to do it in that slope area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| do it with small footprints and use tuck under garage to minimize the disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| So there is a, at what I hear you saying then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| at the residential level there's no change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| but at the medium density there are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1820)|
| 0:30:24| The recommendation is not to build there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| but if they do, there's certain ways they can build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| Current policy speaks to medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1831)|
| 0:30:41| The proposed policy may be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| Yeah, I think the current policy is quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| There's no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| On the location of medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| So this is a change, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| So the medium density would be different because it is now discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| where in the past it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| It recommends the use of smaller footprints and tuck under parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| So on the limited office, on the medium density and commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| that has changed from current practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| Yeah, that would be a new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| So there's been that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| I was about to call Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| and I realized that Brad was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Oh, is Brad there too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| I'll be both of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| So there is no change for residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| but the change for commercial and limited office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1901)|
| 0:31:47| the only change is that it makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| It's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Keep in mind that of the 130,000 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| or minus acres in the proposed hillside and rooftop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| about 98% of it has low density or rural residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1924)|
| 0:32:11| So you're talking about about 2% of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| This is a case, and what you're saying is it hasn't been addressed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| and now it's being addressed at a level of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| And it is a change, as Commissioner Ownby said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| but I wanted to clarify what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Yeah, Mark, I had just one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| and I'll probably ask this about each of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| and each one of the things that we go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| but you said that in medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| if they were, for instance, wanting to put an office or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| they would have to design it differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| or it would be recommended that they design it differently than what they do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| But my question really deals with, you know, I'll call it special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| Would they have the right to appeal that, depending on the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| either to the BZA or to the county commission to say there's certain things about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| Yes, it's, you know, because it doesn't fall into the definition that the MPC has to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| but we feel that there's special circumstances here because of the surrounding slope, the soil type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1992)|
| 0:33:19| You know, there's probably a dozen reasons that could come up that we can't think of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| They would have the right to appeal that, either to the county commission or to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2003)|
| 0:33:31| to allow it to proceed the same way it would now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| And this is sort of a legal question, too, is that how binding is this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| How inflexible is it or how flexible is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| It happens when someone thinks they have a good plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| but yet it would be rejected by the plan the way it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| That issue is addressed in several different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| One, in the event that somebody already has a land use classification and zoning that allows office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| or medium density residential without plan review, the MPC is out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| They go directly to permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| In the case where they are proposing a change in the plan or a change in the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| then MPC is in the position of making a recommendation to the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| So the legislative body is the final arbiter of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| And then in the plan, there is a recommendation for the creation of special commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2070)|
| 0:34:38| and office districts when there are locational or environmental criteria where that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2078)|
| 0:34:46| So that would support the change in the land use plan as well as the change in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| to support commercial or office or medium density residential uses in particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| So you come down talking to somebody like me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| it sounds like what you're saying is that when the commissioner says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| can they appeal it to BZA and or the commission, you're saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2113)|
| 0:35:14| I guess, let me say, the one I'm trying to address are some of these bullet points on page three that was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2114)|
| 0:35:21| It says, this is one of the complaints, we heard this again and again and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| that this plan gives too much control to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| And, I mean, even if the Planning Commission is following it all down, we have the professional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| then we have the MPC itself votes on this, they would have the right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| I mean, even if it's denied, just flat out denied by the MPC because it doesn't meet any of these criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| that you had mentioned, they can't have the special circumstances, they can't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| they still, and I'm sort of asking this to the legal people also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| they would have the right to still appeal this to the appropriate appellate board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2161)|
| 0:36:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| So, I mean, it may give a lot of power to the MPC, but they still have an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| The appeals process would kick in in the event that there is already in place a planned zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2170)|
| 0:36:16| which assigns development plan approval authority to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:22| That decision is appealable in the city to city council in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| That's what I mean by the appropriate appellate board, whether it's the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| county commission, or the BZAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| I've got to confirm that with Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| And, also, I believe there's even statute that's come down recently that confirms that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2200)|
| 0:36:41| Well, there have always been statutes that provide administrative appeals and then eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| and ultimately appeal to the courts of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| So, there won't ever be a land use decision that's not appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| That would be a violation of due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| But decisions that come out of the MPC will be appealable either to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| or the county commission and then eventually to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| So, there's several layers of administrative review and then eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Really, why I mention this is that I think most developers want to keep this out of the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| because things can be tied up for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| And if they have options on, most of the time they have options on land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| and they're not going to buy the land until they have the appropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| But, usually, with the appeals that are made to the city council, the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| or the various BZAs, that can be handled within a month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| which still would fit into an economic timeline that they could deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| When it goes to the courts, it can be a year's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| And most of them would say if it's going to go to the courts then they've lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| because they can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| So, to move us along, I want to confirm that we understand that they can appeal to the elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| if they're unhappy or feel like they have special circumstance with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| From what I see of the plan, it doesn't change the current method of appealing decisions from the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2275)|
| 0:38:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| We're going to move along, but two more comments to Councilman DelVal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| I want to be sure that Mr. Briggs' question is answered with a footnote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2286)|
| 0:38:13| that is clear in the Tennessee statute, which I have in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| TCA 133304B, the new B that's effective July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| says if the legislative body adopts the general regional plan in the form of an ordinance or a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2304)|
| 0:38:31| then any land use decisions thereafter made by the legislative body, the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2311)|
| 0:38:38| the board of zoning appeals, and I'll skip some words, must be consistent with the general regional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| So, if the plan has a requirement as opposed to a fuzzy section, then you have to abide by the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2324)|
| 0:38:53| Where you appeal it to a court or whatever is fine, but the standard is in the state statute, which empowers all of us to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| I wouldn't disagree with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| What's meant by fuzzy section of the plan or recommendation, whether it's a mandatory part of the recommendation or a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2345)|
| 0:39:14| that depends on the language of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And I agree that land use decisions that are made after the adoption of the general plan must be consistent with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2357)|
| 0:39:25| But I reiterate, there are several layers of administrative review and appeal to the city council or the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2365)|
| 0:39:31| before that specific portion of the plan will be interpreted and whether the decision is consistent with the plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2371)|
| 0:39:41| There's a level of interpretation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| So, if you're talking to a guy from Texas, which means I'm not that bright, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| So, what I hear you saying is any, because, you know, Councilman DelVolpe read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| But what I hear you saying, any can be appealed to the elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| Now, whether they change it or do whatever, they still have to be consistent with the plan, but the appeal is allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| I'm not taking away the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| I'm just saying it's the standard in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| The plan is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| Then there are land use decisions that will be based on the plan that are made after the plan that must be consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Those decisions can be appealed through the administrative process and eventually and ultimately to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2422)|
| 0:40:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Councilman Brown, Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| I just have a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| What we are looking at here, the current plan, is this applying to both county and city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2432)|
| 0:40:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| The general plan, I believe, applies to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2442)|
| 0:40:43| Let's move through because we will talk more about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| Also see that at the 25 to 40 percent range, residential uses are at one dwelling per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2445)|
| 0:40:55| That doesn't change at residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| At 40 to 50 is a residential low-density change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| Residential uses up to one dwelling per two acres is allowed currently, and now it's proposed it's one dwelling per four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| Over 50 percent residential uses, one dwelling per two acres, and proposed is no development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| I believe Ridgetop has to be through a specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| We don't have that listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| We'll talk about Ridgetop later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| That's the basics of that particular understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2481)|
| 0:41:27| As you can tell in this conversation, it just goes all kinds of directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2487)|
| 0:41:35| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Who am I asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Under slopes over 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| I mean, I know this is just the synopsis version of these changes, but if it says no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2502)|
| 0:41:53| it should also be stated that there is possible under special circumstances or special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2513)|
| 0:42:02| Is that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| On slopes over 50 percent, I believe everybody on the task force, regardless of their bent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| agreed that there ought not to be any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2534)|
| 0:42:17| And what that recommendation is saying is that when we prepare that budget of density in making our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| we are going to give no credit for that portion of the property over 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2545)|
| 0:42:31| Would you consider a driveway up to my flat-top mountain development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| If that's the only way to reach a flat spot on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| then we have proposed in the plan smaller right-of-ways and smaller street profiles to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2562)|
| 0:42:51| My understanding was there would be a special district for that type of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| What do you call it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| A hilltop district or something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| There was supposed to be a special district set up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| I mean, it had very serious and controlling rules and limitations, but it's not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2585)|
| 0:43:13| Well, if you're speaking about development on top of the ridge, which would be probably a flat spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2593)|
| 0:43:20| but accessible only through a steeply sloped portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| we would, through the use of the planned residential zone district and the development plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2607)|
| 0:43:34| try to site the development on the flat part and minimize the disturbance to the steeply sloped portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2614)|
| 0:43:43| What you'll be able to build is driveway up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| If that's the only way to access that flat spot, then, you know, that's the way you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2625)|
| 0:43:54| So, real quickly, let's talk a few minutes about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| When you see that slope, what is it you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| That's all we're going to talk about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| What is it you like about that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| What are you supportive of within this that we need to be thinking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| You're talking density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Well, slope and density, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| We're talking about the slope and density relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| What do you like about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2658)|
| 0:44:23| The slope part only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Slope-density relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Well, there's no change except for the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| So, it is similar except very few changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2671)|
| 0:44:39| There are a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Let's stay with support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| We'll come to changes in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| Do you want to add on something in support of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| So, what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| I mean, is that pretty much what you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| There's very few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Anything else you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| It looks and feels a lot like what we've got already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| We've noted that there's flexibility within the plan that will allow for circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| So, if you have special circumstances that can be built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| Could you hit the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| There's a gradation of the amount of units that are allowed the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| the more density being allowed at the lower slopes and less at the higher ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2726)|
| 0:45:34| And you like the idea of the density being further down the mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2734)|
| 0:45:39| I think it's sensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| That seems sensible to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Anything else about this slope density relationship that you want to bring forward to support it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| This really is sort of what Tony said about flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| There's an appeals process for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| Anyone else want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| So, it sounds like coming in, you are fairly consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| It looks and feels a whole lot like what we've already got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| There are some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| But within those changes, some of you say you like the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| You like the ability to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| And at least one of you or some of you like the idea of the density being pushed down to the flatter parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| and there's gradation going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| Whereas, in the current plan, there's only two gradations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| There's below a certain point and above a certain point, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| And you like the gradation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Anything else you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| We'll make sure we kind of get those on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2807)|
| 0:46:54| Well, let's talk about what concerns you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| Some of that has come up already, but I want you to restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| And restate it as succinctly as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| What is it about this slope density relationship that concerns you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| Basically, it's sound, but there is this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| It is possible with good engineering to come up with a plan that doesn't fit that mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2831)|
| 0:47:18| I don't know if there's that much flexibility in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| So, for example, if the criteria were specified, you know, with some precision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| what you had to achieve in terms of you could only clear so much of the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| or you could only do certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| you might come up with a density that's higher or more intense than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| and yet still be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| But I don't see that as really allowed under here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| So some of the flexibility may be taken out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| In other words, good engineering could come up with a different perspective than the rigid rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| What I hear you saying is you understand flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| You have questions about how flexible it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| I don't want to say something you're not saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2878)|
| 0:47:59| That would be the concern here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| If someone comes in and they engineer something really well and it makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| but it violates the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| They engineer it and they have low profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| You can't see it under a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| They run the roads with the contour of the hill and not against them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| so there's less runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| They've used materials that blend in and look like the forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| They're in greens and tans and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| They've done the things that minimize the impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| and yet it would seem to me that the density is absolute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| that you really can't propose that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| You might as well just scratch it because you're not going to get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| So you have some loss of flexibility as a tradeoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| So you're asking about your concern about just enough flexibility for good engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Any other concerns about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Can you expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Help me understand that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| I don't think one plan fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| I mean, every piece of property is uniquely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| And your concern is that this doesn't address that variety of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| That's where you need that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2951)|
| 0:49:20| Mark, are you wanting to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| The plan addresses that flexibility in a couple of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| in that it provides for density bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| It recommends the provision of density bonuses for certain performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| particularly the setting aside of land in undisturbed condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| and then also making it accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| But in the case that Nick was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| if someone had a plan such as that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| and came in for a rezoning request with the plan in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| and it met all of the land use plan criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| I suspect that there would be a good chance of getting the zoning approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| to make that plan happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3011)|
| 0:50:14| Currently, with planned development zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| it's done in a two-step process where they simply get the zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| and we provide the maximum density in step one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| and then the development plan comes at a much later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| If someone had a plan in hand when they made the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| and it performed like Nick was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| I would say that the chances of getting that rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| as long as it was consistent with the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| which is either ag and rural residential for most of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| and ridgetop protection area, one unit to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| or with the planned growth and low-density residential standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| So what I hear you saying is you guys would look at having flexibility in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| We'll talk about this more in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| but also that they still have the right to appeal to the body also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| I'll call back in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| They have the right to provide us more information on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| than is conventionally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Any other concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3082)|
| 0:51:26| I want to mention one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| We got a letter from the attorney from the Chamber of Commerce, Tom McFaul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I mean, this is a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Is the plan legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| Just a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| You probably saw the letter, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| We are reviewing the letter and the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| There aren't any parts of the plan that jump out as being void or extremely vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| so we're reviewing the plan and notify you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| So at this point from the conversation I had with Joe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| his response to me, and I'm doing this as hearsay only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| so I've got to be careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| that he didn't say anything per se that was illegal about that document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3126)|
| 0:52:09| but you guys would review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| That is my sense as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| In the law department's defense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3134)|
| 0:52:15| they did not get a copy of that until about 2.30 this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| And so you guys are going to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| and then issue an opinion for the members of the Counseling Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| I'll defer to my law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| Well, that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Question along those same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3155)|
| 0:52:36| And we're still talking about slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Well, I'm wanting to maybe amplify the concern in that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3158)|
| 0:52:47| did you say that that's the answer to that concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Because I'd like to address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| The answer about being illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| That they hadn't seen, from what I understand in terms of hearsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| that they hadn't seen anything that jumps out as illegal per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| but they're reviewing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| and I'm sure they're going to get back with you with their opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| Is that where you're standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| From what I can see, the memo raised three or four issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| One was the argument that this is too vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3191)|
| 0:53:17| You can't tell if it reasonably applies to a particular piece of property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| Another was there hasn't been proper due process in enacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| or adopting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Currently, the plan hasn't been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| It's not binding on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| So there's more process to be gone through before the plan's operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| And there were a couple of other concerns that were similar to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| But just to reiterate, nothing jumps out as illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| So we're not going to issue, you know, make a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| We're not going to defer that to legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3232)|
| 0:53:53| They can get back with you as quickly as possible on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| Okay, so I tend to agree with his general comments as it relates to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3237)|
| 0:54:04| you know, being not a huge deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| But I guess I would like for if the law director issues a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| that that's somehow vetted through the state or someone like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| I'll let you guys manage that process from the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| We're going to try to stay on task with this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| This is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Just as a matter of clarification of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3271)|
| 0:54:35| Okay, we need to make it quick, though, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| Okay, real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| We sent the letter to the city law director, the county law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| and the city council law director a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| We sent it to you guys when we saw on the agenda that you were going to discuss legalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3285)|
| 0:54:54| and McAdams was going to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| So we sent it to you as an advisory, but both law departments have had it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| That we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Okay, so you guys will look at that and get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3303)|
| 0:55:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Back to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| It's an important discussion, but I think that's going to have to be handled out of legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| and brought back to us rather than discussing it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| Any other right here, any other concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| I want to make sure they're there, vetted in terms of the slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3320)|
| 0:55:39| With this in mind, we need to talk about where we are with this, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| I mean, there's really about two or three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| They're obvious ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| One is, this is so much like what we've got that everybody in general feels like this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3349)|
| 0:55:55| And that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| Or the other is, you know, this is so awful that we don't want to even chase the slope density discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| Or the third may be, what are areas that perhaps we could be more flexible on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| And I guess my question I want to ask right now, are there areas that you'd like to see more flexibility within this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| I'm not saying we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| I'm just saying I'm wondering if it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| Are there areas you felt like there ought to be more flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| or ought to be some kind of amendment or addressing to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| When you were talking with people yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| was there any concern over the fact there was no development on slopes over 50%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| And so you'd like to, what would be your recommendation with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| I was just asking if that was a concern that was brought up in any of your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3403)|
| 0:56:46| if anyone had used that as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3408)|
| 0:56:49| Within my meetings, that was not brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| There was a question definition of ridgetop, which we can talk about later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| But that particular one wasn't brought up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| I think one of the concerns that's been brought up to me, and it's not from the development people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| it's more from the private citizens about the over 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| being it's their land and now they can't build anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| So that's the concern that they brought to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Do you guys see any, is there any interest in, let's talk about that particular one, the 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3436)|
| 0:57:26| Is there interest in this room of allowing development over 50% in Hawaii?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| Certain circumstances, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| Okay, circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| You're saying, say it to me real clear, because like I said, I don't listen real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Well, as Councilman Bailey pointed out earlier, each piece of land is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and that's why we need flexibility in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| But to tell somebody that they've got 50% land that they cannot ever put anything on to me would be, you know, totally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| But there are special instances where things could be done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| but it needs to be done with special criteria for that it protects not only them but the ones below them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3482)|
| 0:58:11| Mark, I'm going to come back to you in a second, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3491)|
| 0:58:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| So you're saying you understand that if somebody wants to do that under special circumstances with specific criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3500)|
| 0:58:26| there should be a way for them to build at that level, that you would like to see that kind of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| But the reason my light is on is not to limit that strictly to the 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3511)|
| 0:58:37| but there are cases in a couple, you know, between 25 and 40, for instance, or maybe even 15 to 25 that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3517)|
| 0:58:46| I know that's taken care of with some of the move my units down and put them here, there and the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| But there are still certain circumstances where that, as Nick mentioned a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| if a plan comes in that it is, you know, a super-duper plan and it takes all these things into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3535)|
| 0:59:04| then they should be allowed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| And so what I want to summarize and make sure I'm right on this, at this point now, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| I'm going to have you come back up and I'm going to ask you a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| So he comes back and he says, we want to make sure that if they want to build certain things at certain levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| there's a process with criteria that they can follow that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| Is that capable of doing that in the plan or does that need to be amended to the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3569)|
| 0:59:37| The recommendation in the plan is to assign certain densities to rezoning cases based on that formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3577)|
| 0:59:45| So if somebody has property that's 20% sloped over 50% on that 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| they would get zero credits towards their budget of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| That doesn't mean that they can't develop the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| That flexibility would come at the time of the development plan process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| where we would look at where those units ought to be sited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| those units that are allowed under the density calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| where they ought to be sited on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| and how do you go about minimizing the disturbance to the natural landforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3616)|
| 1:00:21| So the table probably could have been written more clearly to say that these are criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3621)|
| 1:00:32| or factors in calculating a density factor or a density credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| See, that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| It's written rigidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| And if people understand that you're saying now is there is some flexibility in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| that takes away a lot of the heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3648)|
| 1:00:52| So what I hear you saying is you would like to see some clarity about that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3659)|
| 1:01:01| So right now I come back and I hear only two things, basically, in flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| See some flexibility in terms of special circumstance, special criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| and some clarity about how that's described within language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| so people understand it doesn't seem so rigid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Those seem to be the areas of flexibility someone would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Mr. Coleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Yeah, just to expand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| I mean, if you look at this as a private citizen, not as a developer, but as a private citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3683)|
| 1:01:30| 50% of your land, if we're looking at that, the slope at 50% or above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3690)|
| 1:01:35| and say it's 50% of your land, you've devalued that property by saying they cannot build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| A lot of loans and mortgages and stuff are based on property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| And if that goes down, then they're going to have to readjust loans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| or may or may not have to, but they're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| By saying that they can't develop, I would like to see that it doesn't say no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3717)|
| 1:02:04| that it says maybe case by case, or more specific than just special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| Because if not, we're going to have a lot of appeals being come across every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| So you're saying you would like to see, within the document itself, specificity about development at 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| That's what scares people now because it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| So anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| We're just looking at areas where people like to see some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Anybody else want to add to this particular document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3753)|
| 1:02:39| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| Are you ready to move on to the discussion of clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| Is everybody relative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| I want you to leave here having a more clear understanding of the slope and density issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Everybody feel like they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| Where we were, where we are, and what the key issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| and areas that you may need to find some ways whether you want to address those flexibility or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| We good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| Either I'm doing really good or really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| I was just going to say these points that Commissioner Owen B. and Brown and Bailey made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| I understand these points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| And I think in certain instances you have a developer that comes in and he's creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| Now we have GIS technology where you can read land better than you used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| And there might be some instances where, with a particular approach, this should be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3809)|
| 1:03:35| And I understand the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| And if they could find language that would put that in there but still keep the general plan, you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3818)|
| 1:03:43| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| And to reiterate, I think we have technology now that might actually be used as a tool for developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3824)|
| 1:03:52| who want to build in places that normally, just looking at the old way of looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| you say, well, you can't build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| But there's a possibility that now we have technology that says, you know, at first blush,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3840)|
| 1:04:04| it looks like we couldn't build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| But we can use this now to where actually we know you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| You guys are coming to some pretty good points, coming to a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| Anybody else understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| You're clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| We can move on to the degrading, clearing, and density discussion from here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Can you help me for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Would you take these and put these on the wall over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3868)|
| 1:04:37| The world's largest Post-it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Listen, when I do all day things, we just cover the whole place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3879)|
| 1:04:47| Come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| I know you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Pull that off and just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3892)|
| 1:05:23| If you'll turn to page one, I guess, or page four, it's in purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3923)|
| 1:05:30| Now, let me get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Page one in pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3932)|
| 1:05:43| Now, you'll notice in the back, the Planning Commission did a more in-depth analysis of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3943)|
| 1:05:51| both slope and also clearing that they were able to get out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3951)|
| 1:05:56| They put that in your packet for additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| But this is a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| This is how I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Based on discussions with different people, I'm sure that others could help clarify it as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3962)|
| 1:06:08| Number one, current clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| The city and county engineering departments issued the permits for clearing and grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| in the city and county, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| The city has a provision of saving six trees per acre, but the code goes on to allow complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3978)|
| 1:06:24| clearing if topography and other constraints pose difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| In that case, eight new trees require to be planted per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| All the city falls under this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| The county has neither conservation nor planning provisions except for preserving a buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3993)|
| 1:06:38| next to streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| The proposed clearing and grading plan, the hillside plan recommends a generalized clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| formula, which you can see at the bottom, which is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| The concept is the formula would use to make a recommendation in rezoning cases for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| amount of clearing on hillside only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| If a party with an interest in developing the land believes the formula to be inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| the Planning Commission or appropriate legislative body could alter the clearing recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| When a recommendation is made to limit clearing, the MPC staff would have to take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| during the site plan and concept plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| The site plan concept plan is required before subdividing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| The site plan would include areas of provisions for non-disturbance in similar proportion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| that which is approved by the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| In the city, the Planning Commission could alter the non-disturbance area should the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| city council and the county, the Planning Commission, the county commission as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| as the Board of Zoning Appeals could alter the non-disturbance area if the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| is appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| With that, in terms of clearing, at 0 to, you can see it up there, 0 to 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4061)|
| 1:07:48| 100 percent clearing is allowed, 15 to 25 percent, 50 percent clearing is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| And here's where I need some clarification from two things I've read, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4076)|
| 1:08:00| I need you to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| This is what I pulled off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Is this accurate or is there a point where no clearing is allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| But you see the 15 to, 100 percent at 0 to 15, 15 to 25 at 50, 25 to 40, and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4087)|
| 1:08:14| off the plan, 10 percent at 40 to 50, 50 plus, no development, and then ridge top, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| would actually have to be a specific site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Is that accurate or is there anything else you need to add to that to clarify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| It's accurate and its intent, again, probably could have been written differently in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4107)|
| 1:08:37| the intent is for this to be used much the same way that we use the density factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| whereby with slope and density we're applying those at the rezoning stage with clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4123)|
| 1:08:50| and grading, and these factors we would be applying at the development plan and concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Second stage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| Step two of zoning and step one of subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| Same plan, two different names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| Development plan is associated with zoning, concept plan is associated with subdividing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4145)|
| 1:09:12| but they are literally the same plan in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| And we would prepare an overall budget, again, based on these factors and apply it to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4156)|
| 1:09:22| plan that's proposed and ultimately approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| There is, again, that same appeal process in the city to the city council, in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| to the BZA on development plan approval decisions by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| But it doesn't necessarily say that on every chunk of a parcel that is over 40 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| or over 50 percent you can't clear trees, it simply says that when we prepare an overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4188)|
| 1:09:53| budget we're going to give no credit for that, or we're going to give credit for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| of the trees that exist on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| And tell me, like I said, I learn slow, the reason for the percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4201)|
| 1:10:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| The general policy is that the steeper the slope, the more we want to leave it undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| Primarily to promote the, or to minimize the amount of water runoff and erosion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4218)|
| 1:10:27| can result from clearing steeply sloped lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| All the science points to starting those kinds of considerations at 15 percent and as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4232)|
| 1:10:39| slopes increase to minimize the amount of disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4239)|
| 1:10:44| So that formula is calibrated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Is there someone here from the soil or science, I might have had, may have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| Could you step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| Before you get there, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| I'm sorry, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Mark was saying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| Step back, we'll let them finish this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I wasn't sure that I got it because it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| He was saying that the 15 percent, I mean I think the 50 percent, who's going to quarrel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4271)|
| 1:11:16| with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| But the 15 percent and the 10 percent clearing limitations, were you saying those are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| absolutes but they go to whether or not you get a credit for bonuses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| Because there's a real difference about how much you clear and we hear lots of complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4287)|
| 1:11:31| about, you know, I might have to clear a wider road than 24 feet to build it, I mean, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4291)|
| 1:11:36| order to get my equipment in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4298)|
| 1:11:39| So, what is the clearing percentage limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| What does it mean again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| Let me see if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| It's used the same way that we use the density factors in that the numbers are used to prepare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4305)|
| 1:11:52| an overall budget for clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| So, you could end up with a parcel that says that you can clear 73 percent of that total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| And then look to find the places where we can save 27 percent of that parcel in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4325)|
| 1:12:13| undisturbed case and we would look first to the most deeply sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| But you could have a case where next to a stream where we have a requirement that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| you have trees you need to save them for 75 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4343)|
| 1:12:27| But we're going to give you credit for taking 100 percent of that area if it's below 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| feet slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| What if I've got this 10 acres and it's in this 25 to 40 percent range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4355)|
| 1:12:40| Am I limited to a total amount of area clearing of 15 percent in terms of literally the percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| of the land mass or is that only for calculating whether I get a zero bonus or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4368)|
| 1:12:54| In other words, how restrictive is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| He's wanting to know how restrictive that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| If, for example, your parcel was entirely within one range and it was 15 to 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| you would be allowed to clear 50 percent of the total parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| Right, and I'm saying that one's not very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| When you get down to 15 or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| The 25 and up is what I think he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| Yeah, and the data indicates that there is, I think it's like 8,000 acres of the 130| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4397)|
| 1:13:27| are sloped 50 percent or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| So, it's a relatively small proportion of the total area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| Don't go to the 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| Go to the, you know, it's the middle range there that has the most land in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| We're looking at the 25 to 40 percent has 25 percent of the land and 40 to 50 has seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| So, you're talking about 32 percent of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| Are you limited to that percentage or is that only for calculating a zero bonus because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4428)|
| 1:13:53| you did, I don't know, you cleared 18 percent and not 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4433)|
| 1:13:59| There are no recommendations for bonuses based on clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| So, it's an absolute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| You cannot clear as a percentage of the land, 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| That's the recommended budget going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| And certainly, if through the development plan approval process, we all acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4453)|
| 1:14:19| that, okay, the formula says 68 percent but you're coming in at 70 and you've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| the best job that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| So, help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| This is how I describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| I want to make sure that I understand it and then maybe the councilman can help, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| it will help him a little bit too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| So, you're saying those aren't credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| That's fairly absolute coming in on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| You may repeal it and there may be other plans you can make changes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| But if you're developing land and all the land is between 40, 25 percent and 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| then you can clear 15 percent of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Now, there can be appeals and there can be special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| But that's not written as a highly flexible model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| You just need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| If your parcel is entirely between 25 and 40 percent, you're going to have half a unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4509)|
| 1:15:20| So, you're going to have two acre minimum lots, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| And with 8,000 to 10,000 square feet in a lot, you can find a buildable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4524)|
| 1:15:33| So, coming back to that, councilman, did you get your question answered as far as it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| Yeah, but I'm picturing if I have a subdivision or I'm developing it, I've got a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| I've got the parcel where I've got to put the house footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| the fire codes want me to clear a little bit outside of the reaches of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| so you can get around it and put out a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| I'm just trying to figure out whether...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| So, you're trying to figure out that's a reasonable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| Is it too small is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| So, what I hear you saying, I want to make sure I understand you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| is you're concerned about is 15 percent a reasonable amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| and you were asking how much flexibility was tied into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Is that what I heard you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| We were given an example at one of the workshops where MPC appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| where they showed a piece of land that had a combination turf, flat land and a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| And, of course, the goal was to direct more of the development and denser development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4577)|
| 1:16:21| down low, but if you have essentially a steep piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4581)|
| 1:16:25| is the absolute limit 15 percent when you're in the 25 to 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| So, when we come back to concerns, that needs to be something we make sure we put up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| One question real quick, come back here to the science guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| In terms of stormwater runoff, what do we need to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| We're talking about clearing and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| What are one or two things or some specific things we need to know about stormwater runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| that will affect this, if anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| Well, in terms of stormwater runoff, you're regulated already by virtue of EPA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| through the MPDS permit that Knox County and the city of Knoxville has to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| You know, that's pertaining to one inch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| and there are regulations already that you have to control the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4637)|
| 1:17:25| The best way that I could think to illustrate what happens in the natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4645)|
| 1:17:33| versus developed scenario is to give you the diagram that all of you all have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| that shows the difference in the amount of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Yes, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| How you change the amount of evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| whenever you go from a natural setting to a disturbed setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4670)|
| 1:17:56| And a lot of that is due to soil compaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4676)|
| 1:17:59| Water doesn't infiltrate compacted soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| So, it changes it drastically, and obviously with a steeper slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| your erosion potential is much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4686)|
| 1:18:09| Your ability to be able to retain that first inch is much harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4689)|
| 1:18:17| What David was suggesting is exactly what I was looking at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| And also, when you remove much of the vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| and you remove much of the root system that is holding that soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| your energy level of the water goes up greatly as the slope increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| So, removing more vegetation at higher slopes will increase erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4716)|
| 1:18:41| and also increase runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| When you're looking at runoff potential once land is cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| and denuded of vegetation, it goes up about five-fold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| for what it would be in a natural state in trees and other vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| because rainfall energy is impacted greatly by hitting the canopy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| of whatever plants are there, slowing it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| and making it much less erosive and much less viable for runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| as it is falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| I'm sorry. Go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| And so, what I hear you say basically is the things that we need to be aware of here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| is number one, there is an EPA standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| And was I correct when I said one inch of the first...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| Could you kind of clarify that standard real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| The one inch rule is a fairly new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| It was issued in phase two of the NPDES regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| So, that originates with EPA who passes it to TDEC in our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| and then TDEC sends it to the local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| And regardless of this plan, all that's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| Knox County and City of Knoxville have to enforce stormwater ordinances right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| And there's no choice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| But how a developer handles the land greatly impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| whether or not they can be in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Hey, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| If we could ask any of the speakers to just give their name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4814)|
| 1:20:18| That's fabulous. All right. Could you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| And any affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| David Vandegraaff, UT Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| I'm a certified arborist and certified professional horticulturist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| Neil Denton, UT Extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Director here in Knox County of the UT Extension office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| I'm an agronomist and horticulturist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Any questions of these guys before I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Of course, they'll still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| I was wondering if David or Neil would apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4848)|
| 1:20:53| some of what they just said to the specific questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| that Nick had about the 25 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| And by that, I mean, when I think from conversations that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| on the task force with developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| they're very adverse to going in to places like 25 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| They're very vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| Those are not desirable places for reasons that you all just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4881)|
| 1:21:27| You just can't do it with economy and any carefulness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| But I was just wondering if you all had any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| relative to what Nick was concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| about a site that was primarily, if not all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| within a 25 to 40 percent range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| Because just looking at a number like 15 percent clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4906)|
| 1:21:50| that does seem harsh, maybe, from a developer's standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| But is it reasonable to you all from a soil...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| And keep that from a soil perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| As a soil scientist perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| is there anything you can add to that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| That's what we want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| I think the big thing to keep in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| is look at the amount of land you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| If it's restricted to 15 percent on the 25 to 40 percent slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| but you're talking about two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| 15 percent of two acres is a good amount of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| I think it would be unreasonable to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4947)|
| 1:22:32| that a developer wouldn't have room to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| with that amount of land they could disturb on that large a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| So what I want you to focus on is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| from a soil science perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| is the question he's asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| is the 15 percent kind of in that reasonable range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4967)|
| 1:22:51| or can you not really say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| I mean, what you know is the runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| but there's not really a formula that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| within a certain amount you can develop this much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| to manage storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Is there anything...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| I guess that's what I'm looking...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| I'm looking for simplicity, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| Is there anything that just says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| oh yeah, there's this formula and this is how you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| There is formulas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| But the problem is, as we, in this discussion, I see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| it's case by case because it deals with slope length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4995)|
| 1:23:19| with soil type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| with all of those different things that come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| and also what the previous use of the land was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| and also how much of the soil has already been eroded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| in the past by agriculture and other uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| because most of the land that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| in the 25 to 40 percent range was once farmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| So a lot of the soil has already been lost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| and that comes into the equation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| But 15 percent is a reasonable amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| to allow on two acres, two dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| You're going to look at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| where you've got three-tenths of an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5035)|
| 1:23:57| to use for the footprint for the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| or in the placing of landscape, lawn, and a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| So that is going to be a reasonable amount in most situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| However, our slopes here are so small in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| Slopes change drastically over small reaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| In hundreds, in tens and hundreds of feet we're talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| where in other places we'd be talking thousands of feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| And that can come into play as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| But overall, 15 percent seems pretty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| So from a soil science perspective, that seems reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| We may call on you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Councilman Della Volpe is coming from a development perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| that that seems restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| So we have those two concepts that are floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| Let me add a thought, and that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| they were talking about EPA and Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| The Tennessee general construction permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| was adopted on May 23, 2011, after this plan was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| And it is in effect for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| Some things haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| When you come in to develop anything more than one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| you must file a stormwater pollution prevention plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| that says how you're going to deal with erosion and sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| and siltation and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| And it has to be prepared by an engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| a licensed engineer or a landscape architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| or someone who's taken the design courses provided by TDEC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| to enable them to be able to show that they are dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| Now, it's true, the more you clear, the more erosion, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| The less trees absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| Tree roots hold the world together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| And you take them down, you have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| And the same is true with other vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| But there are buffers in there for if you're near an undamaged stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| You've got to be 60 feet back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| No equipment, nothing happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| You've got to stay away from the stream bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| So there are rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| There are inspection requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| And I guess the question is, this rule seems absolute again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5162)|
| 1:26:08| And Mark was addressing, well, later when you come in with engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5168)|
| 1:26:14| if you get that far, perhaps you can show a design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| that's really intelligent and avoids not using that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| But I think the 15% clearing is absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| I wonder when you add roads in addition to the footprint for the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| and the clearing for fire protection, whether that's a good number or a bad number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5192)|
| 1:26:36| Our neighboring city, Sevierville, uses 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5196)|
| 1:26:39| I don't know whether that's a good number or a bad number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| I'm just saying that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| You're asking a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| Yeah, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| Yes, and so what I hear in summary, real quick on this one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| in terms of rainwater, obviously we know that the more undeveloped land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| the less runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| And the question you had is, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| And by the way, we're held to that already within the current rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| We have ways of dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| It doesn't prevent runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| The rules make you deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| Deal with runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5226)|
| 1:27:07| Here they're saying this is one way to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| And you're asking the question, is that reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Mother Nature's way of managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| Less clearing is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| The question is, is it too restrictive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| That's the question we're asking, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| We can clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| We can move to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| When you talk about the percentage of land that can be cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5242)|
| 1:27:25| how do you take into account land that's already cleared in your development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5250)|
| 1:27:31| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5251)|
| 1:27:32| Can you answer that one real quick, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| If land, if you're, I hear you saying, if I get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| If I'm not clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| And 20 acres are already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| Already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Does that, how does that affect the clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| Is that counted into the clearing already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5264)|
| 1:27:51| The plan makes a recommendation as far as these clearing factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5271)|
| 1:27:58| If that recommendation is then run within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| and an ordinance is created to codify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| we would have to have some provisions in there for dealing with existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| But if it's already cleared and your budget exceeds that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| then we're going to try to direct your development into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| to utilize that cleared space first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| and then eat into the uncleared space as the budget allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| So you're saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| I mean, right now, the way it stands, the cleared space needs to be counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| You say that maybe there may be some kind of ordinance later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| that may deal with previously cleared land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| But at this point, it is considered part of the clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| If the already cleared space exceeds your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| then we would use the limits of the existing cleared space on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| Do you hear what he's saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| He says yes, in essence, until it's dealt differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| See, that's the great thing about not being that bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| I can say stuff really short, you know, and no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| I mean, we had kind of the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| To me, every piece of property is different as it stands today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| and it just gets very fuzzy when you get into what's already been cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5354)|
| 1:29:19| and what part of the property it's already cleared on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| versus where you would like to develop or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| And so every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Then we're going to move to the support and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| We're doing the concerns right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| so I want to do it in a kind of more orderly manner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Right, so definitely understand what Councilman Bailey was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| but I guess I'd like an answer maybe from the soil guys or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5386)|
| 1:29:51| I hadn't seen anyone necessarily argue that Mother Nature's way is that these numbers are accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5391)|
| 1:29:59| and the statement was made, I guess we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| Is Mother Nature's way too restrictive I think is what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| I said leaving land in the natural form is Mother Nature's way of dealing with runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| It's absorbed by the tree roots and grass roots and bushes and shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| It's slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| It's decelerated, and so it causes less erosion, less siltation, less problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5418)|
| 1:30:24| But, again, you deal with that by engineering as well when you clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| That's what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Well, I guess my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| I think what I heard was that these numbers, this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| embraces Mother Nature's way in a way that we can do as much development as folks deem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5437)|
| 1:30:44| I guess my comment is, and maybe Nick starts to answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5444)|
| 1:30:49| I've not seen an engineered way of necessarily dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5449)|
| 1:30:56| I know they tend to pines and whatnot, but I'm not for its development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| So I'd like to see something on your paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5462)|
| 1:31:03| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5463)|
| 1:31:04| So what I hear you guys saying, and this is just trying to figure this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| is basically both of you agree that Mother Nature's way is a really efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| positive way to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| You would say, what I heard you say, Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| was that when you develop you have to engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| You have to engineer around the runoff you create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| And they're coming back saying-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Or requires you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5484)|
| 1:31:25| Or requires you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| You should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| They're saying what this does, they're developing a plan that will use more of Mother Nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| to manage that and less of the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| Is that kind of what I understand you guys saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| In the simplest-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5499)|
| 1:31:40| Remember-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5501)|
| 1:31:42| We've got to put it in Steve words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5502)|
| 1:31:43| You really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| You have to dumb it down or we don't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| For example, if you clear a space and you make a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| and you use pervious bricks that allow water to penetrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| you have sort of used Mother Nature's way in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| but you have cleared that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5515)|
| 1:31:56| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| You've restored part of it by trying to use the water back into the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| All right, so kind of moving to the next step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| what is it you find supportive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| What do you like about the clearing density discussion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| What is it you can get behind you feel like is a good thing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5531)|
| 1:32:17| I think it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| I hadn't heard anyone say anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| When you mean it works, what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Would you be real specific about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| It meets the law, as the gentleman pointed out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| It also allows for, and we can argue the point how much, how little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| it allows for development while meeting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| and understanding the nature of these slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5567)|
| 1:32:55| So it provides for kind of Mother Nature within the slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5575)|
| 1:33:00| and it allows for at least some development is what I hear you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| Anybody else, kind of what do you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5583)|
| 1:33:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Anybody want to add anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| I'll make sure I don't leave anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| Commissioner Burrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| I'll just second what Sam said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| I think it does allow for development while still providing some necessary protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5600)|
| 1:33:29| And I think also, like what Nick was saying about the pervious materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5609)|
| 1:33:35| that's an area that's developing really fast with new stuff coming out all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5615)|
| 1:33:41| And I think that those sorts of materials are only going to improve from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5621)|
| 1:33:46| So I'm actually looking forward to seeing what's going to be available next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| in five years, in ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| I think that this will only improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| So you're supporting those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Anybody, Commissioner Norman, want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| This may be a bit of an expansion of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| I don't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5649)|
| 1:34:10| It's not that I'm ignoring you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| I just didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| The issue of what David and Neil just presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| it's consistent with what science tells us about how soils work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| and how problematic erosion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| and what we need to do as best we can in development practices to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5665)|
| 1:34:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Anyone else want to add something else to this support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| Yes, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| I guess, quite simply, it's protective of property rights and property values down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5677)|
| 1:34:46| You know what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| That's a spell check because I misspelled a word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| That's the old manual spell check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5692)|
| 1:34:53| Right there, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5696)|
| 1:34:57| You know, they said never do math and spell in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| That's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| So it's protective of property rights downstream, downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5701)|
| 1:35:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| What about concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Now, here's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| I want to make sure I get this correct from Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| He's not sitting there saying 15% is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| I just don't know if that's too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| I have concerns about that and the absoluteness of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5721)|
| 1:35:25| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| I'm saying that, and I'm saying that our neighbor to the, what would that be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| southeast, which is Sevier County, has said that, you know, let's use 30% clearing as the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5730)|
| 1:35:37| Let's require that there be a certain amount of tree cover that if you take it out, you replace the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| And you went in your little listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| You went where Knoxville, the city, has some placing requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| Replacement policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5749)|
| 1:35:50| The county doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| But the idea that you reforest as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5751)|
| 1:35:53| And so if it's too restrictive, we ought to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| And I suppose in addition to asking plant scientists, we should ask hydrologists that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| Probably some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5763)|
| 1:36:04| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| Anybody have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| This is concerns section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5767)|
| 1:36:08| Councilman Thomas, you have a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Under what we said was supportive, we've said it allows a lot of environmental protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| but it does allow economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| But the concern is, is can that economic development be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5787)|
| 1:36:28| Can the development be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| I'm just, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5791)|
| 1:36:39| So you guys see the handwriting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| Don't you wish Phyllis was here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| You could read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| She's putting her kid in college in Oregon, so you got my handwriting instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| Anybody else have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| What are other concerns you have about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| It's just what I said earlier, that I think that, you know, it gets fuzzy when you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5812)|
| 1:36:59| every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| Some have already been cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| Others haven't at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| Where the development would fit versus, where the development or the developer would want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| versus where it's already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| Anyone else want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| So basically, does everybody kind of understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| You know, what we're looking at, do you have a good idea of what you're looking at up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| in terms of clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| And then come back and understand the supportive sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| As you know, it uses Mother Nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| It really does manage erosion and water in a way that's intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| It does a great job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| There are those who believe that allows for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| consistence with that kind of protection against erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| It gives them, and some would think, plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| They feel like others would say it also protects the downhill people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| I mean, that people are catching the brunt of that runoff and slides and water and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| It protects them, and it does all that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| On the other side, concerns are coming back to the councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| You know, how absolute should this number be, and is that too tight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| Do we need to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| I think it's Sevier County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| I think Sevier County's got a 30% type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| And can it be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| We claim that, but we really don't know if it can be done economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| And the concern that, you know, can you do this kind of strict numbering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5901)|
| 1:38:27| when properties differ, and how do we manage that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| Any other questions or comments you want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| before we kind of move on to other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| I just wanted to add to the support of the same thing that we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| in the previous discussion about density, and that is that these are proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| There's still an element of flexibility within these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| There is the judgment of the staffers and the experts in this field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5931)|
| 1:38:58| that are going to make decisions about where and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| And so I consider it still that an aspect of the supportive side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| is that it does have flexibility to look at these special landforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| which we acknowledge that in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| We have a varied topography, and the staff knows that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5956)|
| 1:39:22| and I think they've built that into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| So what I understand you saying, what I understand the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| you can come in and you can have these, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| If someone comes in, the MPC can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5971)|
| 1:39:34| They can make adjustments based upon proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| If they're unhappy with that, they can come back and they can appeal to their elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| about clearing as well as they can on slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| and you guys can change that or do whatever you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| But that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| So with that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=5995)|
| 1:40:08| let's talk about kind of the areas where there might be some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| Where are some areas that we could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6013)|
| 1:40:20| and maybe make some adjustment to this that might make it more useful in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6020)|
| 1:40:27| Can we go back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| I'll just go back to the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| Do you think that needs to be an area, the 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| where we might need to look at changing that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Is that what you think an area of flexibility would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| The 15% development at the 25, 40% level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| Again, I don't have the answers because I don't have the technical training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| and probably very few of us have the level of technical training in this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| or collection of bodies to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| But I have heard the argument made that if you list a long list of criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6055)|
| 1:41:04| that sort of end results you must reach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| but leave the flexibility to the designer to try to achieve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| you harness that kind of ingenuity and whatnot that we kind of treasure as Americans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| and when you make the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| come convince me in a planned zone that what you want to do is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| you take away from me the ability as a businessman to prepare a business plan on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6090)|
| 1:41:38| In other words, I've got to take a lot of risks if I'm a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| and I don't mean to stand here and talk only about developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| because I represent lots of people who are downhill and downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| and they're affected by floodwaters and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| But if you're a developer and you're making a business plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| you want to look at this and say, okay, there's so many acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| Bubba's going to sell it for X dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| I'm going to have to spend this kind of money on engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| on building it out, on loans and interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| and to the extent the criteria are in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| I can do my own math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I might be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| I might go belly up, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| But I can do my own math and figure out is this something I want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| If you force me in the alternative to buy it, plan it, engineer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6140)|
| 1:42:26| and then go see if I can make it work, I don't know if I want to take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| So you might be discouraging development because you discourage the kind of business assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6150)|
| 1:42:36| that someone would want to make, and that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Yeah, that really fits under concerns, but I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Okay, so that's more of a concern, but it's a very articulate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| So that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| You kind of need to put that one on that concern list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| And we're looking for what are some areas of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| Are there areas where there could be some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6173)|
| 1:42:55| areas that you'd like to see maybe some give and take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| Or is this plan exactly what you want, or it's so bad you can't deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6183)|
| 1:43:11| You know, it's not stated explicitly in the plan about some of the avenues of flexibility that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6191)|
| 1:43:21| You know, we've talked about this again and again, the right to appeal, you know, it's a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6201)|
| 1:43:25| and some of those things, and I don't know if that needs to be written explicitly in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6205)|
| 1:43:31| saying if you do not like this or if you feel you have this or there are exceptions, this may be appealed, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6211)|
| 1:43:39| And I think that that may, you know, that may leave some of the real heartburn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6219)|
| 1:43:47| and concerns that we're seeing from the different, you know, both the landowners over property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| and the developers over because so much of what we heard is that the law doesn't allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6234)|
| 1:44:00| It's not going to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| It's not going to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| And I think that was a lot of the misunderstanding that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| Some of it was true misunderstanding and some of it was intentional misinformation to, you know, to blur things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6246)|
| 1:44:14| But I think if we put something into the plan, it's to make it explicit, make it in black and white,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6254)|
| 1:44:21| and make it understandable about what the appeals process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| And so I hear what I hear Commissioner Briggs is saying, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| we need to pretty clearly state how that process works if you want flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| And there's an appeals process, the way you can go to do things differently or change the ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| and you may have a good idea of why you should develop more than 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6278)|
| 1:44:42| and there's a process you can go through to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| I hear over here on the concern side from the councilman is he has a concern that that type of percentages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6285)|
| 1:44:54| will keep people from being creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| But, you know, he doesn't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6296)|
| 1:45:00| A little further down the risk chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| A little further down the risk chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| Before you make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| You may have committed resources and dollars at that point rather than paper and ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Does anybody have anything else that you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| Is this about flexibility or areas you see some flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Oh, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| Everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| I know it's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| You're dropping like flies, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| I'm just losing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Is there anything else you want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| A little tag on what Nick said, which I thought was very, very well articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6327)|
| 1:45:37| What I guess maybe the end of that, though, is, again, because of my circumstances in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6337)|
| 1:45:47| obviously I'm concerned about the people downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| And what if you have a developer who's trying to do all this, and he thinks he's got a good plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6350)|
| 1:45:54| but he's wrong, and the people downtown suffer from his mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| no matter how well-intentioned he is or, you know, what resources he's brought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| So, I guess that's kind of, I understand completely Councilman Della Volpe's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6364)|
| 1:46:10| and it's a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6370)|
| 1:46:12| I guess that, I guess, is kind of the concern that kind of evolves out of his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6372)|
| 1:46:17| And so, what I hear you saying is, as we talk about flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| there has to be this balance between creativity and good management that you don't end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| And there's got to be that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| A couple more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6392)|
| 1:46:33| We'll kind of tie things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| I'll go to Commissioner Norm and Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| The same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| It's just extending upon what Charlie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| You know, what the specialists in the field know is that we have to consider not just a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6402)|
| 1:46:53| And stormwater managers have a much broader view of this topic of erosion and water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6413)|
| 1:47:00| And so, it's a watershed approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| And I sympathize with a businessman that has a parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| and he's trying to maximize his profit on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| But he has that parcel that lives and breathes within a watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| And so, as we try to accommodate the property rights of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6438)|
| 1:47:25| we've got to respond to the reality of what's going on in this much larger area in terms of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6445)|
| 1:47:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| That's almost what I said when we had our deliberations over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| One of the points that I made is that sometimes the biggest problems deals with codes, enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6461)|
| 1:47:48| and having penalties that are stiff enough when someone just ignores the law to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6468)|
| 1:47:54| And if you look up here to the people that are opposed to the plan, what they were saying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| they said just leave the current policies in place, but enforce the requirements and policies rather than develop new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6478)|
| 1:48:04| And so, I think even the people that are opposed to the plan recognizes that that's maybe what we need to do as much as anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6484)|
| 1:48:10| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| I feel like we've had a good discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| I hope you guys have seen some movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| What I hope to accomplish tonight was, first of all, clarity so that everybody, remember what I stated our goal was tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| Number one, to understand each other's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| Number two, have clarity about slope, clearing, and density, how that works, how that's involved, what the concerns are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6508)|
| 1:48:35| what supports are, and then look at some opportunities if we need to to build some flexibility in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6515)|
| 1:48:41| I feel like we got there tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| I hope you felt good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| I'll do a follow-up, and I will send you guys a summary of this discussion with the possible areas of flexibility that you may decide you want to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6524)|
| 1:48:52| and amend or not, and then we'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| Next time, kind of signposting at least our last meeting as far as I'm contracted to do, is we will discuss some other topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6535)|
| 1:49:04| We'll talk about, you guys will be ready in two weeks to address the legality of the document issue if you guys could do that for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| and you'll probably address it before then, but I know you will because you're just good, Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| That's all there is to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6556)|
| 1:49:17| And we'll also perhaps do the definition of ridgetop discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6557)|
| 1:49:21| If there's something else you feel like we need to talk about in that last meeting before we tie up the discussion, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6561)|
| 1:49:27| Did you get a list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Did you get any sticking points from something you mentioned that two weeks ago, submit sticking points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| I did, and it came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| I could send you the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6576)|
| 1:49:37| About half of you sent me stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| I sent you something, and I've got some more since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| And if you could send me more, these are the ones that jumped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| These are the sticking points that everybody almost mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Then there were a few others, definition of ridgetop and a few others, and I'll make sure that we talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6588)|
| 1:49:53| and some of those we may be able to bring up at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6597)|
| 1:49:58| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6598)|
| 1:49:59| I'm going to turn it back over to the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| I think we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110815hillsideridgetopprotection?start=6603)|
