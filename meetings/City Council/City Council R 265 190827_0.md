| 0:00:30| Okay, good evening. I'll call this meeting to order of Knoxville City Council on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=30)|
| 0:00:34| August 27, 2019. We will begin with an invocation that will be given by Councilman Roberto and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| the pledge will be led by Councilman Saunders. Vice Mayor Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=42)|
| 0:00:50| We gather today thankful for our democracy and the freedom our citizens enjoy in selecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| our community leaders. May your spirit encourage our civic engagement and grant us the strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| to overcome indifference. Please bless those who lift up our democracy and continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=61)|
| 0:01:05| protect the freedoms we enjoy with your grace. Grant us open minds and open hearts as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| take up the business of our city. Let us remember the needs of those who are lost and alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=71)|
| 0:01:15| so they feel comfort in the warmth of our community. May those who are hungry and thirsty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| find the nourishment they seek. We pray that our deliberations and decisions today will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=80)|
| 0:01:25| be worthy of your continued blessings. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=85)|
| 0:01:29| Please face the flag and render the salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| Please call the roll, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Councilman Campin. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=111)|
| 0:01:53| Councilman McKenzie. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=113)|
| 0:01:54| Councilman Ryder. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Councilman Roberto. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=115)|
| 0:01:56| Vice Mayor Saunders. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Councilman Singh. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Councilman Starr. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=119)|
| 0:02:00| Councilman Welch. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=120)|
| 0:02:01| Okay, we do have a quorum. Councilwoman Singh has requested that we move public forum up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=121)|
| 0:02:12| to early in the meeting. We have so many people here for public forum and I think we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| about eight people have signed up to speak. We'll have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=138)|
| 0:02:23| I have a statement I want to read and then we will invite each of those who wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| speak to the officer involved shooting to come up and address this council. Do you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| to make your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Yes, I'd like to make a motion to do public forum before we do the meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=154)|
| 0:02:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| Any opposed? That passes. First, I'd like to read a statement on the officer involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=161)|
| 0:02:50| shooting. We released it this afternoon. I want to address the officer involved shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| last night. First, let me say this is not what any of us in this community or in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| city want to hear about or experience or have to deal with. We are deeply saddened by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| Feep's death. Our heartfelt sympathies go out to his family and his friends. We know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| that an outcome like this is devastating to the community and to our Knoxville police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=192)|
| 0:03:17| officers. Our thoughts are with the officer who was injured last night as well. It is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=197)|
| 0:03:22| unfortunate that so much misinformation has been circulated about this tragic incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| I urge everyone to remain calm and withhold judgment until the investigation is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| and we are aware of all the facts. While I can't speak about the specifics of last night's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| shooting until the completion of the investigation, I do want to explain the process. By agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| among the Knox County Sheriff's Office, the Knoxville Police Department, and the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| County District Attorney General, any shooting involving a KPD officer is criminally investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| by the Knox County Sheriff's Office and vice versa. The intent is to remove any potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| of partiality or bias. Once the Sheriff's Office concludes its investigation, the findings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=245)|
| 0:04:12| will be presented to the DA, who will review the investigation and determine whether any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=252)|
| 0:04:18| criminal charges will be filed. The officer who was involved in last night's shooting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| will remain on administrative leave pending the DA's review. That is standard policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| Once the DA completes her review of the investigation, KPD's Internal Affairs Unit will conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=269)|
| 0:04:39| an additional investigation to determine whether the officer violated any departmental policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=279)|
| 0:04:45| Once that IAU investigation is concluded, its findings will be reviewed by the Citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=285)|
| 0:04:53| Police Advisory and Review Committee, or PARC. That's the process. I know we are all awaiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=293)|
| 0:05:01| the completion of these investigations, but please understand that gathering the facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| and getting to the truth takes time. I urge everyone to be patient. We do appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| you are all here, and I will just go in the order of the names that signed up. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| would come up to the podium. You can see above my head is a timer. We ask that you keep an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=317)|
| 0:05:23| eye on the time. Is it not up there? Oh, I don't have. Where's our screen? Sorry about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=323)|
| 0:05:30| that. It's in front of me. Can you make the screen go down? We will go ahead and begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=330)|
| 0:05:48| I will keep time myself and advise you when you're about one minute out so we can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| and get started while they try and get the screen fixed. This is the order in which the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=354)|
| 0:06:13| speakers will come up. Constance Every, Rick Roach, Noah Nordstrom, Denzel Grant, David Hayes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=373)|
| 0:06:26| Jane Crow, Sarah Jacques, and Abdullah Hussein. Okay. Miss Every, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=386)|
| 0:06:36| All right. 2018 to 2019, Sierra McCullen, 23, November, mental health, Jacob Morgan, 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=396)|
| 0:06:47| December, Jason Mnick, I'm sorry if I said his name wrong. I do apologize to the family, 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| January, and most recently, Tom Philly Phelps, 33. I have a question. It's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=413)|
| 0:07:01| I would like to know the police department's policy of training in de-escalation of force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| Because what we had take place was a matter of an encounter. The story that's been told by the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=428)|
| 0:07:17| reports of the newspaper and the news stations is that this police officer arrived to a scene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| that was an accident. In the process of this accident, supposedly a scuffle even encountered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| And then after the effects of the scuffle, we had a death, or what I would like to deem as murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| Murder took place. Because until we have all the facts, this looks like, smells like, talks and acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| like murder. And if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, guess what we got? A duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| So therefore, my next question comes down to, in that process of training, I find it disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| It takes longer to be a hairdresser than it does to be a police officer. So we have a problem already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| in that timeline of training as we speak. Additionally to the fact, let's keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| I just heard our mayor mention that the Knox County Police Department is going to be investigated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| by the Knox County Sheriff Department. Is there not a conflict of interest present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| That's like my brother validating for my brother. That's a problem. That's an in-house investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| That's not an internal investigation. We have a problem with that investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| Why is not the TBI that investigates the rest of the state when an in-police shooting happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| not investigating this case? Or better yet, why not have the FBI? Or here's my favorite one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| the Department of Justice. Why don't they come on down here and see what's going on around these parts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| We need to talk to them too. Additionally to the fact, we just spent $120,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| for the Knox County Fire Department to get bulletproof vests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| Can I get some national and local numbers on when a fire has ever shot a fire officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| I would love to know those numbers as well. Additionally to the fact, why didn't we spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| that $120,000 on body cameras? The one thing that we've just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| we are missing numerous facts, right? Guess what? If he was wearing a body camera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| I bet we would be missing no facts right now, now would we? We have a whole lot of facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| to go with what took place. But all we got is a he said, she said story. And guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| Y'all gonna ride with that blue badge and a heartbeat before we ever talk to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| who saw everything took place as well. Can we keep going? I'm not done just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| How about this part? Since 2015 to 2019, we have had four cadet classes, 80 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| How many of them were POC or minority? One, one, 80 people and one representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| of our community. That is a 0.0125% ratio of representation in our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| We have a problem there as well. When are you going to start hiring some of us that look like us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| that know how to deal with us? It's just like our kids in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=587)|
| 0:09:50| We need teachers that look like our kids to help teach our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| We don't need people how to relate to us being the police of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| That's a problem right now as we speak too. Can I keep going? Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| Park, is Mr. Vine present? I hope you open up an investigation on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| You better subpoena this case because you sure didn't subpoena Ciara McCullough's case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=606)|
| 0:10:10| that you should have been opened up and we should have been had some facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| She was a mental health patient, butt naked, cutting people, yet she lost her life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| in an account with the police too. Where is the justification for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=617)|
| 0:10:20| Additionally to the fact, y'all want to talk about black-on-black crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| Well, I'm going to remind you of something real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Black-on-black crime is poverty-driven. Poor people preying on poor people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| The difference, police officers are trained, paid professionals at their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| So we have a big problem when we talk about black-on-black and police-on-black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Big different conversation to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Additionally, I saw to the fact, did we not just watch a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| where we had a police officer demonstrate such culture of misconduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| because he got caught by his own in-house making inappropriate comments called a choke job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| Yet today, this is the same person that I know for a fact in the near future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| is going to cost us a whole lot of money in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| Chief Thomas, where is your accountability in your police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| and your ranks of leadership? We need some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| And listen up, tonight's election night, right now if you haven't vote, get up and go vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Because I'm asking the next mayor to take place to remove Chief Thomas, effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| She has shown failure time after time after time, and these factors will not be ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| They will not be overlooked. We need answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| Answer this child that's in this classroom right now about where her daddy is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Tell her where he happens to him. Tell her who's responsible for his death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| We need answers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| Mr. Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=702)|
| 0:12:07| You know me!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=727)|
| 0:12:16| Thank you, Mr. Roach. Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| Mr. Rick Roach, 244 Victoria Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| I don't want to be here. I really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| I really don't want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| I've been attending the last four party meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| I've queried Chief Thomas. I've queried Sergeant Watson, training officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=754)|
| 0:12:40| I've queried Assistant Chief Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| And we've had indicators that is going to bring about what we're here for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| We've had the indicators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Basically, no accountability. None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| At the end of the day, no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| And we need to start facing that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| I grew up in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=787)|
| 0:13:12| And, again, I didn't really have to worry about it when things got deep and nasty and confrontational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=792)|
| 0:13:23| Didn't have to worry about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Because we had a sense of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=806)|
| 0:13:30| So there was other avenues of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=810)|
| 0:13:34| So if we had a confrontation with the police, it could be resolved in a certain way within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=814)|
| 0:13:44| But in the 1980s, we saw a change happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| And y'all don't want to think about it or talk about it, but we had a change happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| I saw it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| I watched my community get denuded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=835)|
| 0:14:00| Literally abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Became a desert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| And some of those problems still persist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| And that's part of this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| So it's infiltrated all levels of authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| Most notably the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| The ones who have the most power at the point of contact within the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| You are authorized with enforcing the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=868)|
| 0:14:34| And yet, you cannot enforce yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| You cannot be accountable for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| Chief, I've asked you several times about the relationships between the sheriff's department and the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=885)|
| 0:14:53| About how you participate in particular programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=893)|
| 0:15:00| Whose responsibilities are, you know, what are your responsibilities within these relationships?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| And we get this generalized, oh, well, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| We have great relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| We do this, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| But it's nothing specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| It's nothing that says you people in this community have a right to know how we do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| And the other part of this is the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| I queried Chief Roush a couple of times about this, about the training that the police department receives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=930)|
| 0:15:37| And I was assured that, oh, it's the best training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| It's the best training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| We've talked about crisis intervention training over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| And not gotten sufficient answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| None that are sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Other than we have these requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| And literally, had it not been for public pressure, we might not have crisis intervention training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=953)|
| 0:16:02| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| It's something that, it's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| At the very least, it's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| The concept of community policing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| The concept of just maybe having four or five precincts throughout Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| to where an officer has a little bit of contact daily with the area that he polices or she polices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=983)|
| 0:16:34| Know who you're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| Know the people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Those concepts, those are simple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| And there are models out there right now where it is successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| Mayor, you know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| I know you talk about when you go to your mayor conferences and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| and these are some of the things you all talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1012)|
| 0:16:54| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I can't respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| But we know that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| So we have successful models out there, and it's not happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| But in conclusion, all I have to say is there has to be accountability, bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1024)|
| 0:17:10| And I'm not going to worry about calling for your resignation or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| because we don't know what we'll get if you do, if you have to resign or fire us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1040)|
| 0:17:30| Noah Nordstrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| Your name and address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Noah Nordstrom, 1623 Woodburn Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Police violence is an epidemic in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| Last night, police murdered Tom Philly Feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| He is their fourth victim in the last ten months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| Today, I'm raising my voice on behalf of Philly, Sierra McCauley, Jacob Morgan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| and Jason Minnick, who cannot be here today because they were murdered by the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1077)|
| 0:18:03| Police are an active threat to so many of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1083)|
| 0:18:11| Since its inception as slave catching, policing has served to kill, brutalize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| and enslave black people in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1097)|
| 0:18:27| Now, with 287G in place at our county jail, police, and listen to this, including KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1107)|
| 0:18:35| and the Knox County Sheriff's Office are increasingly targeting our undocumented neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1115)|
| 0:18:41| Families are being destroyed, lives are being ruined, families are being separated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| and people are being funneled into federal concentration camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1126)|
| 0:18:55| Not only has policing targeted black and undocumented communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| but they are also an active threat to the safety and well-being of homeless folks in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1138)|
| 0:19:09| When this city council decided to kick the homeless people out from under the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| police ransacked their belongings and displaced the most vulnerable members of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| That is despicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Rather than demanding accountability, the city, and specifically you Mayor Rojero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| appointed Eve Thomas, Chief of Police, knowing full well that she was involved in covering up police violence against homeless people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1170)|
| 0:19:44| To make matters worse, y'all voted nearly unanimously just a few weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| to put a new police headquarters in the shuttered St. Mary's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| Right in the middle of a working class neighborhood with a sizable black and undocumented population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| That's terrorizing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| And as y'all can probably tell, we've had quite enough of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| We demand a full city run investigation into the killing of Philly Tom Feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| We demand an immediate halt to the progress on this new police headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| until you let the community decide what we want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| We demand that you disinvest in policing and you make major investments into our communities instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1232)|
| 0:20:43| And we demand more resources and teeth for PARC, the organization to hold police accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1243)|
| 0:20:51| And last point, to anyone in this room who has not voted in today's city council primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| vote for Amelia Parker, David Hayes, and Charles Albaoui,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| because the stakes are too high to accept the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| People are literally dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1267)|
| 0:21:22| Is Mr. Grant here, Denzel Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1282)|
| 0:21:38| Sir, thank you for being here. Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| Denzel Grant, 2425 Hoyt Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| Before I get to hit my key points today, I just want you guys, the part that you guys don't get to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1306)|
| 0:21:56| This is Philly's Mr. Feet. This is the mother of his daughter here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| This is Bella. I got to meet Bella yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| It's challenging. I don't know if there's really any words that I could say when it comes to the stuff as a community that we have to endure that you guys don't get to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1329)|
| 0:22:24| This beautiful young girl here, she just lost her father yesterday to murder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| Her father was murdered yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| When you have police officers who abuse citizens, you erode the public confidence when it comes to law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1355)|
| 0:22:45| That makes the job of good police officers I know difficult, but it also adds mistrust to the community when it comes to trusting law enforcement as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1365)|
| 0:22:58| When that officer pulled him over, he didn't see a man with hopes. He didn't see a man with dreams or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1378)|
| 0:23:07| He didn't see a man with disappointments. He didn't see a man with accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| He saw a brown-skinned individual. That's all he seen was a brown-skinned individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1392)|
| 0:23:26| I know it's hard to believe that when you look for safety and security, those people that we look to for that are actually the ones that are causing us harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1406)|
| 0:23:41| I'm not delusional or whatever. I'm not lying or anything when I say that I'm scared of law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1421)|
| 0:23:51| I'm scared of law enforcement. When I get pulled over, when I drive past a police officer, I'm afraid because of my skin color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| That, to me, is a very, very major issue that we have, not just in Knoxville but in our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| It starts with our leadership. It starts with our leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| Chief Thomas, I've tried. I've tried. I've come to park meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1458)|
| 0:24:26| I've tried reaching out through Mr. Vaughn in the park and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| Normally, within the workforce, if a person isn't performing their duties, they're let go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| It should be the same exact thing when it comes to KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| You aren't doing your job. You are not doing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| Law enforcement, if you're not doing your job, you have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Chief Thomas, you have to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1492)|
| 0:24:55| You're not giving us any sense of accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1495)|
| 0:25:05| There's been a number of incidents leading up to this incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| This unfortunate incident, and it shouldn't have took this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| It shouldn't have got this far, but unfortunately, it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| You know what plays a part in that? Accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Officers not being held accountable to their actions, so they feel like they can go out here and they can do whatever it is that they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| This daughter, not only is this his biological daughter, but Philly, he actually had two other kids that he raised as well that also called him father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1523)|
| 0:25:35| They watched on the balcony as their father laid in the cold rain for three hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| They watched their father lay in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| I drove over there earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| You could see the silhouette of his body from the ground being saw from the rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| You can still see that silhouette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| Something has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| It's time for you guys to set something in place to where the community members can let us choose what we want to do with our dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1561)|
| 0:26:08| This excuse of you guys not having enough funding for body cams, it's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| It's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| It's ridiculous when you're putting millions of dollars into another facility, but you can't invest a million dollars, not only to protect us, but also to make the law enforcement job easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1576)|
| 0:26:27| It's a two-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Something has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| I'm with Ms. Every.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| It's time for Chief to be replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| We have a new election coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I encourage everybody, please go vote, because if you guys aren't doing anything, it's time to clean house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1598)|
| 0:26:59| No peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1619)|
| 0:27:12| David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| All right, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1634)|
| 0:27:26| I'll be on this stage soon, so I figured I'd walk across it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1646)|
| 0:27:36| My name is David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Can I have a restart of this time, those 10 seconds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| I haven't said my address yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Restart is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| My name is David Hayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| My address is 1312 Hawthorne Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| So last night I was talking to voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| I was talking to people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| It was a great day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| It was a great day of being out and talking to folks and getting folks to vote and getting folks to get politically active and getting folks to see that we need to build political power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| And it was such a good day, but then I got this text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| I started getting these messages on my phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| I started getting tagged and mentioned, and I saw a picture of a still body in the ground, the wet, cold ground that was there for hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1696)|
| 0:28:33| I don't want to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I don't want to be right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| I'd rather not have to run for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| I wish that we had a city government that took care of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1719)|
| 0:28:52| But unfortunately, time and time again, we see that that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| We see that Knoxville is not working for all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| So this is something my campaign had to say about this incident and what we should do about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| Last night, a Knoxville police officer shot and killed a person of color in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1749)|
| 0:29:15| This is at least four people killed by KPD in the last 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| I just heard of another incident this weekend where somebody lost their life with a running police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1760)|
| 0:29:27| So we call on the city of Knoxville to release all the dash cam footage to appoint an independent investigator over this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1767)|
| 0:29:37| Independent, because we all know about the sheriffs, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| A lot of things have been going on with KPD, but we all know about the sheriffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| Having the sheriffs police the police? Come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| So we need an independent investigator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| And we need to expand the powers and resources of the police advisory review committee called PARC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1796)|
| 0:30:09| When officers kill members of the community, they should be investigated by independent authorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1809)|
| 0:30:17| not the colleagues in the KPD or the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| And the community deserves to know what happened to the slain Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| A Knoxvillian, somebody who y'all are supposed to protect, somebody whose interests you're supposed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1826)|
| 0:30:34| The community deserves oversight of the police with the power to discipline officers who cause harm in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1834)|
| 0:30:43| to update police policies and procedures, including the use of force policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| and to affect the police budget if necessary. And it's looking like it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1851)|
| 0:31:03| The community deserves a Knoxville where all Knoxvillians are safe from all forms of violence and harm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| That is the Knoxville that so many of us voted for today. I appreciate y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1871)|
| 0:31:29| Jane Crow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Please state your name and address for the record. Thank you for being here, Jane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you. My name is Jane Crow. I live at 428 East Springdale Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| And I appreciate you letting me speak this evening. First of all, I want to say his name, Tom Philly Feep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1903)|
| 0:31:51| I just met his daughter. I just looked into her eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| And I am so devastated that she's going to have to grow up without a father because we don't have adequate training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| and we're not allocating the funding that we need to train these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| I'm a social worker, a proud social worker in this community, and I work with the homeless every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1926)|
| 0:32:13| And I live in the community where the new headquarters are going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| What I want to see is affordable housing. What I want to see is mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| We have lost 300 people to drug overdoses in our community last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| Where are the treatment beds? I can't get my clients in treatment. I can't get my clients in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Where are the resources? Why are we wasting resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| I don't know. Firefighters, maybe they face bullets. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| But there's no price on human life. There's no price on human life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| I don't care if we have to spend a hundred million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| There's no price on this man's life and the other people that have been killed unjustly by the police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| Unarmed? Unarmed? On the ground. Unarmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| And it breaks my heart for this family and this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| And why don't we have social workers with the police going out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| Where's the mental health professionals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| You cannot expect all the officers to be mental health professionals and counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| But we've got a lot of counselors in this community. I'm one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| I'll ride with the police. I'll talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| We've got a lot of people that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| And I've been in this community since 1984, and the institutionalized racism in this community is rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| Rampant. Rampant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| And it ends here. You know who it ends with is these young people behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| The people of color who I am following. I'm an old white lady, but I'm following them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| I'm following them. I'm taking their lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| And it takes a lot of courage for me to get up here because of who I am in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2036)|
| 0:34:01| But I am not going to sit on the sidelines and watch people in my community be killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| I will not. I will not stand for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| And we're going to come together, old and young and black and white and Cambodian and undocumented and documented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| and gay and straight and queer and transgender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| And we're going to change this town, and you're going to see it unfold before your very eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| This is just the beginning of a whole new Knoxville, and I'm so proud of these folks behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2065)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2072)|
| 0:34:47| Thank you for being here. Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| My name is Sarah Jacques, and I'm at 934 Banks Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| And it's actually interesting right back to back because I'm also a social worker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| and we live in the same neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| And I am also disgusted at the amount of money that's being spent on a new police facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2105)|
| 0:35:10| and when we can't manage to get body cams for our officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| That's not what I came up here to talk to you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| because I would not presume to speak for the community of people of color in our neighborhoods and our streets that are suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| because I don't know they're suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| But what I will talk about to you white people that are sitting up here on this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| is the way that your husbands, your brothers, your sons do not need to fear when police pull them over at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2133)|
| 0:35:45| I will tell you about officer-involved shootings being the sixth leading cause of death for people of color,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| men of color specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| I will tell you about the young gentlemen of color that I have fostered through the foster care system in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2154)|
| 0:36:01| who I've had to warn about keeping their hands on the steering wheel when an officer pulls them over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| about not running, about not walking with their hoods up, about not being in certain parts of town after dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| about the fear I worry about if they get pulled over and they see that they're a foster kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| We don't have to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| I don't worry about my husband getting pulled over after work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| He's a social worker. He's in rough parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| If they're out looking for somebody, I'm not worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| I'm not worried about any future children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| And you don't have to worry about that if you have white kids, white brothers, white fathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| But you know what? This community does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| The sixth leading cause of death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| So here's what you have to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| You either have to admit that we have a police problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2209)|
| 0:37:00| There you go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| I'm terrible at public speaking and I want you to know, like, you can see my hands are shaking right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| It's going very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| But this matters enough to me that I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Because you know what, white people? We got a job to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| We need to be standing behind our communities, our people of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| We need to be letting their voices be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| You're all stories, a story that matters, but white people, we need to be calling each other out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| Y'all white people up here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Y'all are not suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| This isn't a priority for you because it doesn't affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| This isn't a priority for you because it doesn't affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| 28-7G is not a priority for you because it doesn't affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2271)|

| 0:38:00| Homelessness is not a priority for you because it does not directly affect you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| And until you start making other people's problems and compassion a priority, nothing is going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2285)|
| 0:38:15| So the next time your children, your brothers, your husbands go out in their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2295)|
| 0:38:22| I want you to imagine them sitting there, maybe being pulled over, terrified if they move those hands off the wheel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2302)|
| 0:38:29| if those hands aren't completely visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| That as soon as that window goes down, if they step outside that vehicle, they're getting shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2316)|
| 0:38:48| Abdullah Hussain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you for being here. Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| My name is Abdullah Hussain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| My address is 2421 South Side Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| I was born and raised in Knoxville. I've lived here my entire life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| I'm an Eagle Scout from Troop 255, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| I said hi to these guys earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| I've served as a student member for the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2354)|
| 0:39:18| I sat right there in that chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Sorry, David Hayes, I beat you to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| As a member of this community, and as a white-passing member of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| it's my duty and my responsibility to stand against injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| Interestingly enough, I work at a behavioral health hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| I work in mental health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| And in order to get a part-time job at the hospital as a counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| we're required to go through two weeks of training on de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2386)|
| 0:39:54| And it's interesting to me that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| it seems like perhaps the part-time employees of a local behavioral health hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2399)|
| 0:40:07| get better de-escalation training than maybe some KPD officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2407)|
| 0:40:13| On the City of Knoxville's website, the KPD's mission statement says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| that the Knoxville Police Department shall strive for excellence in performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| and delivery of all services to the total community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2422)|
| 0:40:26| We will recruit, employ, and maintain personnel who reflect high professional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| We will be committed to providing the best possible service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| We will recruit, employ, and maintain personnel who reflect high professional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| Knowing that law enforcement officers are held to a higher standard of conduct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| the officers of the Knoxville Police Department shall strive to uphold the highest ethical ideals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| in both their professional and private lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| We shall take an active role in establishing and maintaining a professional image of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| and all our contact to the public we serve through honesty and integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| This morning when I saw the headline on the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| that Knox County authorities ID a man killed in KPD officer-involved shooting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| I knew without having to do any research that it was a black man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| And I think that says something about the nature of our justice system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| and the people responsible for our justice here in the U.S. and in Knoxville specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| And as each of you stand up and promise to do your duties and take your oaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| to protect us all in this city and to serve us as best you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| and you pledge allegiance to the flag claiming to uphold liberty and justice for all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| I humbly ask you as a member of this community to stand for that justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| that you talk about time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| And so what we need is justice and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| And we will be here time and time again and over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| and I will come here every week, and we will come here every week if we have to for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2529)|
| 0:42:30| I want to thank you all for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| I want to thank those who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| We have heard you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| We will reflect on what you have said and the challenges you have presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| For now, we will also await the investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| As I outlined it, that is the process we will follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| and we will be reporting back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2578)|

| 0:43:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Merritt would like to propose a motion to be added by emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2639)|

| 0:44:11| and donating to the Alliance House Coalition on behalf of African American| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2651)|

| 0:44:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| So this is a vote to add that to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| So then we will actually vote on the item when we get to that on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2672)|
| 0:44:36| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=2676)|

| 0:52:46| Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| I'd like to make a statement and also to ask representatives from the Alliance House that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3167)|
| 0:52:54| are the sponsors and founders of this African American Women's Breast Cancer Awareness Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3174)|

| 0:53:07| with breast cancer in the African American female community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3187)|

| 0:53:18| so that we know that you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3198)|
| 0:53:20| And I also want to let council know that part of these activities will also celebrate 16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3200)|

| 0:53:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Please state your name and address to get started, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| DRC Dion Dingus, 4224 Angola Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3216)|
| 0:53:42| I'm the Executive Director of the Alliance House Community Coalition and have been so since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3222)|
| 0:53:52| We've done a lot of stuff in the community, from toy drives to building gardens to providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3232)|
| 0:54:01| clothes and insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| But last year I came across a young lady that was suffering from breast cancer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| And she was 30 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| And she had contracted this disease when she was 25, and in that five-year span, in five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3252)|
| 0:54:19| between 25 and 30, she had lost her mother to the disease, her aunt to the disease, and her cousin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| to the disease while she was going through reconstructive surgery herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| And so I began to think that maybe I wasn't using my bully poor pit in the right way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| something I was missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| And so I began looking at the disparities between white women and black women throughout the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3281)|
| 0:54:49| and in state as related to the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3289)|
| 0:54:54| Forty percent of African American women will die from breast cancer throughout the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3294)|
| 0:55:00| Forty percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| Sixty percent in state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| And we're not the worst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| California is 73%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| And so when I began asking the question about what programs are there for black women in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3309)|
| 0:55:18| the answer is none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| There's none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| And so dealing with black women and breast cancer is a unique thing to black women themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3321)|
| 0:55:28| And so we decided last year to put on an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| And we gained traction from it, and we were very successful in doing it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3333)|
| 0:55:40| This year we've received a proclamation from the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| and we received a proclamation as early as last Thursday from Glenn Jacobs' office in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3344)|
| 0:55:53| So we're doing the work in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| And I urge the city to jump on board to do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| and to promote education and outreach for black women who are suffering from this disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3359)|
| 0:56:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3368)|
| 0:56:17| We already have a motion, but I wanted to be the one to do that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| I hesitated a little too long, so I think we're ready for the vote now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| I want to thank you all for being here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| and thank you for the work that you're doing at the Alliance House for this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3393)|
| 0:56:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| We could probably make that as a motion from Gwen, from Councilwoman McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| Thank you, Councilwoman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you for your support of it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| 11B is a resolution respectfully requesting the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| to consider and make a recommendation to city council regarding limited revisions to the city sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| So we have two people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| Do you want to hear from them first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3424)|
| 0:57:05| Sure, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3425)|
| 0:57:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| First we have to speak against this is Joyce Feld, and then Carleen Malone is here to speak for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3427)|
| 0:57:19| If I read these right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| So Ms. Feld will let you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| I'm Joyce Feld, 1540 Ogilwilla Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| It's not really accurate to say I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| It's just when you call up to speak, they say pigeon-hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| They make you choose one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3455)|
| 0:57:37| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| I'm looking at a letter that went out to members of city council from Christina McGraws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3461)|
| 0:57:52| and it has more issues on it than the ones on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| Are those also going to be considered under this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| There's something about office signs as well as institutional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3480)|
| 0:58:08| Well, I'll just say what I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| So office signs, and I'll be brief because I know everybody wants to get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| So office 01 zoning is a buffer zone, and it's frequently adjacent to residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| And recently, if you recall a few months ago, Scenic Knoxville successfully appealed a decision by the BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| to allow larger signs for a new Hilton Hotel on Pratt Road that stood next to and across from small homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| and they weren't even asking for commercial-sized signs, yet city council sided with Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3516)|
| 0:58:42| that they should be restricted to signs for the office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| So office zoning standards were discussed at length during the sign task force and by city council in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| and our feeling is that commercial signage isn't appropriate in an office zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| In terms of abandoned signs, Scenic, I don't have a problem with a 60-day notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| to allow the owner to correct the situation if the owner is able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| but Scenic Knoxville has long been concerned with some issues regarding abandoned signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3551)|
| 0:59:16| and especially non-conforming signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| They can be blank or unused for years, but as long as the property owner says that the property is being marketed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| the signs can remain, and respectfully, we ask the planning staff and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3566)|
| 0:59:32| to investigate whether language can be inserted into the ordinance to declare these signs abandoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| and to allow for the removal of these signs in these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| An example is the old Howard Johnson's Hotel across from West Town Mall, which was vacant for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| and where several non-conforming signs stood, but because the property was being marketed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3588)|
| 0:59:54| they could not be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| Doing this levels the playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| The hope is that ultimately the whole city is in conformity with the 2015 sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3599)|
| 1:00:08| Mansard roofs, we're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| It's just that language needs to be included as to the size of the signs that's commensurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3613)|
| 1:00:21| with the existing language for wall signs or touch signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| and also it has to be made clear that the signs cannot be on top of the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| Signs in institutional zones, we're all in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| These standards need to be developed because they weren't fleshed out in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| The last one is additional signs to be approved in certain zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| and under recode the planning commission is allowed to approve additional signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| and our feeling is that this should undergo a request for variance through the BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you, Ms. Fell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you, Carlene Malone, 6051 Fountain Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| I am in favor of the resolution as it is presently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| with three very specific items to be addressed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3678)|
| 1:01:27| I'm not in favor of adding additional things to this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3687)|
| 1:01:31| in part because the agenda item, the resolution in your packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| and as we view it as residents and citizens of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| gives public notice to what's being discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| and the whole sign ordinance was not opened by this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| which says very clearly that it is a limited review of three specific things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3709)|
| 1:01:56| and I support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| The items that Ms. Fell just discussed came out of an August 16th email from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3718)|
| 1:02:11| and I think many of us, certainly I, have problems with what's in that memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| and I would ask that none of that be put on tonight's agenda or be included in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| The item I have a problem with that Ms. Fell did not totally address is in Article 13.9F.5.e,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3745)|
| 1:02:37| and that has to do with adding additional signs in commercial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3757)|
| 1:02:44| That same provision exists in our present sign ordinance with one massive difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3764)|
| 1:02:53| and that difference is that our present sign ordinance is very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| that MPC can add additional signs only to planned zones, planned commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| PC1, PC2, Shopping Center 1, Shopping Center 2, Shopping Center 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| As you know, those zones do not appear in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| They have been deleted, and what was seemingly mechanically replaced for the planned zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3794)|
| 1:03:22| are the non-planned zones of general commercial, you know, GC, GH, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| Council, as you know, the big difference between a planned zone and non-planned zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| is a public hearing and a development plan which allows the community to attend an MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3814)|
| 1:03:43| and appeal the decision of that meeting to council if they see fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3823)|
| 1:03:50| to consider everything about the planned development from the arrangement of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3830)|
| 1:03:57| to the exterior materials to the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3837)|
| 1:04:04| That is not, that public process, that use on review development plan in a planned zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3844)|
| 1:04:11| is not part of general commercial, you know, CG, CH, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| So when you get rid of the planned process, the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| when you get rid of the public involvement and just substitute zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3862)|
| 1:04:28| and allow MPC without, seemingly without a process and seemingly with no context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| to allow additional signs, I think one needs to look at using the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| that all other zones use in order to allow an additional sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| and as Ms. Felt said, that is BZA in the variance process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| not some made-up process that allows MPC to do it with no context, no public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| And furthermore, we would ask that both the institution changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| and the planned commercial and so on changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| This section that allows additional signs, that they both be treated the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| If both are going, if one's going to the stakeholders committee, both should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| Both of these items are equally urgent and need to be fixed prior to the effective date of recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3921)|
| 1:05:29| They're both flawed and they're flawed for the same reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| Either zones were deleted or zones were added without adequate management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3932)|
| 1:05:39| of the signs in those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| So, again, I appreciate what Councilman Wallace is doing this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| and I support it and ask that nothing be added to it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| Thank you, ma'am. Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| So when we passed the sign ordinance in 2015, it was after two and a half years of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3953)|
| 1:06:00| we met every other week for an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Duane Grieve and I co-chaired that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| We made a pledge in 2015 that we would address any reoccurring issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| and come back and look at those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| I've met with Peter Ahrens and Gerald Green and people in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3971)|
| 1:06:17| and the three items that came up the most were these, the signs on mantard roofs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| not gabled roofs, not sloped roofs, as you might say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3983)|
| 1:06:31| mantard roofs in this particular style that we come into contact with a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| The timeframe to address and determine abandoned signs, we're looking for a cure period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| Right now, if a sign is deemed to be abandoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| the owner receives a notice to correct it and remove it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| and he's given really no time to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| So we're looking for ample time to correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| And then the third thing is the structure that that sign is in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| So many of these large signs have a large concrete footer that's underground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| real expense of taking that out, and we're asking for it to be left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| The other items that are mentioned in the memo from the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| I think will be deferred to the advisory council on down the line and look at other changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4037)|
| 1:07:25| So really just the three, just intentionally left it really specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4045)|
| 1:07:30| in hopes that we wouldn't open up the whole thing or add things to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4050)|
| 1:07:35| So with that, hopefully you all support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| We'll send this to MPC for not explaining, and then they will make their recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4058)|
| 1:07:44| and then bring it back to us for a vote at a later time, hopefully before the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| I just wanted to let Ms. Feldknecht and Ms. Malone know that I'm working on the institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| and on the additional signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| I've been in contact with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| and my understanding is that work is being done on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| Those will be brought up in a separate amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| So you can look forward to seeing that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4100)|
| 1:08:21| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4105)|
| 1:08:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| to provide an amount not to exceed $52,684 in community development block grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4115)|
| 1:08:42| for the conceptual design and technical assistance for community improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| Our former vice mayor and the director now of the East Tennessee Community Design Center is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| and I'd like to ask him to say a few words, but not about the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4134)|
| 1:09:00| I was just going to say, Mayor, this was like deja vu, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| George, what's going on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Duane Greve, Executive Director of the East Tennessee Community Design Center, 1300 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4145)|
| 1:09:10| I just want to say, first of all, I want to thank council personally for your 202 funds this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| We were able to upgrade all our computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| I also want you to know that I went back and checked from the funds that the city has been giving the design center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4158)|
| 1:09:27| the CDBG and the COK funds, and I only went back to 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| And with those funds, we have provided services for 325 projects during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4174)|
| 1:09:42| And with this, it's also interesting to note that the money that you allocate to us tonight is that we have to have in-kind services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4182)|
| 1:09:51| So we have volunteers, volunteers who have worked with the design center since the early 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| And, Mayor, you're one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| Not the 70s and the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| In the 90s, not the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| So, anyway, $26,000 will be in-kind services that will be provided by volunteers for this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| And next year, I just want to put a plug in the fact that the design center will be 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| And I've looked back, and during those 50 years, by next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| the design center will have provided architectural, planning services, landscape services to other nonprofits to the tune of almost 1,100 projects by that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4226)|
| 1:10:36| And that takes a lot of volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| It takes a lot of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| And we're real pleased with the work that we've done, and we look forward to moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| I've given each of you a book that shows the design center's work that we do in 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| We not only do Knoxville and Knox County, but we serve 16 counties in the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4252)|
| 1:10:57| We've picked several projects as examples for those, and so we hope that you'll take that and take a good look at it and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| I've also included a save-the-date invitation to our gala on October 18th and hope that you folks will be able to attend on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4265)|
| 1:11:13| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Isn't that October 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| You said 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Did I say 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I meant 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| So, both days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| The design center really does have a tremendous history of good work, so we're pleased to continue to support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4296)|

| 1:12:17| And thank you for voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4337)|

| 1:12:36| Knox Works as a program has been around for about seven or eight years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| Trying to address a particular need in the community, we identified that we found that there were about 4,300 young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4360)|
| 1:12:49| 16 to 24 years old, on any given day that are not in school and are not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| And a large proportion of this population that we identified as we began to get into it had a lot of issues of mental health issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| substance abuse issues, and all kinds of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| So Knox Works is a program that's all about getting a young person a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4387)|
| 1:13:11| So it's an employment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| But we realize that there are a lot of barriers and a lot of resources and tools that these individuals need to get to that place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| and sustain a living wage, a good job that will allow them to continue on and develop a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4401)|
| 1:13:31| These aren't jobs at McDonald's, and this is more about trying to help them develop credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| We're getting kids high set, getting them back in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| Through our program, we have an actual high set program as a part of Knox Works to help them get an education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| We're doing construction credentialing, CNA credentialing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| all kinds of different types of programs that we're allowing them to get credentials in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| so that when they go to get a job, they actually have a certificate that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| I know something about what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| And you follow them once you find them employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| We have a follow-up period of about a year after that, and case managers that manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4445)|
| 1:14:09| So it's a heavy lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| This is a tough population to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| We found, just as a story, and I'll close after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| is that we also manage the Flinagan Landing facility out in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| And that population out there roughly is around 45 to 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| These are people that have been on the street for more than, some of them, 15, 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4465)|
| 1:14:30| Homeless, chronically homeless individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| And as we've gotten to know those people that live at Flinagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| their stories are just layered with trauma, abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| all kinds of different substance problems and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| It's a life of just, they've added up, and they're out there on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| and they've lived there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| I had some social workers that came back after interviewing them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| and shared some of the stories and the back stories that they learned from those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| And I'd just come out of a meeting with some kids that were working in Knox Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| and all of these young people had the same exact story growing up that Flinagan did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| So we realized if we don't do this work with Knox Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| what we're doing is we're preparing these kids for Flinagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| So this is a way to get out in front of having a chronically homeless population in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| So we're excited about the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| We're very grateful for our partnership with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| You guys have been a very great partner for Knoxville Leadership Foundation over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| and we're very appreciative for the money, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Yeah, no, I think it's a tremendous program, and we're talking about helping people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| and these are some of our young people that are really at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| And I like it that you follow them after you find them employment, and it's not just a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| It's a career that ideally they can take care of themselves and their family and have a good life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4545)|
| 1:15:52| So I think it's a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| We've got a lot of challenges that we've talked about in this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| and I think it's good to highlight this program that is moving the needle with individuals at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4557)|
| 1:16:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| We have a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Our staff is just amazing that day in and day out build relationships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| Andrew Church is here, our assistant director of Knox Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| and they are lifting some heavy tasks over there every day with these young people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4573)|
| 1:16:18| but they do it because they care, and the relationships that they're building there are strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| And so thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| I was just going to add to the compliments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| When I was associated with an electrical contracting company, we had hired some people from Knox Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| and they were some of the best employees, and when there were problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| you guys followed up and helped them get through them, and they're doing well today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| We have some young people that come to work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| and I had one of my staff call back one day and he sent a picture of a bunch of these folks out on a job site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| trying to spread hay out over to grass on a yard that we had built, a house we had built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| and they were holding their pants up with one hand and throwing straw with the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4620)|
| 1:17:05| and he called me back and sent me a picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| He said, I just increased productivity by 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| He'd taken the string off the bales of hay and tied their pants up, and now they were using two hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| Part of it is just really teaching some young folks how to keep their pants up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| how to show up for work, and how to stay drug free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| If we can do that, we're making a lot of headway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| Sir, don't run away. Come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Mr. Martin, we're going to make you stand for two more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| I just wanted a little bit more detail about how folks are identified for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| There are a number of different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| When we first started working with this population, it was difficult just because there are a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| unfortunately, there are a lot of sectors of our city that don't want you to know about these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| especially in the education and school systems, those kind of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| They're pushing strong graduation rates, but they're kids that are falling off the wagon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4683)|
| 1:18:10| So we had to go find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Part of that was developing a relationship with school counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4692)|
| 1:18:15| That's one spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| We've also worked a lot with juvenile court and adult court, the probation officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| Then it's just now that we've been doing this for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| it's spread of all these kids have friends that are just like them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| and so those kids are telling each other about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| So we get them in the room, so they show up and apply, and they don't get in automatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4715)|
| 1:18:44| We have to really see that they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| And so we have a process that we take them through to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| But we're having more and more young folks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| We've got, I don't know, Andrew, about 100 or something over the last year or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| Any given day in our facility over on Baxter Avenue, we have, or Elm Street, I guess you'd say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4737)|
| 1:19:04| we have any 30 to 40 kids in there every day in class and doing high set, employability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| learning construction trades, skills like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| And we have cohorts that we run through like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4754)|
| 1:19:17| But identification of the young folks is pretty difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| We've just received some other funding thanks to the leverage of the city money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| We've got two federal grants from the Department of Labor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| One's called Youth Build that we've been doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| and that mainly focuses on construction but some other credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| And then we've just been awarded a new funding source through the Department of Labor for prison reentry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4775)|
| 1:19:42| So we'll be working with, and we've got a partnership with Focus Prison Ministry that's inside the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| We're beginning to work with young people that are there that they've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| So we'll be having a track coming out of some prisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| But anyway, so it's a very, you know, it's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| There are not a lot of people working with this population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| And that's what our organization has done over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| We've tried to identify the gaps and lean into those and find ways that we can address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| And so my good friend Steve Diggs at Emerald Youth Foundation wants us to do this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| because we're not competing with anybody because these are young people that don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| They may have been in those programs earlier when they were little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| but as they get into teenage years and 18 and 19 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| they're falling off the wagon and they're basically off the grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| And so we've got to go find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4835)|
| 1:20:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| I think that's all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| Sorry to take so much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4841)|

| 1:20:47| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to amend contract number C-15-0199| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4848)|

| 1:21:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4875)|
| 1:21:16| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| 11F is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| State of Tennessee Department of Transportation to construct a new shared use path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| connecting First Creek Greenway to the Knoxville Botanical Gardens and Arboretum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| for an estimated project cost of $1,700,000 with the city funding $340,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4889)|
| 1:21:36| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| We have Mr. Rick Roach who would like to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Thank you for sticking around for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| And please state your name and address again for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Mr. Rick Roach, 2404 Victoria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| I just wanted to get some clarification on the beginnings and the endings of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4907)|
| 1:21:54| I know the money from the state is pretty much in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| Would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Do you want to speak to the timing on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| This is just the very first step, correct, Mr. Hagerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| Yes, this is just the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| We have the – this is a contract with the state to secure the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4930)|
| 1:22:18| After this happens, we go out and hire a consultant to do the design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4938)|
| 1:22:24| There will be right-of-way work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| There will be environmental work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4945)|
| 1:22:27| So it will probably be a couple of years or something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4947)|
| 1:22:31| before we actually get to construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| Before the rubber hits the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Then I signed on as being in favor, and I am in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| I had put forward this idea probably 10 years ago dealing with the Williams Creek situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4966)|
| 1:22:47| One of the four pinpoints that we had when we had the then so-called Williams Creek Consortium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| we said this is one of the things we wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| One of those primary things was the urban forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4978)|
| 1:23:03| What I'd really like to see emphasized on this project would be to start in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4983)|
| 1:23:11| and have maybe the design element include at least two spurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| one of those spurs being along Williams Creek itself, down to the river if possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| connecting in that area around Riverside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| and also to be considered connecting that into the urban forest area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| We had already given some design information about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| not necessarily hard trails, single-use soft trails, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| So the city has acquired that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| It's an urban forest-designated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| It's had some attention in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| It's a vital area of reinvigorating the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| I would love to see that element included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Please try your best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| I'm available if you want to bring me in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5047)|
| 1:24:11| We can get some other people in on this to give you some advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5051)|
| 1:24:15| on how to make it really useful for the community as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5055)|
| 1:24:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5060)|
| 1:24:21| You have done tremendous work dealing with Williams Creek over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| Both Mr. Hagerman, Mr. Hester, who's back there, our parks and greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| there will be plenty of opportunities for input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| Make sure you all reach out to him since he knows the ground probably better than anybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| Like you said, this is very early in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| but it's a pretty important piece of the process because it secures the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| that allows us to move on to the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5092)|

| 1:25:47| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5148)|

| 1:26:00| for the Fort Kidd Revitalization Project for an amount sought to exceed $29,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5160)|
| 1:26:08| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5171)|
| 1:26:12| Mr. Brace, just a couple questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5172)|
| 1:26:20| I know you and I have talked about this several different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5180)|
| 1:26:23| but can you maybe go over with us a little bit the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| I know you had some engineers check out the condition of the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5186)|
| 1:26:30| and the structure itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| Can you maybe review that with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| Yes, so there's a retaining wall that is failing and cannot be repaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| so there's capital dollars allocated in the capital budget to replace that wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5198)|
| 1:26:44| and to create a sloped landscape and new real estate for the Fort Kidd play area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5204)|
| 1:26:53| And so this contract is with Hedstrom to help us redesign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5213)|
| 1:26:57| and redevelop the existing Fort Kidd play area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5219)|
| 1:27:00| And I think in looking at that, there was discussion of public meetings that would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| I guess can you maybe speak a little bit to what form those public meetings would take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| Yes, so there's a scope of work for Hedstrom Design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| that would include a public meeting led by Dr. Lyons and I in October| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| where we would receive feedback on what people love about Fort Kidd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| and probably gather some information about people's experiences there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| take that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| Hedstrom Design could then take those ideas, those memories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| and the history of that site and start to lay out some proposals, some ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| work with vendors that do playground installations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| and then we'd have a couple options to look at, go back to the public, get more feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| So we anticipate two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5272)|
| 1:27:55| So one meeting would be basically a meeting with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| to talk about what people like about Fort Kidd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| and what they want to see in a future playground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| and then maybe the second one is more reviewing what designs might come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5283)|
| 1:28:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| Yeah, I just wanted to review that with you, make sure that's what we were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| and that we were going to have that public input, and I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5304)|
| 1:28:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5305)|
| 1:28:26| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Article 2, Division 1, Section 8-26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5311)|

| 1:28:42| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5322)|
| 1:28:43| Let's quickly go over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| The charter, our city charter, says that salary of the municipal judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| shall be prescribed by city council by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5333)|
| 1:28:58| His salary is set at $74,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| It has not been increased since 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| It was added to the list for salary review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| I talked to Vicki Hatfield quite a bit about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| She said the problem with getting accurate results on a salary review is that it's hard to describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5351)|
| 1:29:17| and hard to compare what each judge does across the city and maybe even further out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5357)|
| 1:29:25| State laws may prohibit also maybe different in different states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| and how they can charge and what they collect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| So we looked at five cities in Tennessee, Chattanooga, Jackson, Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5372)|
| 1:29:40| Johnson City, and Murfreesboro to come up with a salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| ranging from the top in Chattanooga at $176,000 and Murfreesboro a little over $70,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5384)|
| 1:29:51| We looked at the number of cases that Judge Rothson handles each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| Through April, when we looked at this, he had done 18,000 cases annualized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5397)|
| 1:30:04| probably out of a little over 54,000 cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| He has city court tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| Last year it was 47,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| The year before that, 37,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| His salary has not been raised since 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| What's in front of you, a $91,258 is what I'm recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| That's just taking a 2.5% increase, which is as any city employee has been received over the last six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5426)|
| 1:30:35| They will receive 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| It's just adding 2.5% to his $74,900 base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| in the years that he has not been given an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| seven years plus the eighth year for a catch-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| which won't take effect until January of 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| That is fixed for another four years, so it has no other potential for any increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5457)|
| 1:31:03| It can't be changed while he has been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| It's with that that I come with this recommendation after quite a bit of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| and talking with Vicki Hatfield and gathering public records for what other city judges make across our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5472)|
| 1:31:19| I think this is a fair, very pragmatic approach, 2.5% each year for those years as other city employees would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5479)|
| 1:31:27| Like elected officials who can't grant, he can't be granted, just like we did with the mayor and we did with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5487)|
| 1:31:34| It can't be an automatic increase or an increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| It has to be brought before council, each one voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| With that, that's a summary of quite a bit of work over the last few months to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5501)|
| 1:31:47| Thank you, Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| Did Judge Rawson request this? Does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| He requested that we look at it, and he didn't request any specific amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| His request reminded me, I guess, that it was up to us to make this change, and did I see fit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5522)|
| 1:32:09| That's when I began to look at it, talk to Vicki Hatfield about it, and then we started doing the research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| I know that he works hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| I've visited him in court in case after case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5538)|
| 1:32:22| It's just all over the place, wages have been stagnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| So I wonder about being concerned about someone who's making a pretty good salary about raising theirs when so many people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5546)|
| 1:32:34| I know that they're not dependent upon each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| I think this is, you know, by ordinance, it said that in there that, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5558)|
| 1:32:51| It said the municipal judge shall receive a salary comparable to that received by county sessions court judges at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| And so I think with that inlay, and with that specifically written that way, that, I mean, he's, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5578)|
| 1:33:06| I mean, based on what I've seen and based on these other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| really looking inside Tennessee and not in other states where Tennessee might be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| With a high of $176,000, I mean, he's a 74.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| So I think it's very much in line, still puts him at the bottom of the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5599)|
| 1:33:24| And I think it was a very pragmatic approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| I mean, we didn't pick just an arbitrary number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| We tried to, you know, it's like, okay, we can base it on the 2.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| But Judge Rossen didn't ask for anything specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| He just said, would you consider looking into it, and that's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| Ms. Hatfield is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| She's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5624)|
| 1:33:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| It's not my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| There are regular analysis, and we voted on the regularity of that, of city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5628)|
| 1:33:55| the civil service protected employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| Like the salaries of city employees aren't stagnant, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| They're regularly reviewed through a salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| She does an annual, she does a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| And it may or may not indicate that there are raises for the civil service positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| and the positions within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| This is one of the examples of the elected positions where they do remain stagnant unless council determines otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5659)|
| 1:34:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5668)|
| 1:34:29| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5677)|

| 1:35:27| On the down low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5728)|
| 1:35:29| So this is an amendment to the motion, so I need a second to the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| So we'll vote on that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265190827?start=5732)|
