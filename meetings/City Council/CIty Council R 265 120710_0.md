| 0:07:21| I'd like Mark to comment briefly on the work on the courtyard development or cottage developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=441)|
| 0:07:26| that they're doing in the heart of Knoxville zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| And I understand that that's a freestanding zone for the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| But tell us about that first, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=452)|
| 0:07:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=455)|
| 0:07:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| Our staff has been working on a new low-density residential zone district that we're calling R1HK for heart of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=460)|
| 0:07:51| Knoxville district that would mimic the development pattern for those neighborhoods around downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=471)|
| 0:07:59| in the heart of Knoxville as far as the dimensional standards in different from the R1 zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=479)|
| 0:08:09| which are very suburban in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Within the proposed R1HK district is a provision for infill that we're calling courtyard development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=492)|
| 0:08:20| which would allow small clusters or pockets of houses to be located on relatively small tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=500)|
| 0:08:29| through the use on review process as we've laid it out in the R1HK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=509)|
| 0:08:38| People in neighborhoods outside of the heart of Knoxville neighborhoods have gotten wind of what we've been proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| and have expressed an interest in having that option for infill development within other zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=524)|
| 0:08:52| So we can take the elements of that that we've proposed within R1HK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| and embed them in the zoning ordinance through the existing zone districts as well as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=537)|
| 0:09:07| So they would not be a directly allowed use but a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=547)|
| 0:09:10| They would come with their plans and during the plan review they could show how they're going to do a courtyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| or some central facing kind of area of public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| We would create development standards that are freestanding within the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| and create a definition and list courtyard development as a use on review in various residential zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=565)|
| 0:09:36| But in the heart of Knoxville, in the center city, we're going to encourage infill housing in essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=576)|
| 0:09:42| Yes, we want to make that available as well as developing in a pattern consistent with the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=582)|
| 0:09:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=590)|
| 0:09:51| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Thank you, Mayor Harrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| Just to add a little bit to what Mark said, it seems to me that this is an opportune time to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| and to ask MPC to come and make recommendations to us, especially given our blighted properties effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=600)|
| 0:10:05| because we have several lots available right now and we probably will have more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=605)|
| 0:10:12| And I just think this dovetails very well with what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I've been following the use of the courtyard concept in some other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=621)|
| 0:10:25| I think it has great promise for solving some of our things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| and the blighted properties initiatives now certainly are a very timely opportunity for us to bring this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| So I look forward to getting the results of your recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Mark, is there a minimum size requirement that's been thrown out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=642)|
| 0:10:47| Do you have anything off the top of your head that might?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| I mean, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| I haven't done enough homework on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| And I haven't read them recently enough to recall them off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| but there are standards that we've drafted that would be used by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| in reviewing any proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| and then they would also have some flexibility to place conditions on any specific application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| in order to make it fit within a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| But we would be looking at parcels that would more than likely be the combination of three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=674)|
| 0:11:21| or four existing lots, something on that order, one or two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| and essentially creating an incentive to redevelop it by allowing a greater density on those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=686)|
| 0:11:40| Mayor, since I have that on my computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| if I would add that his standards show that they're talking about 1,000 square foot buildings with porches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=701)|
| 0:11:49| I guess that's a maximum building coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| And it says up to 12 units per acre, I think, Mark, in your standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| Your drafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| I mean, you're not done with them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| I think it was up to 12 units per development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Okay, let me read that quickly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| It might be both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| Density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| Oh, it's up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| Up to 12 units per acre, it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| Each development shall contain no less than four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| nor more than 10 dwellings on lots around a courtyard or open area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| That's what the current draft looks like anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Okay, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with Neighborhood Housing, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| to provide $56,000 in community development block grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| and $4,000 in Empowerment Zone Minor Home Repair Program income for the Minor Home Repair Program Operation Backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=764)|
| 0:12:51| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| Becky, I was wondering a couple of things in reading through this, and I may have just missed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| but on both of these resolutions that are coming up in terms of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| it talks about the homeowner being required to live in the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| but I didn't see anywhere where there was a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| No, there's not a time limit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Has that been a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| I know both of these have been very successful, but has that been a problem?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| We haven't found that to be a problem, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| These are typically small dollar repairs focused on emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=805)|
| 0:13:33| This is, you know, these funds are provided to these subrecipients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| and so this work is done as a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=821)|
| 0:13:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| We're cutting back on cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Our energy efficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| These programs have been going on for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| How many homes have you actually done since this program has been underway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| Do you have a waiting list for people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| There is a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Both CAC and Neighborhood Housing have waiting lists for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| We've got some representatives here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| Jason Estes is here from CAC, and he manages the Emergency Home Repair Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=858)|
| 0:14:25| He could probably speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=865)|
| 0:14:38| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Jason Estes, 7801 Cortland Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Currently, we probably have about over 1,300 people on a waiting list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=884)|
| 0:14:51| We typically do 100-plus jobs a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| We do a lot of repairs like HVAC, roofs, plumbing, electrical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| all emergency-type repairs to help homeowners be able to stay inside their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| It's a very needed program, and we've been doing it for many years and helped a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=911)|
| 0:15:26| Thank you, Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| David Alt, Neighborhood Housing, 9957 Tierra Verde, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| It's a pleasure to be on the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| Fourteenth season for Operation Backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| To answer your question, 800 homes repaired with over 8,000 volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| We mainly kind of pick up a little niche of roof repairs and a lot of accessibility repair program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=945)|
| 0:15:52| Well, I know this has been a real successful program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| and I just wanted to be sure to let everybody know how successful it is and what a good job you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=958)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Yes, I wanted to ask about the Empowerment Zone funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| I was sort of under the impression that there was not many funds left for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| But how are we standing in terms of what's left?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| There's no grant funds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| This is program income that we're getting back from some of the programs that we implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| during the Empowerment Zone contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| Some of that was structured as a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| And so as we get payments back, we can use that program income for other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Because we had to decrease the amount of community development block grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| for some of our subrecipients this year, because we were cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| we plugged in some EZ program income to make up the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1001)|
| 0:16:46| so that they can continue to serve the same number of families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1010)|
| 0:16:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1014)|

| 0:17:38| Mayor, I had talked to Ms. Weatherstone prior to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| and asked if she might just give us kind of an update| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1061)|
| 0:17:44| since the last time they were here in terms of Menvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| and also the work that the case managers are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| I'd be happy to thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| Jenny Weatherstone, 9025 Candlewood Drive, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| What I would like to tell you about Menvilla is that it is a year and a half old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1083)|
| 0:18:09| heading into its second anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| It reached 100% capacity before the end of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| People have moved out into independent living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| and we're very glad for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| Currently, I think there are 54 in residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| with three applicants which have been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| and will be moving in for the vacant units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| They are awaiting their Section 8 vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| So all of them receive case management from case managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| whose office is within the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| So it has been highly successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| The Emergency Solutions Grant that you are looking at now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| goes to help support the case management that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1128)|
| 0:18:51| at the Resource Center across the street from Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| And it's this program that works with individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| who are seeking to leave homelessness on a permanent basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| and who are willing to work towards that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| So they're attending classes, they're working a case plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| and we are proud of our success with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| Last year there were 139 individuals and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| that moved out of homelessness into housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| as a result of the work of the Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1157)|

| 0:20:33| I guess he's still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| If you'd come up and just tell us a bit about the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| because it does serve a group of people in public housing, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| Yes, this program is, we've been doing this for about 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1242)|
| 0:20:46| this partnership with KCDC where Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| provides various recreational programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| and some of the high rises, Cagle Terrace,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| Isabella Tower, Love Tower, Northgate Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| So we have individuals, center leaders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| that go into those programs during the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| and do various in the sundry programming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| for those individuals living in those high rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| As well as we do some working with inner city youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| This fund goes to help us provide fees and equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| for various inner city efforts, football, baseball, basketball, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1280)|
| 0:21:26| And KCDC's actually got the folks on the ground running this portion of it, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| No, this is all run by Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| These are city employees doing this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| I think it all started back as KCDC began phasing out of the recreation business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| As they were closing down college homes, Austin homes, Lonsdale homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| they had recreation centers in there originally and those were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| Had their own centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| And as those were phased out, KCDC started granting us these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| to help provide that recreational programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1317)|

| 0:22:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Before I ask my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| thank public service for jumping in with our most recent storm event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| But I have a question on these trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| We are getting these from a company in La Follette, which is Campbell County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Is there a vendor in Knox County that would be eligible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| when it's time to put out an RFP for these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| We competitively bid that, and that's bid to folks all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1384)|
| 0:23:10| Obviously, if you've got a nursery or access to trees regionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| you're usually in the ballpark for trying to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| There are nurseries in Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I don't know if there's large enough nurseries to supply the trees that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| But typically we've gotten a vendor that has selected trees from nurseries all over East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| So he selects, you know, Wes and All in the Garden is the vendor that accesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| and buys trees, and they may buy from a number of vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| Sometimes they bought from folks down in Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1419)|
| 0:23:41| If we've had a specialty tree, Moon's Tree Farm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| they have to buy from a specific nursery that meets the guidelines of the state for being a nursery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1424)|
| 0:23:50| So it's competitively bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| It's a final year for this contract, and then this contract will be rebid probably in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| And, obviously, we love to have local folks compete on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| But Wes has also been a very good and responsive vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| This question came to me, and I'm just passing it along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| David, as long as you're up there, help me with the math here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| I was reading through this, and you talk about your budget being $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| and you're applying and getting, in essence, a grant from the state of up to $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| which sounds a lot like $70,000, except you start talking about a contract up to $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| So how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Well, it's a not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1470)|
| 0:24:31| So if we don't have the funding, we won't spend more than we have in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| And, you know, trees are kind of funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| A lot of folks get excited about trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1478)|
| 0:24:40| So throughout the year we have opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| We have citizens that call and want to donate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Keep Knoxville Beautiful applies for grants occasionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| So I wanted a little cushion so I didn't have to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| So it's a not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1490)|
| 0:24:51| So you can expand their services up to $80,000 is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Yeah, it's a not to exceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| So, you know, if we don't have the funding, you know, we're not going to be able to spend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| Right now we have $50,000 budgeted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| Mayor O'Hara increased the planting budget by $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| We had $40,000 originally, you know, historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| And so we've applied for this grant for $20,000, and then we anticipate getting some funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| We've gotten to the last five or six fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| I just had my shoes off, and I was toting, and I couldn't get to $80,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1517)|
| 0:25:18| With regard to these trees, is there any opportunity from either the Department of Agriculture on the federal level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| or the state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| I thought they had a program where they had, what, urban reforestation bare root trees that they provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| I realize they're smaller trees, but do you get any trees that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| Yeah, they're called whips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| They're just small, very small-caliber trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| They're bare root.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1542)|
| 0:25:43| We can get as many whips as we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| The mortality on those is pretty high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| But we can get whips from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| The tape dollars, it's my understanding, those are pass-through federal dollars anyway through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| But we do occasionally get the smaller-caliber trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| You know, typically you'll go out and use those in kind of a mass planting area, like a reforestation for a hillside or an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| We've used those sometimes to replant around areas that have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| maybe we've taken down some houses and we're going to return it to a green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| But that's not been our primary focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| And you're talking about two-inch-caliber type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Well, we've always planted about an inch, inch-and-a-half-caliber tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| The city tree board, which helps advise us, they're a citizen and volunteer tree board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| they help advise us on trees and tree planting specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| They felt like we needed to go up to a two-inch-caliber tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| Is it because the survival rate's better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| No, I think you get, I mean, really the survival rate with one-inch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| and one-inch, inch-and-a-half-caliber trees actually is a little greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| It's kind of like when you take that tree out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| It's like I'm 40 and you try to take me out and throw me somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| It's harder on me compared to my five-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| So the same thing with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| They have a higher survivability, actually inch, inch-and-a-half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| But we also have issues in parks with smaller diameter trees getting abused sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| They get hit by mowers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| You know, they're a little more fragile and kids can break off limbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| And so we felt like a two-inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| We were going to try that for a couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| And we planted, I don't know, about half last year, two-inch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| half-inch-and-a-caliber, so we're just trying a slightly larger diameter tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| And we'll see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| We'll watch the mortality rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Kent, if people in neighborhoods want to sort of foster trees in their area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| can they contact you about these smaller bare-root trees if they're willing to take care of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| and put them in or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Is there some way they can work with your department to accelerate the retreeing of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| Yeah, well, there's really a few ways that folks can get, obviously, trees requests into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| They can go through Dave Massey, Office of Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| They can e-mail me directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| They can call 311.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| We want to – our planting schedule is a combination of our experts, our arborists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| and the tree board experts identifying locations and needs based on plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| And then we take requests from neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| So it's really a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| We want to meet with the customer's desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| We also want to make sure that we're planting the right tree in the right location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| So we may have customers that say, I want this tulip popper right underneath these power lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| We're obviously going to try to direct that type of planting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Right tree in the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Right tree, right location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| Let's get the best trees, best survivability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| And so, obviously, if folks have a request and they're involved in a neighborhood group, we're out there through Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| And if not and they're an individual, they can e-mail me or they can just call 311 and get to my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| I was just thinking if you had help nurturing and keeping them alive, you'd have a higher survival rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| If you had a neighborhood group that was willing to adopt some trees or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| We found that trees in public spaces really were the best folks to care for those typically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| But, obviously, like Basilian Blooms, Dogwood Arts Festival has a Basilian Blooms program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Those are oftentimes on private property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| And those smaller bare root trees really need a homeowner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| They need to be in a yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| You know, public space with cars driving through medians and dogs and children and, you know, our mowers are big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| Rough on those small trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Yeah, it's just rough on the small trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| And the smaller caliper are great in private sector, you know, households and their yards, households.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Mr. Brace, you just answered the question I was going to ask about the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| And you just touched on that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| So that's pretty much with the joint decision with the tree board and your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| We're actually drafting that list right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1758)|
| 0:29:21| So if council members have requests, if your constituents, if our customers have requests, get those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1761)|
| 0:29:27| Obviously, we typically have more requests than we have resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| But we try to, again, work with our certified arborist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| We're going to actually post for that forester position very soon, which, you know, kudos to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| That position should be posted in the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| So hopefully a forester will be up here talking about this in the future and not the public service director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| So when folks want to get those requests in, we'll then mesh those, and we take them to the tree board and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| Here's our list for the next planting season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| They review that, make suggestions, and then we try to plant about December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| We want the list done about August, late August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| I can get that to Wes, and he can start to shop around for the trees he needs to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| and we can get those in the ground when they're dormant in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| Excuse me, in December and January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| You can maximize survival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| I mean, you want to plant trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| I think folks in the spring, it gets warm, and everybody wants to go plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| That's really not a great time to plant trees unless you're going to intensely maintain them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| So we plant December, January, February, ideally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| Well, he's one step ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1826)|
| 0:30:27| I just wanted to know, to have an update on the urban forester, where we stood on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Yeah, and we went through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| We went and worked with civil service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Obviously, they have to create a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| That's been created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| We reviewed the training and experience questionnaire for that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| It should be posted soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1842)|
| 0:30:43| Ms. Branscombe is going to lead a committee, myself, and probably our operations person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| maybe Mr. Walsh or the Greenway coordinator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| We'll have a committee of folks to review applications, and we're going to post it nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| We're going to get into a couple of national publications that foresters are involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| and try to get some good solicitation for applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| Looking forward to having them on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1865)|

| 0:32:26| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Mark, just briefly, we're looking at allowing, what, retail services, restaurant services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1949)|
| 0:32:38| and industrial zones to not just serve the tenants of that industrial park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| but anyone generally so they have a better chance of survival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| Is that what you're trying to accomplish here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Generally, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| That particular line of permitted uses in the I-3 District has been troublesome for several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1970)|
| 0:32:59| It requires codes and permitting to make the judgment call as to whether that particular store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| or shop serves only the industrial uses that surround it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| And then we've got a couple of trends happening where more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| and more people have to expand and broaden their service areas in order to make a go of it in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=1994)|
| 0:33:21| And then we've got some cases where manufacturing operations are expanding into wholesale sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2001)|
| 0:33:30| and looking at retail sales and, in some cases, in I-3 zone districts near downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| actually looking to do all of that plus restaurants on the same site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| So it's a change in how we do business, basically, in the real world here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| We're trying to broaden it to make it a little more mixed use and address those past patterns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2026)|
| 0:33:53| And it seemed this was the easiest way to do that rather than to tweak the C-2 District, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2033)|
| 0:34:00| to allow manufacturing and production and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2040)|
| 0:34:07| add the retail service and eating and drinking establishments to the industrial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Mark, I mean, I raised the question about the signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| I mean, the sign requirement for industrial is a lot more restrictive than what a retail outlet would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| And how are you going to overcome that when they come back and we give them a retail outlet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| be it a convenience store, and now we don't have enough signage for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| They're either going to want something else, something more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| So how are you going to deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| Generally, the sign allowance for the industrial districts is pretty aggressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2084)|
| 0:34:53| I don't see big signs on industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2093)|
| 0:34:55| No, but they're a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| I think it's two to four feet per lineal foot of street frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| which is greater than a couple of the commercial districts on the same order of magnitude anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2107)|
| 0:35:08| Rather than the current regulations don't differentiate between types of uses within a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| They just have an allowance per district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| And the sign code task force is looking at that, so we'll have the opportunity to take that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2120)|
| 0:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2126)|
| 0:35:27| I thought he was going to say baby golden arches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| 12B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Article 4, Section 3.1, RP1, 2, and 3, regarding development standards for subdivisions within the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| and ridgetop protection areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| Councilman Dellivolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| I guess I need to ask about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Mark, we spent literally months working on the general hillside and ridgetop protection plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2157)|
| 0:36:05| and one of the, what, the naysayer group was the developers concerned that perhaps they didn't have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2165)|
| 0:36:15| to plan their proposed project if they didn't know all the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2175)|
| 0:36:24| And this approach tries to make it flexible so that they have to do less things like smaller driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2184)|
| 0:36:30| and everything else and less land disturbance, and that's a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| But what about that aspect of the question that they had raised is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| if I don't know until I go through a whole use on review process whether I can make money developing this or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| I can't really start planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| And so how do you address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| I mean, there isn't like a minimum in here, and then you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| but we'll adjust it on use on review or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| There's not a discrete number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| So what do we do about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Well, this particular amendment to the zoning regulations is coupled with the amendment to the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2216)|
| 0:37:03| that's found at 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| Coming next, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| And that particular amendment is applicable only to those projects that are within a planned zone district anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2225)|
| 0:37:13| So they're already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| So they're always going to submit a plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| They're always already in that process in order to avail themselves to these reduced minimum standards on the subdivision side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| That ought to save them money, smaller roads and smaller frontage and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| It's density neutral and cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| So those are two good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| Have you had any developer involvement in the creation of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| In other words, were they coming to you with suggestions or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| Actually, there were developers on the hillside and ridge top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| I understand that, but I'm talking about the subdivision regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Yeah, but the regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| And these regulations were spelled out almost verbatim within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| So we're literally implementing the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| So we beat it to death is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| Yeah, you could say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2279)|
| 0:38:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| Well, one issue I have about it is, and I'd like for you to explain this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| but one of the concerns when we were talking about the hillside slope issue was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| how do I know my property is in and would be affected long before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| How do I know that prior to writing a contract and getting involved with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Can you explain that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| If you're looking at rezoning your property, you're going to go to KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| and you will see both in relationship to the land use classifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2309)|
| 0:38:34| the land use map, and the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| you'll see the hillside and ridgetop protection area described.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| So at any point, at the beginning point of a rezoning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| they will know whether their property is in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| If they don't have to rezone it, they're not subject to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| It doesn't come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| The recommendations found in the hillside and ridgetop protection plan are triggered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| by a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| So if I have a 50-acre parcel and I want to rezone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| it will show on KGIS that part of it is in or all of it is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2351)|
| 0:39:16| or part of it is in the protected area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2359)|

| 0:40:13| Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2413)|

| 0:43:03| Well, here again, you know, Dwayne, you have a potential sign issue going in C3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| in an area that doesn't have 50-foot signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2588)|
| 0:43:13| and would it be better to look at a zoning that's a, you know, a planned commercial zone where you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| I mean, the west of that property, there's no, not many tall signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| and to the east of that property, there's, it's right in, you're kind of right in a transition area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| and you want to deal with that now and talk about that now or don't let it go through C3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| and, you know, typically fast food's going to want a large sign again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| and I don't, I'm trying to avoid trying to get in another situation like we got into in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| so I have something to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Or do you don't care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2627)|
| 0:43:48| No, I don't have a problem at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2628)|
| 0:43:49| I think this is one of the things that the sign task force is looking into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| and hopefully that we can come to some resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| But, again, I think this is one of those things where we talk to the business folks about it, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| during this transition period, so I don't have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| It'll be too late then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2644)|
| 0:44:05| I mean, if you, you know, if you go back and ask for a planned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| you could alter that now as opposed to finding it down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| That's my only, I mean, it's in another area, just like, just, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| there's no signs on the, on large signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120710?start=2656)|
