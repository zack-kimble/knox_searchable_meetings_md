| 0:03:25| First, we will set the agenda and approve the minutes. Then we have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| brief public forum. After that, I'm going to call on Mayor Jacobs for just a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| minutes. Then we will jump into the agenda. Commissioner Jay? Yes. Commissioner Lundy? I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=215)|
| 0:03:46| wondering if we can take a moment of silence before we set the agenda in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| loss of the Austinese student, Stanley Freeman Jr. Yes. As soon as we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| done outlining this, then I'll call on you. Maybe you could recap the events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| leading up to this and understand it. As I've outlined tonight's run of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=242)|
| 0:04:10| show, do I hear any objections before I move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| Seeing none, let us... Before we set the agenda, I'll call on you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=255)|

| 0:04:46| guy who was 16 years old named Stanley Freeman Jr. was murdered on Friday. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| it's been a very tough weekend for our community. So, I just want to ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=293)|

| 0:05:07| moment of silence, lifting our community up. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=307)|

| 0:10:53| activity is involved, missing vaccine protocol devises law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| investigation. In addition to KPD's involvement, I have requested that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=657)|

| 0:11:10| corrective action so that it doesn't happen again. Knox County's policy is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| not comment on current investigations. So with this in mind, I am respectfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| requesting that you do not ask Dr. Buchanan for information regarding the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| missing vaccines until the investigations are concluded. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=685)|

| 0:11:43| well. But do you have a estimate of the even if it's a broad estimate of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| timeline of both the investigation and the audit? Um, is this a matter of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| weeks, months or? Sorry, Chairman. For the KPD and investigation again, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=712)|
| 0:12:01| we don't think there's any criminal activity involved here, we anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| that was going to be over pretty quickly. Uh, you know, within a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| weeks, I'd say, uh, few and company will be longer. That will be a matter of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| Are there questions for Mayor Jacobs from any of the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| Commissioner Daly. Mr. Mayor, could you clarify that, according to the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=742)|
| 0:12:28| media, we will not accept Pfizer. I believe that is not a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| That's a great question, Commissioner. Thank you so much. What happened was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| the state asked all the health departments. Would you prefer prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| Pfizer? Moderna? Dr Buchanan stated to the state that she would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| Moderna because it's easier to handle than Pfizer. Pfizer is the one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| has to be kept at minus 80 degrees, and it is really, um, very inconvenient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| to deal with in the store. Um, so the future shipments should be more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| bearing up. But if there is extra Pfizer was certainly taken on. And to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| be clear, we did not opt out or say we don't want Pfizer. Dr Buchanan just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=791)|
| 0:13:16| made clear their reference. If it's available, it's one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=796)|
| 0:13:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| And and also, uh, Mr Mr Mayor, I want to make sure people realize that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| you receive the first dose of Pfizer, there will be a second dose. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| thanks. Thanks for that out as well, Commissioner. Um, and currently, of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| course, what we're going to do is, uh, the missing vaccine was actually second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| doses. So we have extra first doses. So those will be used for the second dose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| of the folks that got the first dose of Pfizer. Um, and, yeah, and any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=830)|
| 0:13:56| second doses of fires that are made will be sent to us. But, yeah, no one's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=836)|

| 0:14:04| Unfortunately, this will result in a delay. But the vaccination efforts by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| the health department continue unabated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| There are other questions for the mayor from any of our commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=854)|

| 0:15:31| here to speak on the strategic vision of Knox County. As I understand, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| commission will be having a retreat in April on this topic, and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| offer my thoughts for your consideration at this retreat and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| general, as you decide how to focus your efforts in pushing Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| forward over the next 10 years or so. As Commissioner Durrett pointed out last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| month, this commission has wasted a large amount of its precious time on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| the board of health issue rather than on any of the other items of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| business that the commission could have been working on. Sure, the mundane and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| required items have gotten done, but little else of substance has that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=962)|
| 0:16:07| help the residents of Knox County deal with the pandemic or its effects. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| example, on November 22nd, Commissioner Ward posted on his now apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=971)|

| 0:16:23| psychological damage done to people in our community and expressed concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| about companies and families having to file bankruptcy because of board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| health restrictions. So over the last few months, there have been a plenty of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| moves, mostly by Commissioners Ward and Biggs, to try and replace or undermine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| the board of health as a body. I think now that the board of health question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| is on pause until April, and let's be honest, we all know you're going to vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| to get rid of the board in April when it comes up for a vote. How about now you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| start to address how this commission can help people who have been affected by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| the pandemic? All those things that Commissioner Ward was so concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| back in November, you've got time to start thinking about those things now, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| would say. Beyond those issues, though, I think this commission should start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| thinking a little more long term about the fact that Knox County is changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1022)|
| 0:17:06| and growing and will continue to do so. If you've heard me talk before, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| know, I think the Knox County strategic plan under Mayor Jacobs and before him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Mayor Burchett has amounted to development for the sake of developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| I think part of the theory behind this so called strategic vision is to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| the tax base as quickly as possible, make sure there's enough housing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| people flooding into Knox County and so that Mayor's Burchett and Jacobs can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| keep to their responsible pledges of no property tax increases. In the meantime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| over the last 20 or so years, while property values have gone up, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| property tax rate has gone down $120 for $100 of assessed value and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1056)|

| 0:18:26| see more details. My problem with going forward with the stadium plan is that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1106)|

| 0:19:07| pushback. It's a divisive move and moreover, absolutely unnecessary. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1147)|

| 0:20:22| little bit of context about how the criminal justice system works in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| County and the way that a facility like that might might be able to be used or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| might not be able to be used post pandemic. Um, as I'm sure some or many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| of you are aware in Knox County, we are currently under a Supreme Court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| where we're doing almost everything remotely. Um, very few cases are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| heard in person, but many of them, be they change of plea hearings, be they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| violation, probation, revocation hearings. Almost everything is taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| place remotely. Um, but I think that it is important for everyone to know and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1252)|
| 0:20:57| understand that the only reason why we're able to function that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| currently is because there is a current Tennessee Supreme Court order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| suspending the rules of criminal procedure. And for those who may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| have spent a lot of time in the courtroom, the rules of criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| procedure is something that is put down at the state level that sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1270)|
| 0:21:13| lays out what the rights are. Um, well, what the rights are of certain accused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| individuals, criminal defendants, but then also sort of lays out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| procedure that one has to follow as they navigate through the system. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| so while while I agree that right now we're facing tremendous challenges in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Knox County, um, with lack of infrastructure, um, in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| conducting things remotely, you know, obviously this called everybody off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| guard. Um, I do wonder or worry how much utility this facility would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| going forward. My understanding is that if they if the if the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| department was not required to seek bids, they could have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| operational as early as the beginning of May. Um, if bids were required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| what I have heard is possibly september. Um, I don't know where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| gonna be pandemic wise by september. I'm hopeful that we will have had an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| opportunity to be vaccinated. We'll be able to move past this. But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| that it's important to note that once the Supreme Court order is lifted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| we're no longer under the state of emergency status, almost all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| hearings that we are that we are currently doing remotely, we will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| be permitted to do remotely absent some sort of other change in the law. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| so essentially what the rules of criminal procedure would provide for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| it arraignments and initial appearances only basically about the only types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| hearings that could be that could happen remotely. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| and and right now we're already doing most initial appearances occur remotely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| um on felony charges. Those are those are currently being done by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| magistrates remotely. Um that was the case pre pandemic. Um I recognize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| facility would uh open up some availability for child support cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| that are heard that were that would continue to be able to be used in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| future. Um but but there's there's another aspect to this that I think is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| important to consider, which is, you know, currently if it's a felony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| charge, those are are conducted remotely and have been conducted remotely pre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| pandemic. That's not a pandemic thing. Typically though, people charged with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| low level misdemeanors are transported to court. And and one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| why we've set the system up that way is because it's it's the drunk tech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| situation. You know, somebody charged with criminal trespass or public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| intoxication. Um the type of offenses that we see a lot of homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| individuals pick up uh and pick up frequently. A lot of times they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| transported to court and they have their arraignment in court. Um and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| D. A. S. Office is making offers on those cases and oftentimes those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| individuals are pleading guilty to time served. You know, they've spent their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| couple of nights in jail and they're getting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| in my mind, it would make sense to keep transporting those those individuals to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| court. I mean, you could conduct conduct those arraignments remotely, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| you're not actually saving any money because what ends up happening is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| case is now going to get rescheduled because you cannot accept the plea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| remotely once the Supreme Court order is lifted. And so the person will set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| another couple days in jail at the cost of camera for $74 $77 a day to house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| somebody in jail. And again, these are mostly homeless individuals or very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| very poor. Their court costs are not getting paid, but you know, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| like they're paying that $77 back at the conclusion of that. And you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| still gonna have to transport them. It's just are we going to pay more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| money to keep them in jail for longer and potentially increase our jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| numbers? And so, you know, I'm not coming here trying to say, you know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| think we should build it or I think that we should not build it. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| think that I think that I wanted to provide the commission that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| be available to answer any questions and just sort of point out that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| only reason we're able to operate the way that we're currently operating is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| because of the Supreme Court order. And when that goes away, um, you know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| wonder if we're gonna have a facility that doesn't get a whole lot of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| Thank you, Mr Lutton. Um, we have a couple of questions. I wanted to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| start with one question of, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| um, what is there any pending litigation that you know of on a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| level that would change? Sorry, pending legislation, litigation, legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| that would that would change that those operating standards that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| I'm not aware of any currently pending legislation now. Okay, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Biggs. Thank you, Chairman J. So, Defender Lutton, are you saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1520)|
| 0:25:27| the courtrooms and things of that nature are still going to be in use from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| downtown out to where we're where we're the proposed building sites going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| be? And you're saying that specific people that fit a specific demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1537)|
| 0:25:42| are still gonna have to be transported back downtown as well. Is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| way you could email me where the data that you're speaking of where you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| that from police there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| Yeah, I can. I can send you an email, Commissioner Biggs. I can also point you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| to rules of criminal procedure. Rule 43 lays out when audio visual equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| could be used on its specific for essentially two purposes, either initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| appearances or arraignments. There is a provision in Rule 43 also. I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1568)|
| 0:26:15| on getting too technical, but in Rule 43 that also allows for, um, where a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| defendant's presence is not required. If a defendant's presence isn't required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| obviously they're not entitled to be transported to court. But those are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| limited subset of issues like, uh, like questions of law where there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| question of fact. So that would be if if I were saying that an indictment was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| invalid on its face or something, um, you know that it didn't. It didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| allege an offense or something. Then, um, a person's presence is not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| to be in court. So I think that what we're really talking about our initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| appearances and arraignments on I think that when you factor in that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| already doing much of that remotely, you're on the felonies. Anyway, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| misdemeanors. I think that it makes sense to continue to bring people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| court because I think that it helps to keep our jail numbers lower, and you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| gonna have to transport them to do the plea anyway. So I think what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| really talking about is probably a not super large number of cases that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| criminal court, initial appearances on violations of probation, um, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| initial appearances on, uh, on new charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| And answer your question, Commissioner Riggs. Uh, yes, sir. Partially. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| I'll circle back after everybody's through. Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1648)|
| 0:27:36| You're muted. Thank you, Mr, uh, um, Latin for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1656)|
| 0:27:45| My, um, commission had received an email that the estimated annual savings to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1665)|
| 0:27:55| our county would be. I believe it was about $100,000 a year, if I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| mistaken. If we were to build this facility that it would save in, um, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1680)|
| 0:28:06| a transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| Is it your opinion that, um, there would there it would not result in in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1689)|
| 0:28:20| savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| of transporting, um, prisoners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| I'm not. I'm certainly not gonna say that it wouldn't result in in some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| savings if you weren't transporting those individuals over specifically for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| criminal court arraignments. Um, I can't really. I feel like I can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1715)|
| 0:28:41| intelligently answer the question about $100,000 savings. I'm not in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| position to disagree with that. I've not. I've not seen that information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| and I don't know where those numbers are pulled from to be able to say, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| whether or not I think that that would be an actual savings. And I mean, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| those numbers were to include the misdemeanor cases that we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| transport, I would suggest that perhaps you could say that you're gonna save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| money by not by not transporting people on those misdemeanors. But if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| transport him today, but the rules are still gonna require you to transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| him in two days, they're just gonna spend two extra days in court. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| look at that as an actual savings. And so I guess I would just have to see how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| those numbers are broken down it to be able to intelligently, uh, intelligent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| excuse me, intelligently comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| Um, perhaps you could also stay with us through to the agenda item in case those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| do come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Um, yes, I would. I appreciate that. Um, uh, Commissioner J. I think it's I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1774)|
| 0:29:42| think it's important that we're comparing apples to apples here. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| and, um, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| that, um, our elected official and public defender also has equal, um, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1789)|
| 0:30:00| input and access to these facts and figures that we've been given because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| we want to make sure that that this that this information we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| from all parties is is accurate and correct. I have no reason to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| it's not, but this is something that, um, I really hadn't been made aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| until, uh, public defender Lutton brought this to our attention. So thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1824)|

| 0:30:30| Thank you, Mr Chair. If the sheriff is there, I'd like to hear from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1830)|
| 0:30:35| sheriff because, uh, what his response is to, uh, defender Lutton share for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| Mhm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| Hey, Sheriff. Good evening. Point of order, Mr Chairman. Yeah. Should we not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| be discussing this during the agenda item? And this is public forum, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| allows the public to address commission. And we're supposed to be into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| dialogue. Yeah, what our rules say. So well, today we have to the only two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1864)|
| 0:31:11| people on the public forum left are Mr Lutton and Mr Hammond from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| criminal court office. So I'm gonna I'd like to do this. I'd like to just move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| item number. What is this? Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| what is that item number 27? I just like to move item 27 to the front right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| now. If I can get a motion in a second on item 27 open up the discussion, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| can continue the dialogue, bring in the sheriff and just address this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| right here. Point of order. Yes, sir. Once we get this moved, it still has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| be a motion on the floor before discussion can take place. Correct. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| the motion unless I hear an objection for everybody, I'd like to just address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| item number 27 now, um, and move it to the front of the agenda. And if I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| get a motion, uh, to then again, to open up the discussion motion to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1921)|
| 0:32:08| item 27 to the front of the agenda. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| Actually, I think I have the ability to I think as a chair, I just have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| ability to move it forward. The motion I would be looking for be a motion for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| next week. Is that correct? Motion to move forward without recommendation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1941)|
| 0:32:25| our regular meeting. Thank you very much. Okay. Second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1945)|
| 0:32:29| Daly and a first by Commissioner Smith to move forward to next week without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| recommendation. And I'll continue to open up the discussion. Um, Mr Daly, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1954)|
| 0:32:40| believe you had the floor and you were calling on the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| That is correct. If the sheriff wants to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Sheriff, you remember the question? Uh, go ahead and repeat it again. Well, Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| Lutton said that he didn't think that after the Supreme Court changes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| zoom type meetings that this building would not be necessary and that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1979)|
| 0:33:04| probably would not be be useful, I guess. And best I could remember. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1984)|
| 0:33:11| I'm just having you to give us your opinion. Well, I've been on some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| zoom meetings with the judges and those who are involved with all of this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| listen to it and also had a representative sit in and listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| What I did, let me answer your question first. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| depending on what the Supreme Court judges say, uh, there's still talk of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| continuing using this. One of the things that he mentioned was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| they're already doing it, but we only have one, um, video arraignment camera| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| and not in each courtroom. So what this is going to do is give six video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| arraignment areas so the courts can be going on at the same time. Uh, when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| say that, so criminal court can have more than one camera sessions court can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| have more than one. And when you're only when they're, uh, I guess not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| combating, but when they're looking for time to get on the camera to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| have their arraignments from another court, then you're having delays, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| means, uh, some of the civil, civil, criminal sessions, all of those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2060)|
| 0:34:27| looking for time to get on there. Uh, they can only get on at certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| So now they're having to bid the time that they want to use that. Uh, I see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2071)|
| 0:34:36| continuing and it's not just a money saving issue. It's also a safety factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| issue of transportation. Uh, I got into this because of all of the issues we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| were having and I contacted a couple of the judges and said, Hey, what about if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| I do what I have proposed now about putting a building out there to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| this happen? Uh, I stepped up to the plate and I've also heard somebody say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| well, can't we just take it out of our budget? I did this for the for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| community of Knox County. This was not just a total benefit for the sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| office. This benefits all of Knox County, all the courts and those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| that are involved. And I think that's where I stepped into it. And it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| like you that, well, everybody says the sheriff is now wanting more money for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| this and that. I did that for a cumulative reason for Knox County. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2124)|
| 0:35:30| Chairman, this is my account and I'd like to get in on the discussion if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| could. Um, yes, go ahead. Actually, let me, uh, Mr Ward is up next. Did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2132)|
| 0:35:39| want to jump in before Mr Hammond or would you like? I didn't know if he had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| a specific question. No, no, no, Mr Hamming and go ahead of me. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| Okay. Uh, Mr Chairman, I asked the sheriff one clarifying question on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| statement. Sure. Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| Hello, Sheriff Spangler. Yes, sir. When you say there is one camera, do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2154)|
| 0:35:59| mean in the current facility you have out there? There is only one camera for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2159)|
| 0:36:03| use for all of the all the judges at Knox County to share. There's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| for criminal court. There's one for sessions for civil court, things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| that. So if you have more than more and in sessions court, if all four or five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| sessions are going on, they have to get time for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| Okay, thank you, sir. Mr Hammond, if you would identify yourself and yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| uh, Mark Hammond, uh, criminal court clerk room 1 49 City County building. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| have been in discussions on these zoom meetings that the sheriff referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| Also, Mr Lutton was there as well. I've also been in conversation with our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| judges, and they have given me permission to give to you their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| thoughts on this. And so I'd like to do that now if I could. I want to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| a couple of figures. First of all, in 2019, the sheriff's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| transported over 21,000 inmates to the City County building from the detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| facility. That's 25 miles down, 25 miles back. Plus the safety factor. They get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| him up early in the morning. They get him fed. They get him dress. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| transport him to City County building. Once they get here, then they're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| lockdown because they have holding areas where they await their hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| So, you know, they could be here one hour. It could be several hours, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| know, waiting on their hearings. Another thing, too, is that, um, in in talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| to the different judges, I wanted to address each of them individually. If I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| might judge Erwin, our juvenile court judge is 100% behind this. Now they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| have been doing this for two years on Skype, and they have three magistrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| who in the morning will take 15 to 20 minutes each to do the business that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| they need to do with the inmates at the detention facility. That could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| anywhere from 10 to 30 inmates. The issue that they have is with Skype.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2267)|
| 0:37:53| Sometimes the connections are not good. Sometimes things drop in and out, as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| might imagine, with Skype. So from a technology standpoint, it is not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| So he has given me permission to tell you he is 100% behind this because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| having a facility where they could actually go in and have the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| right there eliminates the technology problems they have with Skype. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| they've already been doing this for two years. Another one is our magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| Our magistrates will access, uh, inmates three times a day at 12 30 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| the morning at eight o'clock in the morning and again in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| What they do is they will take a laptop and they will take it into the pod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| Now, as you might imagine, it's noisy. Everybody hears everybody's business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| and that's not the ideal way to do these types of things. So the magistrates are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| 100% in favor of having this facility just so they can take the inmates away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| from the pod and have a place where they can go. That's quiet, private, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2326)|
| 0:38:51| they don't have everybody hearing their business out there. I will tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| that the judges, the criminal judges, all three of them are in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2335)|
| 0:39:01| I will tell you, I talked to Judge Jackson today, who has talked with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| of the sessions courts, court judges. They are in favor of this. Uh, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| reason I'm getting involved is because we deal with the inmates almost every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| day when they're here. We deal with, of course, the cases that we have were also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| involved in helping with the technology. Another figure that I will throw out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| for you is that in 2019 and I'm using 2019 because 2020 cases, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2361)|
| 0:39:28| is not giving us a really accurate projection of that. But the magistrates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| office that I mentioned, they take the laptop into the pod where it's noisy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| and everybody hears their business, and sometimes they can't communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| because it's so noisy. They actually accessed 5463 people in 2019. So will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2379)|
| 0:39:49| this facility be used? Absolutely. It will be used the day that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| completed. The very next morning, you'll have your juvenile judges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| magistrates who will access it. You're gonna have your magistrates are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| to access it. It's going to give us more opportunity for child support and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| child custody cases. I do believe that Judge McMillan and Fourth Circuit will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| have an opportunity to use it. Eso question. Will it be used? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| Now, I'm not a lawyer, and I can't address Rule 43 and all of that. I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| tell you, though, that our judges have said that they're working with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| state Supreme Court, the administrative office of the courts to talk about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| this will work moving forward. Yes, if the pandemic is over tomorrow, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| will need to be some changes in the rules with regards to some of the cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| that Mr Lutton mentioned about being able to transport them or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| transport them. Those are some issues that will have to be worked out. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| do know that there are discussions ongoing with the Supreme Court about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| the rules and how the rules could be altered so that more video could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| used. But again, that's gonna be up to the defense bar, and it's gonna be up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| to the private attorneys and the judges to work that out. That's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| something that I have any access to or knowledge of. But I just wanted to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| you know that on behalf of the judges, they're 100% behind this. Will it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| used? Absolutely. They're trying to use it now. It's just the technology is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| such that it's creating all kinds of problems, and this would eliminate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2473)|
| 0:41:17| And I just want to say thank you to Tom Spangler for being willing to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| this forward because this is something that will definitely help the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| system not only now but in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| Thank you, Mr Hammond. Uh, Mr Ward, I think Clark Hammond answered most of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2487)|
| 0:41:33| questions. I was just looking Thio. I was looking to see what the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| were and what? How much? How many cases this would be affecting and how it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| would be affecting. So if you have any other data information on the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| hard numbers and such, I would be interested in seeing that either Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| Hammond or, um, Sheriff Spangler had that kind of data for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2509)|
| 0:41:55| I'll let the sheriff talk about that. You know, with 21,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| transported in 2019 again, you're looking at, you know, some things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| the Supreme Court would have to look at. I don't know what the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| would be in terms of, but let's say you could save 10%. That's 2000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| Let's say you do 20%. Uh, you know, you're looking at a lot of people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| you would not have to transport. Nobody wants to violate anybody's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| constitutional rights. If someone wants to be in court and the lawyer says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| Hey, I want my person brought to court. The judges are gonna do that. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| not gonna deny that. But if there's an opportunity for them to do some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| that could be done by video, and we're showing now that it's working, uh, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| there may be an opportunity to do that. But again, that's that's not my wheel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| house. Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2564)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh, Sheriff's finger got a question for you. Uh, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2570)|
| 0:42:57| many did you say that you could do it one time right now on this podcast or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| this casting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| Well, the courts have them in there outside their courtroom. So and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| with the mention, uh, Mr Hammond, you can correct me if I'm wrong, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| think each there's one for sessions. There's one for criminal courts, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| by time, if you will, to be able to get on there. That's exactly right. As it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| stands now, I think the sessions judges will use it first, and then they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| They'll come in, and then the criminal judges will use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2608)|
| 0:43:32| Well, this was this update. Sheriff's finger. How many can we do? If we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| the this plan, an additional six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| so you could do six where you're doing three at one time now, correct? That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| correct. So it'll be nine total. So you're doubling that. So it'd be it'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| be more efficient, and it would affect the safety also correct. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Safety and liability is another issue that we want to look at. Yes, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| correct. Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| Commissioner Hill. And then I'll get to Commissioner Smith. And then I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| another question myself. Pressure Hill. Yes, Sheriff Spangler. Just a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| of curiosity. Really? I, um, keep hearing about safety issues, safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2655)|
| 0:44:21| issues, and I certainly understand, um, that there's always a liability any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2661)|
| 0:44:26| time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| transportation is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| I have. Have there been significant safety issues in the past? I mean, has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| there been a lot of problems that we just don't know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| There's an officer safety issue every day. Commissioner, anytime that we deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| with transporting inmates or anything like that, there's always that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| first concern that we have to make. It's not saying that there's anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2688)|
| 0:44:53| wrong that the inmate does anything, but that factor goes up more trips. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| you make that factor goes up of being involved in a crash or anything else. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| those those are the other things that we're talking about. I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| But is that is that happening? I mean, are you are you having significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| safety issues or are you coping? Is it going well for you? I'm not having any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| safety issues, but that's not to say that he happened. That's why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| proactive with those things. But there again, this this benefits everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2721)|
| 0:45:26| It's not just it's not just us bringing people down there that that liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| and risk is something that we go through every day. Anytime that we deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| I hear you. But the way you were doing it right now and what you're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| right now, it sounds to me you feel very good about what your department is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2739)|
| 0:45:46| doing, and they are. They're more than adequately handling the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| Is that fair to say the safety part of that? Yes. You know, any time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| we're having to move somebody, we're always wondering what what could or go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| wrong. And that's what we're always prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Thank you, Mr Chair. Um, first question is for either Sheriff Spangler or Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| Hammond. Um, when you say 25 21,000 transports, is that for all types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2774)|
| 0:46:21| transports? Or is that just arraignments? Or is that also trials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| That number was given to me. That's total number. So that's everybody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| was taken from the detention facility and brought to the city accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| Okay. What would that number be for arraignments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| I don't know. I don't have that broken out. We have to go back for that. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| And, uh, Mr Hammond, you said that, uh, Judge Erwin was in favor of this. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| My understanding, though, is the facility is going to be out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| detention center, and maybe I'm missing something on technology. But how would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| that benefit him? Well, right now they're doing it anyway on Skype. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| so how would he be hooked into this system? Well, they would be able to hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| it up from his office. We would have a video camera in his office out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| juvenile facility, and so he would be able to access them directly from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2828)|
| 0:47:12| facility. Okay. And that is in in the plan in the budget. That would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2832)|
| 0:47:17| plan. Yes, we would be able to work that out to make sure that he had access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| it. Okay. I guess I'll dress the liability risk aspect of this. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2841)|
| 0:47:28| Sheriff Spangler is correct. We do not have terrible issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| transportation right now, but mitigating risk is always something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| where you look to what could happen. There are many things that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| happen a lot. But when they do happen, the cost associated with it is quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| high. And this this is a a fairly risky thing to transport people that far on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2865)|
| 0:47:55| daily basis. There is a certain level of risk that could be mitigated by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Thank you, Mr. Smith. Um, Sheriff Spangler or a member of your team, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2881)|
| 0:48:14| you have any more detail that you can provide? Perhaps? I don't know if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| for tonight, but maybe for next week for sure. Um, details kind of like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| talked about last month. You know, visuals, blueprints. How did they? You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| know, how did your team get to that number of of 1.5 million? Where will it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| be located? How many prisoners will be served? You know, how did they come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2913)|
| 0:48:38| with the $100,000 savings number? I mean, right now we we just have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| simple resolution that has virtually no details behind it. Is that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2923)|
| 0:48:48| is forthcoming to us to make a good and educated decision? It will be. It will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| be next week. We will present that to you. Okay, as soon as it's possible to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| get it to us, I would love to look into it. I'm certainly in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| adding opportunity for for technology and being proactive. I just I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| make it right now. We're kind of asking for getting asked for a blank check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| and I want to make sure we have plenty of information to understand it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| fully as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| Um, Mr. C, I have Commissioner Daly and then I have a hand up from Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| Jacobs. Commissioner Daly. Go ahead and let the mayor speak. I'll follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| with the question. Okay, Mayor Jacobs. I see your hand raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| Chairman is Chris Caldwell just to comment on on the 1.5 million. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2971)|
| 0:49:37| anticipate the cost to be that we wanted to put do not not to exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| number on on the resolution. So we only have to come once. We do have a term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| bid that we that we can use, and we're working through that. And so you'll get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| more details in. But we've got a term bid that we can use, and we wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2993)|
| 0:49:57| use a number not to exceed. We think the number probably is closer to like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| 1.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Chris, that was part of my question. How is the bid process working? Can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| fill us in on that? Yeah, so we've got it. We've got a term bid that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| use, and we will utilize that that term bid. It will enable the facility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| get built way we think in the May time frame. And so it does help to speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| things up by being able to use a term bid. Can you explain that term bid for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| some of our new commissioners and public at large? Sure. So oftentimes we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| will go out and put beds on the street for term bids for for for tears, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| not to exceed a certain amount or to exceed 500,000 to a million than over a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3047)|
| 0:50:53| million. And so we have construction companies to bid their services for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3053)|
| 0:51:00| those things. And and we review those those beds and then award based off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| that. Historically, they are awarded. We will work toe multiple companies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| just kind of rotate the services as we use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you very much, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| Commissioner Daly was before me. Oh, I think he got his answer. Did you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| your answer? Question? Question? Answer? Okay. Okay. I was just wondering if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| sheriff had an idea already what he was planning on doing with $100,000 in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| I don't know that I have anything in mind immediately with it, but obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| be used within within the correction side. I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| later pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| paying for the building over 15 years. Yes, Commissioner Hill. Um, just one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| more point of clarification. I heard, um, public defender Lutton speak to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| what what is allowed now? Um, as far as, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| these, um, remote hearings go and and you referenced some rulings, Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| Court rulings and and I don't know, even rulings below that. But I think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| would help the commission if we had some clarification as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| what what is and isn't allowed right now and where we might be if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3150)|
| 0:52:39| if these few changes aren't made. I mean, I would hate to. I'm not against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| this facility, just to be clear, but I would sure hate to build it and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| find out that that our Supreme Court or federal court or somebody comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| and says, Oh, no, you can't. You can't do this anymore. It's denying rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| or whoever, whatever they might say. So do you understand my my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| Commissioner Lutton or Defender Lutton? I think that I do. And I want to I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| to clarify a point from earlier. It was certainly not my intention. I hope I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| didn't say this. It was certainly not my intention to say that the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| would get no use post pandemic. I think that what Judge Irwin has laid out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| absolutely inappropriate usage under the law. And I don't think I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| that there's any issues there. I think that as the law currently stands, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| they would be able to conduct some arraignments and some initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| appearances. So I hope I wasn't taken to say that it would serve no value or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3212)|
| 0:53:39| use in the future. Just that I wanted to come before this body, um, to try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3219)|
| 0:53:45| lay out that if if individuals were looking at what is happening in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| court system now, um, that we're not gonna be able to just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| transition to a larger facility and just keep doing it that way. And, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| know, I reference I see that the 21,000 inmates transported in 2019. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| that that number goes to zero, you know, by any stretch of the imagination. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| mean, that number might might dip some, um, how much I don't really know. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| but to try and answer the specifics specifics of your question, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| Hill, there is a Supreme Court order. We actually just got another one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Friday. Um, but it lays out that essentially the rules of criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| procedure are suspended. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| so that way we can conduct things remotely. So right now, almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| everything is happening remotely. Uh, just basically with with the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| of just about preliminary hearings. Um, pretty much everything else is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| occurring remotely right now. And it is. I mean, it is a mess. It's a struggle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| right now for all of us. Um, you know, I am certainly not suggesting. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| if if we, you know, if we were gonna build the facility, if we could snap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| our fingers and it be here tomorrow, it would get used tomorrow. I absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| agree with that. I think that what I wanted to make this this body aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| though, was that once we get past the pandemic, unless there is some change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| in law, and maybe there will be, I don't know, it's not gonna get used like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| it's like we're currently doing remote court. It would that would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| permissible. Um, so, you know, sentencing's would be happening in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| person. Violations probation hearings would be happening in person any any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| time where there's any sort of evidence potentially being taken or, um, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| know, under the Constitution, people have the right to confront their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| accusers essentially. And so right now, I don't know what's gonna come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3322)|
| 0:55:27| this pandemic. Um, in terms of I imagine that we'll probably see some some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| collateral challenges to convictions. You know, people saying, Hey, my rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| were violated because I wasn't permitted to come and be physically present in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| court. I have no idea how that's gonna play out. I mean, there's this is so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| unprecedented that I think that it's, you know, it's probably rocked all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3342)|

| 0:55:49| little bit, and I think that it's a credit to Knox County. Um, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| stakeholders we've been working very well together, and I think that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| cobbled together what what we can. Um, but I just wanted to make this body to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| be aware from my perspective, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| that going out of the future post pandemic that it's it's gonna be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| restricted to what can and can cannot be done in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| Thank you. And I understand nobody can say for certain. And just one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| clarification. Um, when when we talk about Judge Irwin using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| he is our juvenile court judge. His all of his, um, uh, clients, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3388)|
| 0:56:38| are incarcerated at the detention facilities, which is where he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| physically located. Is that not correct? No. For for Judge Irwin's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| he also he's the juvenile court judge, but he also has jurisdiction over child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| support matters. And so individuals that are incarcerated for non payment of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| child support, um, and Mike, correct me if I'm getting this wrong, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| believe that that's what Judge Irwin was was talking about was the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| that are incarcerated for non payment of child support. He's been conducting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| those hearings. His magistrate's been conducting those hearings remotely and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| would be able to continue to do so. That's correct. Yes. All right. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| you. Thank you for that clarification. Commissioner Ward. Thank you. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| cleared up what I was asking. I was wondering if the Judge Irwin would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| able to use it for juvenile cases being in a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3443)|
| 0:57:29| Thank you for the clarification. Commissioner Ward. I had a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| Mr Codwell. Um, is there any federal dollars considering this is somewhat due| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| the pandemic and it's remote and everything else? Are there any federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| dollars or grants that we can apply for or look for to fund this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3460)|
| 0:57:47| Uh, in such short order, probably pretty hard. Uh, I could, uh, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| sheriff could speak to that more than I. They look for all all grants that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| out there that are possible to apply for. And we have not discussed any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| debt that would fit this mold in the shorter time frame. Okay. And just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| general comment for the sheriff. Me personally, I'd like to see our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| correction officers get a raise. If we have an extra $100,000, I would hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| that it would go and find its way towards them. Just a personal opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| though. Nothing else than that. If I had $1.5 million, that's where it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Thank you, Mr Chair. Uh, I guess this is for Mr Hammond, Sheriff Spangler or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3508)|

| 0:58:36| When you say Supreme Court, you're talking about the state's Supreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Court. I'm pursuing right here. Just shake your head. Yes. Has there been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| any other states outside Supreme Court of the United States saying that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| could do this or other states doing this other courts doing this or other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| police departments doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| Even as far as remote arrangements? Yes. Yes. Yes. Most as I Eric, correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| if I'm wrong, but I believe most states are allowing this. Uh, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| having most states because of the pandemic. They're having to do a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| what we're doing. Yeah, but is that something that weird that Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3551)|
| 0:59:17| not doing that started doing while other states have already out in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| of us doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| So I believe that I guess can ask a clarifying question. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| Daly, are you talking about during the pandemic? Are you talking about outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| of the pandemic? Well, I'm talking outside the pandemic. Say let's take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3571)|
| 0:59:36| Georgia, for instance. Georgia's laws are basically state laws. Maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| little bit different than ours. Are they allowing this video court in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| state, Georgia, Alabama, wherever? And we're just behind times and trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3585)|
| 0:59:49| catch up. I can't speak intelligently on what I've never practiced law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| outside of the state of Tennessee. And so I don't know what how the rules are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| written. The rules are criminal procedure in other jurisdictions. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| can tell you that there are some United States Supreme Court cases, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| specific to plea agreements, for example, uh, that that's United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3606)|
| 1:00:10| Supreme Court. I'm sorry, not United States Supreme Court, but federal court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| decisions that basically say that, um, the right to be present in person for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| plea hearing, um, is is wrapped up in the Constitution. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3617)|
| 1:00:25| I don't know that that fully answers your question because we have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| a lot of hearings that aren't necessarily just change of plea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| hearings, although I will point out that in the high 90% of cases do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| resolve by plea agreement in Knox County. Well, same time. I'll send an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| email to all three of you and try to explain myself a little bit better. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3637)|
| 1:00:42| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Okay. Seeing no further discussion or hands raised, Commissioner Biggs, I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| yours. Never mind. Thank you, Chairman. So basically from the talks that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| had from my fellow commissioners as well as the stakeholders, it looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3655)|
| 1:01:02| um, there's still gonna be an opportunity for lawyers to be in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| requesting in person. There's still gonna be that option because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| inmates right for due process is kind of what was explained by Defender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3671)|
| 1:01:15| Lutton. Um, Commissioner Hill pointed out about the security and incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| that may be there, and there's not really been an incident yet because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| we're being proactive and specific things. But one of the things that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3685)|
| 1:01:29| haven't seen yet, um, is talked about the number of prisoners basically pre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| Cove it as to what we have now, how many we've let go and things of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| nature. And are we expecting an uptick after Cove it on bringing more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| prisoners back into into our detention facility as well as how many are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3705)|
| 1:01:51| going to have to hire basically jobs for more security at the facility if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3711)|
| 1:01:58| we build on an extra, um, room for this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3718)|
| 1:02:06| Let me address the one part as far as hiring more personnel. We won't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| any more personnel because the people that we're we have here downtown at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| courthouse that are in the courts when that course not going on, then we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| have those officers at the facility handling those courtrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| So if an in person, uh, basically a lawyer's one in person will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| somebody out at the detention facility and downtown or with somebody request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| the in person, will there still be kind of two courtrooms going on at the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| time? So they'll just do a portion of in person and then the next day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| virtual. Or can you explain that a little bit better? That'll be up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| judges and how they do that, Commissioner. I'm not sure what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| will do, but, uh, the rooms that will be at the facility in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| will also have a room for attorneys to be able to talk to their clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3774)|
| 1:03:03| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. And thank you, Sheriff. Is there any further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| discussion before we move forward? We have a recommendation with a vote. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| would just like the data of how many prisoners we've released through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| code. If there's any way I could get that, I really appreciate it. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Chairman. And if I might, Commissioner J. Um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| Commissioner Biggs, were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| I'm thinking what I was hearing in between all that is like if we've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| nine courtrooms going on instead of three courtrooms, is that going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| require more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| law enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Uh, uh, Sheriff Spangler is. How does that work? I just answered that. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| what I'm saying that if the courtrooms are not being used here at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| county building and they're zooming out at the detention facility and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| officers that would normally be here at the courthouse will be out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| detention facility. All right. So when we're having court out there, we won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| be having it at city county building. No, there still be some there, but each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| courtroom has an officer for it. So you're not taken away from whenever one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| is out at the facility. You're not taken away from one from here at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| I think by the sentiments, Sheriff, if you and your team, everyone is hungry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| for more data, more visuals, more information, and I'm sure that you will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| provide those to us before we move forward next week. So currently we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| a motion on the floor by Commissioner Daly to or I believe by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=3887)|

| 1:11:13| if you or a member of your team wanted to talk about the change in this and the overlap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| in services. The overlap in services has to do with just an extension with Securus because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| once this bid was awarded to another company, then they agreed to carry on until the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4286)|

| 1:11:36| This this bid was up for bid this year, and that's the reason we put it out. I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4296)|

| 1:11:46| And so we put it out. We had some issues, but we wanted to also see if there was anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| else out there. What we've also learned during the bid process, too, is that there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4312)|
| 1:11:58| even a more savings on some of the items that we were not getting from the from Securus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4318)|
| 1:12:05| We will be bringing in more money for the general fund, obviously. And so that's where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4325)|
| 1:12:13| we are right now. OK, thank you for the clarification. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4333)|

| 1:12:26| just now that it would be savings and more money for the Sheriff's Department. What is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| the cost to the inmate using the service compared to the previous vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4351)|
| 1:12:40| It'll be the same cost, but there's other entities that they will pay us that we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4360)|

| 1:13:03| something that we didn't get from the last company. Thank you. Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4383)|

| 1:13:29| those back with them when the contract expires? We retained 300 of those. And then plus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4409)|

| 1:22:19| and then you're asking us to allocate $325,000 for the software? The software will actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4939)|

| 1:22:37| It is all federal treasury funds. Okay. Is there additional discussion, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| Yes, thank you, Chair. Jeannie, will this software be used after this $14 million has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| gone away? Is this something that we can use in the future? We would love to be able to use this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| in the future. It's a pretty impressive software system. I don't know, honestly, that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| this level of funding in the future. This is kind of a much bigger pot of money than what we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| typically allocated, so I don't know that we can afford to continue it past this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| but if we could, we would love to do that. Commissioner Smith? Go ahead and let Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=4992)|

| 1:23:34| It is. So out of that $325,000, the actual base price for the product is $235,000. There's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5014)|

| 1:24:03| additional amount, they are going to customize this application for us. And then the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| $60,000, that is an up-to amount for each of these applications that they process. They| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5049)|

| 1:24:37| about $0.84. Since we don't know how many applications that we're going to get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| this program, I just figured on the high side, I really don't think it's going to come all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5082)|
| 1:24:46| up to the $325,000, but I didn't want to under bet it and then end up being short on the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| of applications we need. Okay. And I was very pleased to hear that our Knox County IT Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5092)|

| 1:28:00| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| I make a substitute motion to move forward with that recommendation to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5282)|
| 1:28:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Okay, that was a substitute motion to move forward with that recommendation by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| Smith with a second by Commissioner, I didn't hear, Skomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| Okay, so open up the discussion on the substitute motion or the topic in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5300)|
| 1:28:29| Would anybody like more information on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5309)|
| 1:28:33| Commissioner Daley or Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| I saw you about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Go ahead, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Thank you, Mr. Former Chairman and Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| I guess we want to hear from Dr. Buchanan the process and then I looked at this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5325)|
| 1:28:52| This contract is like 140 pages plus long, which is unbelievable, but I think it's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5332)|
| 1:28:58| sub-leased from Mundy Realty, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| So, if somebody can confirm that, that we're sub-leasing through Food City from Mundy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5342)|
| 1:29:09| Lum, or Mundy Realty and why is it 140 pages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| So, thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| I hope Mr. Myers, Matt Myers is on the call because procurement was responsible for negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| the terms of this contract and the contract that you have before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| So, if you have questions about the contract, I will defer those to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5371)|
| 1:29:37| Mr. Myers, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5379)|
| 1:29:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| Dr. Buchanan is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| We, you know, were asked to look for a facility to house a vaccination clinic on a much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| long-term basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| Commissioner Daley, I think the reason for your question about the 140-so pages is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5396)|
| 1:30:02| are obviously some sub-lessors in that and, you know, we needed to get all the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5402)|
| 1:30:10| together, not just, you know, one portion of it because it's all tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| So, you are correct that Mundy Realty owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| KVAT Foods is a sub-lessor and we will be a sub-lessee to KVAT in this agreement, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5421)|
| 1:30:30| you also approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| I think it is a great location after looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| You get off at I-640 and be right in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| So, Dr. Buchanan, what is the start date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| Because the contract's kind of confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| One says it sounds like it starts on August 31st and then the other one says it ends on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| August 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| So, I guess, Matt, clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| What is the actual start date and what is the actual end date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5461)|
| 1:31:01| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| What we're looking for is the commencement date and the commencement date is in pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| much every lease agreement that you all look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| We still have work to do inside of this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| We don't want the commencement date to begin today and us not take possession of it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5475)|
| 1:31:20| two weeks or three weeks or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| So, that date will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| We can come back to you and say, you know, we're hoping it starts on March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| That's our goal to get that going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| But I also don't want to start the rent before I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5492)|
| 1:31:36| And once we sign that commencement document, then our rent would start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| So, that's the reason why that date is blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| Are there any calls for remodel or are we going to the taxpayer going to be stuck with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5505)|
| 1:31:50| a leaky roof that we'll have to repair or just one of those that I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| So, I just want to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5517)|
| 1:31:57| They own the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| We are simply a sub lessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| They are doing some electrical work for the health department that we probably will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| They are trying to get some additional electrical outlets where I believe its registration would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5529)|
| 1:32:18| take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| Those will be minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Covered by operating, you know, through the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| We'll not come back to commission for any type of dollars at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| I apologize, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Is this going to be inside the building plus a drive-thru, Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| This will be a walk-in clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| We've really proven that that's an effective way to get people vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| We're able to put through as many people as they can put through in a drive-thru with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| fewer staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| If somebody absolutely can't get out of their car, we'll have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| People out in the parking lot who can call and say, you know, Mr. Smith really just can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| get out of his car, and we'll go out and vaccinate him in the parking lot if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| That's one of the nice things about this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| There's a place, a way for them to pull up at the sidewalk and at the entrance of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| building and just go out and vaccinate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| We've been able to, you know, with the amount of space that we have, adequately space people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| apart to keep them safe from exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| And really, again, put through as many people as you can in a drive-thru without worries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| about weather and with fewer staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| There is no doubt logistically that this location is ideal in its level parking lot, its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| accessibility, and it gives the health department a place to function 24 hours a day out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5631)|
| 1:33:59| Not that they'll function 24 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| They don't have to break down and set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5641)|
| 1:34:06| It's a good location for what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| Director Myers, you and I had a conversation today, and I want to make sure I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5650)|
| 1:34:16| this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| Monday owns the building, leases it to KVT Food Stores, which is better known as Food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5658)|
| 1:34:27| City, who occupied the building on a term lease and built a new building and vacated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| but they're still bound by that term lease that they're in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5675)|
| 1:34:40| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| So we are a subtenant to Food City?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| I would like very much for you to go to Food City and tell them, I guess, about the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5688)|
| 1:34:56| you and I had today about corporate community partnership and how Knox County is in a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5696)|
| 1:35:04| that we need help and how much they can help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5704)|
| 1:35:12| If you would, please, sir, do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Commissioner Smith, I have already sent a very pointed email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| I actually got a phone call after that email from one of the gentlemen that we had been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| negotiating with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| He understands the county's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| He understands, you know, kind of where the situation is at that point, and he assured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| me that he would send it up the chain of command within KVT Food Stores in Abington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5738)|
| 1:35:47| So I looked to hear from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| I actually sent them the link to the meeting tonight, hoping they would join us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5749)|
| 1:35:55| I do not see any of the names on the list, but I did send them the link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5755)|
| 1:36:01| So I will report back next week if and when I hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5761)|
| 1:36:07| Okay, and Mr. Myers, I want to make it clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| I'm not looking to chill this lease or this arrangement in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| We need this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| What I'm looking for is a corporate partner that's willing to be there for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5775)|
| 1:36:20| in Knox County's time of need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Understand completely, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| I asked this question privately, but I wanted to ask it publicly for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| Did we explore all options in looking at the Knoxville Coliseum and the auditorium there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5793)|
| 1:36:41| to use for free in the parking across the street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| And could you please explain to the public why we did not decide to go with that option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| Sure, I'll be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| We did look at all of the available city and county properties, none of which really are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| adequate to meet our needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| When we're talking about, especially when we're talking about 70 and 75 and older folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| the parking at the Coliseum is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| And if you've ever been in the Coliseum, it's not exactly ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| It's no criticism of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| It was grandfathered in, but it's really not really easily accessible for those who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| ambulation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| The Convention Center and other public buildings, again, we have parking issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5844)|
| 1:37:29| We also have issues with access for those who are handicapped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| Getting into the Convention Center for somebody who's elderly is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5856)|
| 1:37:44| Also, the other thing, especially the Convention Center, not so much the Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| but they have other events there, and we would have to move out and move back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| which is challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| So there's the challenge of access, but then there's the challenge for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| Just a little window into the planning of COVID-19 vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| So if we have a vaccine event today, we have to look forward and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| depending on which vaccine we're giving, we need to be able to give second doses around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| day 21 or day 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5895)|
| 1:38:17| So we need to know that that facility is going to be available day 21 or 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| And we've run into that problem at the Expo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| We could run into that problem at other places that are going to start having events again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| or are having events again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5909)|
| 1:38:30| So this really is a unique space that meets our needs, and we did really fully vet all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5910)|
| 1:38:37| other options that would have maybe been free or cheaper and really did not find them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5917)|
| 1:38:43| meet the needs that we have for access for those who are older or maybe have disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| Now that, in theory, this passes, we'll have this new facility, we now have our waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| list, which I think is great that we got the waiting list situated and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| Are we able, as a county, to go to the state and say, hey, we've got X amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| on the waiting list, we have a facility to vaccinate these people, we can create a schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| can we have a dump of vaccines to hurry up the process, if you will, or advance the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5953)|
| 1:39:21| further since we are at a now facility and capability of processing through and vaccinating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| at a high level given this new facility and its operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| We certainly could ask the state for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| However, the state is allocating vaccine across the state based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| We continue to get, you know, slightly more vaccine each week, not a lot more, but slightly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| more vaccine each week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5986)|
| 1:39:48| And so, you know, that the state is using the database of population to allocate vaccine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5988)|
| 1:39:57| equitably across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| And I would not anticipate that they would say, sure, Knox County will give you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| more vaccine and we won't give vaccine to Anderson County or Sullivan County, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| can give you some vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I just don't see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| And another question, from my understanding, correct me, Ron, are we, the county aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| county health department, are we doing about 25% of all vaccinations within the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| Is that accurate or not accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Increase our capabilities given the new facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| Well, so we will continue to be able to offer vaccine on a regular basis for first and second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| We, I don't know that we'll see an increase in the percentage that the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| is doing, because in reality, if we get vaccine out into more places in the community, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| this facility, more people are going to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| There's some people, it doesn't matter where we are, there's some people who are not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| to come to a health department clinic to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| They're going to want to go to their local pharmacy that they're comfortable with or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| their doctor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| So I believe in increasing access across the spectrum, not just in one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| We are the only county who's really actively partnering with pharmacies and doctor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6068)|
| 1:41:14| offices to help the state determine how much vaccine they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| We're the only county who's doing events, not just in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| Most of the counties are doing just one location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| We're going into senior centers for those folks who maybe can't even go to the food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| city or into the African American community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| So I believe our approach of offering vaccine in lots of different locations, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6095)|
| 1:41:40| this one, really increases access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| So we just know that people are creatures of habit and may or may not come to a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| that maybe they're just not comfortable coming there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| So I want to offer vaccine in all the possibilities, all the possible locations we can so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| more people get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| Our partners are using the vaccine they get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| We are using all of the vaccine we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| And as that increases, we'll use as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| Right now, we're doing second or first dose vaccinations every day, every weekday, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| that will continue, just in a different location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| Are we able to tell the public what private partners we have so they can go to these other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6139)|
| 1:42:25| locations and try to utilize the private sector alongside with the public sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| Is there some knowledge area that we can direct people to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| The state just recently stood up their vaccination access or vaccination location page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6154)|
| 1:42:42| And on that page, which we'll link to from our website, you can go and you put in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| County, you can see all the different partners that are vaccinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| So we'll just link to that website so people, when they go to our website, can see those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6169)|
| 1:42:54| So that's out there and they can call to see vaccine availability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| Do we have currently, with our private partners, the ability to say, hey, you guys have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6178)|
| 1:43:05| or excess amounts of vaccines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| Can you take some of these people off our list and direct our people from our list that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| are most vulnerable to these private sector locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| Do we have that current capability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| So actually what's happening is that if a pharmacy or doctor's office or hospital is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6196)|
| 1:43:25| hosting a vaccine opportunity and they don't fill all of their appointments, they call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| us and we share information with them from our waitlist so then they can reach out to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| those folks and get them vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| It's a really great community partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6221)|
| 1:43:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| I'm trying to just wrap my mind around it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| So it looks like we reached out to Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| Food City basically said that it's a land lease through Monday realty and that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6234)|
| 1:44:02| to run us about $5,700 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| So per Commissioner Smith, we're reaching out to President Smith to see if there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6245)|
| 1:44:12| possibility of a better deal and through the state, I was trying to listen to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| Dr. Buchanan was talking about, but also did the state not just announce last week that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6257)|
| 1:44:24| they're going to open up to Walmart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| Basically, they were like awarded a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| Can you speak on that, Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6272)|
| 1:44:33| So the Walmart partnership is actually part of a federal partnership and so those vaccinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| will be coming not out of Knox County's allotment from the state, but out of a federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6280)|
| 1:44:45| allotment for those pharmacies in the federal partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6285)|
| 1:44:53| So that comes out of a different pot of vaccine, not out of our pot of vaccine through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6293)|
| 1:44:58| federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| And again, back to the idea that the more places vaccine is available, the more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| will get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| I welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| I look forward to them activating more pharmacies and larger pharmacies so that people can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6308)|
| 1:45:15| vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| So again, that's not coming out of our allotment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| That's coming out of a different allotment, which I'm happy for because my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6318)|
| 1:45:23| is they're standing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| I think they're potentially standing up several Walmarts in Knox County and they're able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6324)|
| 1:45:30| do several vaccinations a day, I believe seven days a week, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6330)|
| 1:45:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6336)|
| 1:45:36| And my second question is, is one of the things I was getting multiple emails about is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| way that the line is designed for the elderly so that they aren't out in the elements as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6341)|
| 1:45:48| long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6348)|
| 1:45:48| Is there any kind of schematic or anything we can see before next week to kind of show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| some of our constituents that this is not going to be as big of an issue as it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| have been prior?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| So I think everybody's going back to that first event that we had where it was a come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| one, come all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| We haven't had that line since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| What we what we're doing now is people are waiting in their car until their appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| time is available and then they're asked to line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| And so each 15 minutes, I won't say the numbers because I'll get them wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| I don't recall, but we have so many appointments every 15 to 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6378)|
| 1:46:22| And when your appointment time is up, we tell you it's up and you get in line and you only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| have to wait with, you know, 15 people or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6387)|
| 1:46:31| So we don't have people waiting outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| We can certainly try to get you schematic or the plan or even maybe some pictures from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| the clinic to show you what we're doing, because, again, it's kind of a combo drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6399)|
| 1:46:45| through walk in because we're having people wait in their car until it's time to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| in and get their vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| So really reduced wait times, but people are still getting through quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| So I'm pretty proud of my staff for coming up with that idea of, hey, why don't we let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6415)|
| 1:46:59| them wait in their car where it's nice and warm and then they can get up and get in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| and most of them are, I think, are probably waiting inside the building and not outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| It's just something to email back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| I appreciate your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| We were talking earlier about Food City and partnershiping with Food City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| Food City, we've been partnering with people in PAL and halls for community and food drives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6449)|
| 1:47:37| and all like this, and they've been doing real well for us in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6457)|
| 1:47:41| And they have been contributing and they have been helping out our areas, especially some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6461)|
| 1:47:47| of the churches that have the Super Bowl drive where they get cans of soup and send it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| some of these food banks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| They sell it at a real good price, a lot lower than we can get anyplace else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| So they have been posturing and helping communities out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| And to try to put pressure on them to do that when they're already doing things, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6485)|
| 1:48:13| going to hurt some other people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6493)|
| 1:48:15| They'll probably try to help as they can, but they've been helping out all along for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| years back out in our area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| The other thing about Walmart, Annette, I've got some information where they have 11 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| Walmarts in Shelby County that they've got lined up that's doing vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| And sometimes you can get that information from the state where they're partnering with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| those type individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| And even local pharmacies, little local pharmacies that are in Union County and in Granger County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6523)|
| 1:48:49| have been giving out vaccinations too and been doing a real good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| And again, if you want to find out, it's on the state website and they can tell you where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6532)|
| 1:48:58| they have these vaccinations in the small counties also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6538)|
| 1:49:02| So there's things out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| We just got to find out how we can get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| And what you can do is it's one of those things out in our area, people call you all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6547)|
| 1:49:12| saying, hey, did you know that you're getting ready to do this at this one location or this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| other location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| And the community really helps out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| So it's out there and I don't know how the community gets it so quick, but they get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6560)|
| 1:49:27| quicker than I've ever seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| And I get calls every day where they're giving out vaccinations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| So you just got to keep your ear to the ground and you can hear people that are helping each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6571)|
| 1:49:36| other out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| So again, be careful with my food city out there that helps us out there for drives for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6578)|
| 1:49:45| charities and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Thank you, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6593)|
| 1:49:56| Dr. Buchanan, this contract is, I think as Commissioner Daley pointed out, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6596)|
| 1:50:03| have a commission, a start date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| What is the anticipated and then after you answer that, I got a few more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6607)|
| 1:50:14| So Mr. Myers can chime in, but our anticipated start date is the first week of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6614)|
| 1:50:21| OK, and so that would that would put us at about two weeks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6621)|
| 1:50:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6626)|
| 1:50:27| OK, you're currently administering first doses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| What are we going to put in place to make sure people know that this will be the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| to go for their second dose and not back to, I assume, the expo center where most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6635)|
| 1:50:41| are getting it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6641)|
| 1:50:42| So actually, we're currently administering both first and second doses in a variety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| locations, but they will be notified via email or we'll call them to let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6646)|
| 1:50:55| We'll also put it on our social media pages, but they'll get reminders about their appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| and be reached and we'll reach out to them to let them know where to go for their second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6659)|
| 1:51:04| dose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| OK, and the funds for this, where do they come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6665)|
| 1:51:12| The funds for this are coming from the some of the COVID funding that we got, not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6672)|
| 1:51:18| CARES Act, but there was another allocation of funding that came through some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6678)|
| 1:51:25| laboratory prevention thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| It's some federal program that we get funding through and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| Kevin Parton, I believe, is on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6692)|
| 1:51:34| He may remember exactly what the funding is coming from, as he remembers those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6699)|
| 1:51:40| Kevin, do you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| If you could just identify yourself, Mr. Parton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6704)|
| 1:51:45| Kevin Parton, Knox County Health Department, 140 Davenport Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6705)|
| 1:51:50| We received ELC funding, epidemiology, laboratory capacity grant last July that came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| And that will be getting reimbursed for almost all of our COVID activities, be it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| OK, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Mr. Commissioner Smith brought up my question, but since this is the printing press out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6731)|
| 1:52:19| Washington that's going to be spending the money for this, we don't need to be asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| We don't need to be asking the food city to not take some of that money to further rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| I don't think that would be right, since this is federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| If it's Knox County dollars, I think it'd be a different story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6757)|
| 1:52:38| So let's use the federal dollars and take care of our own, as Commissioner Boesler says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| Dr. Buchanan, I just seen the email come through that we're going through 65 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6765)|
| 1:52:53| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6777)|
| 1:52:58| The state made that decision to move to 65 plus and 1B today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| They announced that, and to keep in line with, to be congruent with what we've done in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6783)|
| 1:53:09| past, we're going to move with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| That doesn't mean we finished all the 70 and older folks, nor does it mean we finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| all the 1A and 1B, 1A2 and 1A1 folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6797)|
| 1:53:22| But it just avoids confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Our constituents do not necessarily stay within the county lines, and folks from other counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| come here to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Folks from our county go there to get vaccinated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| Just to keep it congruent and equitable across county lines, we made the decision internally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6814)|
| 1:53:40| to move with the state when they move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| And so we're working right now to change the information on our website and on the wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| list so that those folks can sign up for the wait list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| Out of the, we're at what, 55,000, 60,000 vaccines now vaccinated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6838)|
| 1:53:58| We're at, I believe, 72,000, but I can go look at our website and tell you for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6838)|
| 1:54:05| But I think it's higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| I know it's a high number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| So my question is that 70 plus, or do you think we're at 50 percent vaccinated, 80 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| What do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| I don't, and I could look at the data, but I don't think we're, we are not that high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6856)|
| 1:54:21| on that percentage, that population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| We might be at a, have vaccinated about a third of those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6864)|
| 1:54:29| You know, we've only been vaccinating them for a couple of weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| And so I doubt, I would be hard pressed to say that we're at that high a level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6871)|
| 1:54:39| The numbers that we're getting, or I've been told we got 75 and over, is about 30, 35,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6885)|
| 1:54:45| Does that sound right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| And then you add, it's about 20,000 more people, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| And when you add in the 70 and older, again, that's off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| So let's see, 61 to 70, we've vaccinated about 11 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6896)|
| 1:55:02| 71 to 80, 28 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| This 65 number, does that, I don't have it in front of me, so I want to hopefully you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| remember, is that, is this the next group, teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| Is this part of the teachers going to be in this group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6919)|
| 1:55:19| The state also moved to 1B, which is teachers, child care providers, and actually parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6919)|
| 1:55:27| who care for disabled children at home as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6927)|
| 1:55:31| So what do we got on the waiting list now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| Do you know how many, what's the number, last I heard was 6,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| 9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6937)|
| 1:55:39| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6939)|
| 1:55:39| I think it's 9,000 now, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| I think that's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6941)|
| 1:55:43| Yeah, and then this will probably add another 10,000 to it, that's 65 plus, plus the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6943)|
| 1:55:49| which is, you know, the teachers, we got what, 3,000 personnel, I'm guessing, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6955)|
| 1:55:55| Actually, it's quite a bit higher than that when you add, so Knox County Schools alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| has about 9,000 staff, teachers and everybody included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| Then you add the private schools in there, daycares, our child care, and those, all those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6965)|
| 1:56:11| folks, it's quite, it's a large group, and we are actively working with our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6971)|
| 1:56:18| partners like the hospitals to have a coordinated effort to increase access to vaccine for teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6978)|
| 1:56:25| in the 65 and older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| We're actively working with schools for a plan on how to communicate through the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6987)|
| 1:56:33| about vaccine opportunities for teachers and not just the public schools, but the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Yeah, well, thank you, and my suggestion to the people that call me, you know, I try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| give them from the VA to their private doctors and everyone, but, you know, we can't vaccinate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| there's 7 million people in Tennessee where it'd be great if we had 7 million doses, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7011)|
| 1:56:56| we don't, we got to be patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| You know, I'm 61, so I'm standing in line, so thank you, and thank you to the health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7018)|
| 1:57:04| department for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7024)|
| 1:57:09| Dr., thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7029)|
| 1:57:11| Dr. Buchanan, I just wanted to clarify, the numbers and the data that you report on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| number of vaccinations, that's only for the health department of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| That does not, you're not recording or have any information of data from private, other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| private entities, other hospital groups, et cetera, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| Actually, no, we, so the state started reporting out vaccinations per, by county and providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| this with that data, so actually that 70,000 plus number that you see is a combination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| of what we've done and our community partners, there have been several small pharmacies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7061)|
| 1:57:48| activated and our hospitals continue to vaccinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| Okay, good, that's a new update, so that's great, and then also, can you just clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| for the public, you mentioned that some of our residents go other places and other residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7074)|
| 1:58:01| from other counties come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Could you just explain why, we've had this discussion before, but I think it's worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7083)|
| 1:58:07| repeating why it is that a Knox County resident can go somewhere else and why an Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| County or other resident can come here and why that is set up that way statewide or federally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| Sure, so the vaccine is a federal asset and it's purchased by the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7099)|
| 1:58:26| and so therefore it is for all people who live in the United States, it's not just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| Knox County, and so statewide we've made that decision, all of us are vaccinating people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| from other counties because we just want to get everybody vaccinated, and so it's open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| to anyone who lives in the United States to get vaccinated because the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| has paid for this vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| I'm going to call again on sort of final comments across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| I want to make sure we don't get too far off topic, although this is really good information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| about our vaccine program, we are actually voting on item number 38, so I want to sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| of move to the final comments on 38, and then we can continue other discussion beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7145)|
| 1:59:10| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| Just a clarifying question, we are working on a plan to vaccinate the teachers or we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7152)|
| 1:59:17| have a plan to vaccinate the teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7157)|
| 1:59:18| I couldn't hear that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| So we are working to gather information to be able to vaccinate the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7161)|
| 1:59:27| Teachers can go once now that they've been activated, they can go to any clinic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7167)|
| 1:59:32| is available and open, but we're coordinating with our hospital partners to have a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7172)|
| 1:59:39| effort to get teachers vaccinated, as well as those over 65 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| But we'll be focusing on teachers and working on gathering information to move that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7185)|
| 1:59:53| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7193)|
| 1:59:54| The short answer is we're working on a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Dr. Buchanan, do you have all the money you need to take care of all the people you need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| to get us through this pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7206)|
| 2:00:10| Honestly, I would say, Commissioner Smith, that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7210)|
| 2:00:14| I mean, we got a very large amount of money from the federal government through the ELC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7214)|
| 2:00:21| grant, and we're being very judicious about how we use that, but we're funding the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| that we need to fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| And we're also, you know, moving staff around to better serve the current needs of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7228)|
| 2:00:34| response, which are mostly vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| So I feel like we do have adequate funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| Kevin's our finance guy, so he would probably say we always need more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7239)|
| 2:00:44| We could certainly, we would put more money to use, but I feel like we're adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| Okay, and that's kind of, and I'm not trying to knock food city, but that's kind of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| I'm thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| I'd rather spend money on people than building, and we don't know how long this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7256)|

| 2:06:44| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker? Thank you, Chairman Jay. Cindy, to start with, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7604)|
| 2:06:50| old is the Carter Park? I believe Carter Park goes back probably to the 1980s. I tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7610)|
| 2:07:01| to research it early on, but I can't remember for sure, but I want to say it was the 1980s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7621)|
| 2:07:11| And then this allocation is only for design services. There is no construction costs involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7631)|
| 2:07:21| in it. This is just for? This is strictly for the design purposes. It will take care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7641)|
| 2:07:28| of the surveying and design for everything that's on the site. Basically, Carter Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7648)|
| 2:07:34| is 30-some acres and has a lot of facilities out here, including we've got a library and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| senior center in property. I just lost the picture there. And then you also have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7661)|
| 2:07:53| baseball fields, three softball fields, a soccer field, batting cages, a pavilion, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7673)|
| 2:08:02| playground, a basketball court, concession stands, restroom buildings, and three-tenths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7682)|
| 2:08:08| of a mile of a walking trail. Okay. And I noticed in the documents that were submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7688)|
| 2:08:15| with our agenda that the original architectural report was dated May of 2018. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7695)|
| 2:08:23| survey. Go ahead. Oh, no. You finish your train of thought and I'll fill you in. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7703)|
| 2:08:32| And then the draft report was done in February of 2019. So here we are two years later. Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| any of that information still relevant? The information is still relevant, but as part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7719)|
| 2:08:46| of this contract, they're going to go back out and reassess the situation to see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7726)|
| 2:08:51| else may have changed since they did the original transition plan. Okay. So basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7731)|
| 2:08:59| we're kind of paying twice for because of the lack of time? They have access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7739)|
| 2:09:07| information from the last time, but the key to it is they're going to go out and see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7747)|
| 2:09:11| anything else has happened since they did that last assessment for that for the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7751)|
| 2:09:18| plan. Okay. And it says in the contract that they're going to, uh, they referenced the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| 2010 ADA standards and it's kind of my understanding. Oh, go ahead. I'm sorry. No, the 2010 standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7764)|
| 2:09:33| is the current ADA standard to go by. Well, it's been my understanding that the ADA standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7773)|
| 2:09:41| seem to be kind of a moving target. Uh, as an example, we just finished a, um, a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7781)|
| 2:09:47| Karnes Senior Center about three and a half, four years ago. And that was built up a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| that was, uh, done to the current ADA standards. But if we went out there today, there's about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7793)|
| 2:10:00| 14 to 16 items that are not current. So if we're going back to something that's 10 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7800)|
| 2:10:08| old standards, you know, are we better to wait until they come out with the 2020 standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7808)|
| 2:10:16| Do you see where I'm going with this? Well, the problem is things that have been built since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7816)|
| 2:10:22| uh, 2010 and even before that, because ADA has been around to be 31 years this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| Uh, the problem is we have continued to build things that are not ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7829)|
| 2:10:34| So some of the things like even as recent as the Karnes Center should have been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| correctly, but weren't. And we're going back and trying to get those adjusted as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7839)|
| 2:10:48| Okay. And then did, do I remember from a previous analysis that we have about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| what is it, about $48 million that we needed to spend to upgrade all of our facilities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7855)|
| 2:11:01| ADA standards? I think it's double almost, isn't it? Or $78 million something? Yes, it's more like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| $80 million over 40 years. Yes. But we are trying to, uh, systematically go at it in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7867)|
| 2:11:16| things that can be done through a maintenance program, that those are moving forward. Uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| this particular project is, is a very good project because it hits on several items in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7882)|
| 2:11:30| you've got the library, you've got the senior center, you've got the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| And my understanding that the schools even use the ball fields out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7893)|
| 2:11:39| So we'd be getting a lot of bang for the buck on this one. Okay. And so once we pay for the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7899)|
| 2:11:45| standards, do you understand, do you have an idea of what the expected cost will be to bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7905)|
| 2:11:52| to ADA standards? As part of the design process, the engineer will give an opinion of the probable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7912)|
| 2:11:59| construction cost that is included in this contract. But you don't have a rough guess now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7919)|
| 2:12:07| Not right now, no. Okay. Uh, thank you. You're welcome. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7927)|
| 2:12:16| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Cindy, follow up on John's question. To Claire, did we pay in 2018 and 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7936)|
| 2:12:26| this consultant any money? Yes, sir. This firm actually did our original transition plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7946)|
| 2:12:34| that we went through an RFP process, just like we did for this project. And I want to say the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7954)|
| 2:12:41| contract at that point was about $1.1 million. And they assessed all of the county maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7961)|
| 2:12:47| facilities. And that includes, as you know, quite a few. There were like, at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7967)|
| 2:12:54| 86 schools were evaluated, 47 parks, six senior centers. I want to say there was about 15 PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7974)|
| 2:13:04| managed facilities that were looked at, 18 public libraries, about 86, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7984)|
| 2:13:14| uh, signalized traffic signals. Uh, there was probably about 140 miles of sidewalks that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=7994)|
| 2:13:21| evaluated. And there were another 1300, some un-signalized driveways and intersections that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8001)|
| 2:13:30| were looked at also. So it's quite a lengthy review of our facilities, what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8010)|
| 2:13:37| So this contract is another extra 200 and whatever it is to just do Carter Park. So when we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8017)|
| 2:13:46| IC King or Maloney Road Park or whatever, are we going to have to spend another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8026)|
| 2:13:52| two or $300,000 to the same engineering company to update it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| Uh, not necessarily. This is a, as I said, this is a very old park. And it had, this is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8037)|
| 2:14:07| based on the, it's a recreational park. And from the perspective, when we went out there to visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8047)|
| 2:14:13| it, uh, the Dagwood committee went out there and that's our disability advisory group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8053)|
| 2:14:18| went out there with, um, Shauna Godlefsky and I, uh, she's what was with Parks and Rec at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8058)|
| 2:14:25| And we went out and looked at the facility and it, it needs a lot of work in terms of what needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8065)|
| 2:14:32| happen. Uh, topographically, uh, one of our, uh, members on Dagwood actually gets around with an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8072)|
| 2:14:40| electric wheelchair and she had to put on her seat belt in her wheelchair to go from the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8080)|
| 2:14:49| up to the pavilion where the picnic tables were. Um, one of our other members who has MS, uh, she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8089)|
| 2:14:56| was getting around that day with her walker. She didn't even attempt to go up the grade to get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8096)|
| 2:15:02| the picnic pavilion because she was very worried that she was going to fall coming back down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| grade. So, um, like I said, this park just has a lot of issues that we felt really needed a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8107)|
| 2:15:15| strong look at by somebody who's very, by a company that's very well known for dealing with ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| issues. And that the lessons that we learned from this one, we can carry over to our other parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| uh, facilities. Well, I'm sure I've been to the Carter Park and I understand, and I'm sure it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8127)|
| 2:15:33| needed, but I just don't want the taxpayers to be in twice, being paid, paying twice for a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8133)|
| 2:15:41| And I hope you understand what I, when I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| Well, the study identified the, the previous plan identified where the problems were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8145)|
| 2:15:50| This is actually going to provide the design for how to fix those problems that were found before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8150)|
| 2:15:57| And that's what the difference is. Uh, part of the problem is across the board on all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8157)|
| 2:16:03| parks facilities, uh, the findings from the previous study were that in addition to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8163)|
| 2:16:09| parking lots, not being accessible, there were no accessible routes from not only the parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8169)|
| 2:16:16| to the different functions that you can get to at the park, but between functions at the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8176)|
| 2:16:21| like you couldn't get from say the picnic tables to the playground. Uh, you actually had to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| across the ground. There was no sidewalk or pathway or anything. And so I have no idea if one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8187)|
| 2:16:35| recommendations that comes out of this in terms of their design that they come up with, that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| going to recommend, like maybe even relocating where the playground is, uh, from its current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8200)|
| 2:16:46| facility, or if they're just going to recommend installing a sidewalk that is actually ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8206)|
| 2:16:51| compliant. Okay. Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Hello, Cindy. I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8211)|
| 2:17:00| to try to get some background into this to try to make it a little more understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8220)|
| 2:17:07| The federal government required us to put together a ADA transition plan. When we were doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| process, we signed a contract with this company to get us an overall assessment to put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8234)|
| 2:17:23| this 40-year plan. Part of the ADA compliance is you have to make progress towards that 40-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8243)|
| 2:17:32| plan. I'm assuming this is the first step, and we've chose this property because of its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8252)|
| 2:17:39| deficiencies. So now the company comes back and looks at in fine detail at what needs to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8259)|
| 2:17:47| place, whereas the overall assessment was more of a general broad-range plan. This is a more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8267)|
| 2:17:55| defined, this is what is going to be required to become compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8275)|
| 2:18:01| That's, you, you stated that very well, and you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8281)|
| 2:18:11| Okay. Thank you for the clarification on that. Is there any other comments or discussion on item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8291)|
| 2:18:19| number 46? Thank you, Ms. Pianchi. Seeing none, the motion is to approve by Commissioner Beeler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8299)|

| 2:19:34| Okay, on page 8, item number 48 is a resolution requesting that the members of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8374)|
| 2:19:44| General Assembly representing Knox County introduce and seek passage of a legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8384)|
| 2:19:49| bill regarding state and local tax revenue allocations for a mixed-use stadium in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| County. This is resolution 903. I'll make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8396)|
| 2:20:04| Thank you. Second, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| Second by Commissioner Beeler. I just want to introduce this really quickly. As you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8408)|
| 2:20:14| see in the resolution, this is basically a statement of encouragement to our state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8414)|
| 2:20:21| When we had our state delegation meeting just a couple weeks ago, one of the topics was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8421)|
| 2:20:27| legislation around proposed stadium and how the state must pass a piece of legislation to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8427)|
| 2:20:36| allow for the collection of taxes in a certain zone as it relates to the overall plan for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8436)|
| 2:20:42| stadium. And the head of our delegation, Senator Massey, asked if it would be helpful if we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8442)|
| 2:20:48| pass a resolution in support of their efforts to pass such a legislation. This is, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8448)|
| 2:20:54| one piece of a much larger discussion, but you have the resolution before you, and it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8454)|
| 2:20:59| essentially a statement from us as the legislative body of Knox County encouraging them to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| forward on that and give us another tool to be able to consider a future downtown stadium. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8465)|
| 2:21:12| that is essentially the overall view, and I'll open it up for discussion with Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8472)|
| 2:21:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair. If this passes unanimous, I think we ought to have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| as a commission resolution as a whole body. I think it would look better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8484)|
| 2:21:31| Okay. Would everybody like to sign on to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8491)|
| 2:21:35| Just raise your hand if you would like to add your name as a commission. I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| That's a good point, Commissioner Daley. Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the resolution, how did we end up deciding that it would just be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8503)|
| 2:21:50| quarter mile from the center point of the stadium as opposed to a third of a mile or a half a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8510)|
| 2:21:57| or three quarters of a mile? Perhaps Chris Caldwell could answer that, but I'm pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8517)|
| 2:22:03| sure the answer is that matches what the legislative, what the legislation on a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8523)|
| 2:22:10| level allows and is sort of a precedence for other similar projects. But Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| is that an accurate statement? And Mamentoff is on here, too, and he can speak to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| He helped to write that, so I'll just defer to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| Mr. Mamentoff, if you could identify yourself and name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| Yes, my name is Mark Mamentoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| The quarter mile is not in the legislation. This is something that we spent quite a bit of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8556)|
| 2:22:44| talking about. If you go much beyond the quarter mile, it'll start overlapping with the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8564)|
| 2:22:50| and will conflict with the TDZ, already the existing incremental sales tax district that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8570)|
| 2:22:56| in effect for another seven or eight years. We felt that we would stand the best chance of success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| if we tried to avoid that overlap to the maximum extent possible. The quarter mile picked up all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| Mr. Boyd's proposed $140 million development immediately surrounding the stadium and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8587)|
| 2:23:12| very nice developable, I can say that word, lots around the stadium as well. And these types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8592)|
| 2:23:22| sales tax districts are always a challenge with the legislature, and obviously we would very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| gratefully appreciate your all support to encourage our legislation. They've been great working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| us, but we felt like that was a very realistic goal and that way, if we went much beyond it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| that we might get more pushback from the state. And this was based on input that we just received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8617)|
| 2:23:42| from folks that were knowledgeable in that area. So the feedback as to the size from folks in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8622)|
| 2:23:48| Nashville, but also as to not trying to overlap with the existing TDZ was the thinking behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| that quarter mile radius. Okay, thank you very much. Sure. Mr. Chairman, can I have a follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8633)|
| 2:24:02| question? Yes, sir. Mr. Mark? Yes. What is the center point? Is it going to be home plate or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| pitcher's mound? Center of the stadium, actually, I guess it's right behind. That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8648)|

| 2:24:21| Mr. Boyd's, Doug Kirchhofer assured me that that can be accurately located and can sort of be like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8661)|
| 2:24:30| the fixed point from which we would measure. And if we have other things like soccer or lacrosse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8670)|
| 2:24:37| or things, we may move home plate or the pitching mounds. We tried to pick something that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8677)|
| 2:24:42| ever going to be moved, so it went from that. Thank you, Commissioner Daly. Madam Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8682)|

| 2:27:43| Uh, thank you, Chairman Jay. I was wondering if Chris Caldwell just wanted to give us a quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8863)|
| 2:27:48| overview of this. Thank you, Commissioner. This is a just budget revisions that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8868)|
| 2:27:56| monthly. We're going to bring these to you at least quarterly, and they just kind of show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8876)|
| 2:28:03| what they are. So if you look under the general fund, it would be things that's related to like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8883)|
| 2:28:08| forfeitures in the sheriff's office. So instead of bringing those every month, we have found a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8888)|
| 2:28:13| to bring those at least quarterly. And so there are amendments that happen throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8893)|
| 2:28:20| and we want to bring them more regularly. Okay, and then on the adopted budget for the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8900)|
| 2:28:28| fund, the second one, the designation of the 5.2 million, that is what we approved this past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8908)|
| 2:28:33| summer. Is that correct? That is correct. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8913)|
| 2:28:42| Is there any further discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, would you please call the vote on item number 50?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8926)|

| 2:29:39| I just wanted to make sure. On the light items, budget amendments. Budget amendments. Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8979)|
| 2:29:44| So that'll move to consent for next week. Okay. Thank you very much. Next item, I think our final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8984)|
| 2:29:51| item, Madam Clerk. Item number 51. It's a, well, it says here at the BOC. Yeah, that'll be next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8991)|
| 2:29:58| We had the discussion item. I can add it. I can introduce it. Okay. It was a discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=8998)|
| 2:30:11| about future commission meetings. Oh, yeah. Okay. And I don't, there's not really a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9011)|
| 2:30:19| This is our last item of business for the night. And I just wanted to bring this up tonight after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9019)|
| 2:30:24| our discussion this afternoon in the Rules Committee. And I wanted to get some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9024)|
| 2:30:30| and comments from each of you all. If you remember, I think it was several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9030)|
| 2:30:36| maybe it was a week or two ago, I sent out a letter to all of you all, basically outlining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| that this month's meetings would stay in a virtual environment, but that all indications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9042)|
| 2:30:48| are that our numbers are, COVID numbers are continuing to decrease while our vaccinations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9048)|
| 2:30:54| are continuing to increase. And that I felt like if things were moving back to, or continuing on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9054)|
| 2:31:02| that trend, that we would, I would plan to move back into in-person meetings beginning in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9062)|
| 2:31:08| and sort of indicated to that. We had a pretty robust discussion and a good starting point today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9068)|
| 2:31:15| in our Rules Committee about the role and responsibility of the chair and the vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9075)|
| 2:31:20| And I'm, although I'm still a bit confused, essentially was, you know, recommended by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9080)|
| 2:31:28| law director that this really is not for, this is a vote for the whole committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9088)|
| 2:31:35| or the whole commission, and not just for the chair. And although I'm still confused about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9095)|
| 2:31:42| how a committee chair can make certain decisions, and the regular chair of the whole commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9102)|
| 2:31:48| and there's still lots to be decided upon or discussed, essentially was, it was recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| by our law director that I bring this up tonight, talk to you all about it, and that going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9114)|
| 2:32:00| all determinations of how we should have a meeting should actually be per vote by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9120)|
| 2:32:08| commission as a whole. And we went through many scenarios about what happens if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9128)|
| 2:32:17| the sprinkler system breaks and the whole place floods in the city county building, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9137)|
| 2:32:22| what do we do? And my understanding is the direction of the law department is that for any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| such meeting decisions like that, if you have to call a special called meeting just to decide on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9148)|
| 2:32:34| the next meeting, then it has to be a vote of the whole commission. So I just bring the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9154)|
| 2:32:40| up to one to sort of reiterate my intent, but also to get feedback and try to get some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9160)|
| 2:32:47| clarification as to who is supposed to make what decision, because it is still very confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9167)|
| 2:32:55| and at some point, we needed to collectively decide which way to go and how should we handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9175)|
| 2:33:01| this going forward. So all that to tee up anybody who would like to jump in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9181)|
| 2:33:08| and one of our former chairmen has raised his hand first, and that is Commissioner Smith. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9188)|
| 2:33:13| I'll open the floor to Commissioner Smith and begin this discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9193)|
| 2:33:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair. In normal times, this is a pretty straightforward question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9197)|
| 2:33:23| Our rules state very clearly that our meetings are set out on dates and times as predetermined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9203)|
| 2:33:32| by the agenda we set, with the only exception being if a meeting falls on a legal holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9212)|
| 2:33:41| discretion is given to the chair at that point. As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9221)|
| 2:33:48| in-person Zoom meetings, I don't really think our rules address that aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9228)|
| 2:34:02| I think it does address the times, the dates, those things, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9242)|
| 2:34:12| That's the discussion. Any event that falls on a legal holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9252)|
| 2:34:15| the chair shall convene the commission on a date and time set by the chair. That's a legal holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9255)|
| 2:34:23| The rest of these are predetermined when it seems like we vote on our schedule every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9263)|
| 2:34:29| We don't vote on our schedule every year. That's what you've gotten to is the main crux of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9269)|
| 2:34:34| There is more description of what a committee chair does in our rules than what a chair of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9274)|
| 2:34:40| the commission does. And I am hoping to seek to clarify those roles and responsibilities for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9280)|
| 2:34:46| future chairs. But what you've just gotten to is a perfect example of it says nothing about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9286)|
| 2:34:51| natural disasters. Perhaps, let's say, there was a bomb threat in the building. The sprinkler system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9291)|
| 2:34:58| went off and it was flooded. There was some sort of other natural disaster. There is nothing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9298)|
| 2:35:04| to say who makes the determination of where do we meet and how do we meet. And that certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9304)|
| 2:35:10| comes down to the earlier conversation and the disagreements amongst commission back in December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9310)|
| 2:35:16| of do we meet in person or do we meet virtually. So there's nothing that addresses the abnormal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9316)|
| 2:35:21| times. And that is the crux of where we are today and why I wanted to bring this up going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9321)|
| 2:35:30| Okay. So would that fall into the terms of like a special meeting? Because it's not a normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9330)|
| 2:35:38| meeting if it's going to be virtual. And it seems that the way we've always done that is to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9338)|
| 2:35:48| the chairman suggests something and it is voted on in the commission forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9348)|
| 2:35:54| Yeah. There's just nothing written down that shows the precedence. And to just go back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9354)|
| 2:36:01| forth a little bit on this before calling in others, this is sort of the codifying of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9361)|
| 2:36:07| has been versus tradition versus what is. That's really the crux of the matter. When it comes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9367)|
| 2:36:15| your other question was don't we vote on our schedule? And the answer is no, we don't. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9375)|
| 2:36:21| is a whole list of things that at least from my experience when I became chair that you immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| do with the commission office of sitting down, working through the calendar, working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9386)|
| 2:36:30| the thing, going through, you know, the organization of the session, so to speak. But what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9390)|
| 2:36:36| getting to is exactly right. It's about the sort of what is the precedence versus what is actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9396)|
| 2:36:40| written. You're muted again, Commissioner Schmidt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9400)|
| 2:36:48| Oh, you're muted again, Commissioner Schmidt. You're muted. We could get into writing all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9408)|
| 2:36:53| kinds of scenarios out and have a 600 page rule book. I think we could set some fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9413)|
| 2:37:02| simple parameters which to work with then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9422)|
| 2:37:14| Commissioner Bustler and then Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9434)|
| 2:37:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair. This is looking like we've got a solution looking for a problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9437)|
| 2:37:25| If you have a problem with the water mechanism in the city county building, you have a PBA that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9445)|
| 2:37:32| controls the building in and of itself. If you need a special meeting for a, say, a natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9452)|
| 2:37:38| disaster, we have a process in that that we talked about in the rules committee in November that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9458)|
| 2:37:45| I was trying to say, you know, that we can call a special meeting, but in conjunction with both the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9465)|
| 2:37:52| mayor and the chairman that we were looking at. So there's a lot of things going on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9472)|
| 2:38:02| about, you know, who calls this and who calls what. And normally it takes care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9482)|
| 2:38:07| We've got a 9-1-1 commission that also sets up and does other things to, you know, put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9487)|
| 2:38:15| coordinating person in charge that coordinates all this. We need to let the process go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9495)|
| 2:38:22| We've got a way of handling natural disasters. We've got a way of handling, you know, a pandemic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9502)|
| 2:38:29| like what we're doing now. And I think we're just putting more things on that we really don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9509)|
| 2:38:36| because it's not made real clear, but we are handling it. And I think commissioners can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| handle their own problems. And look out here, we've got commissioners on here that would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9521)|
| 2:38:48| a suggestion on how to handle some of the problems. And that's what we're asked to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9528)|
| 2:38:57| to handle things like in our charter, which we normally do, we've got a place for a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9537)|
| 2:39:04| commission or a special, what we can call a special meeting. So I'm not sure why we're putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9544)|
| 2:39:12| extra rules in place when we can handle what we've got with what we've got in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9552)|
| 2:39:17| and in what we've been doing in the past. So that was my suggestion on it. And I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9557)|
| 2:39:24| other people to chime in to see what they have to say. We talked about a lot about it this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9564)|
| 2:39:33| So we'll lower my hand and listen to what else what other people have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9573)|
| 2:39:39| Thank you, Commissioner Wheeler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Well, I'm just a layman. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9579)|
| 2:39:47| I think first of all, it's important to know that the only reason that we are able to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9587)|
| 2:39:53| electronically is because the governor of our state put down an executive order that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| allows us to do that. The question is, in that sense, or in that instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9598)|
| 2:40:05| who decides whether we do meet electronically or in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| This is not something we could just do all the time. This is only in a season like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9610)|
| 2:40:18| Like I said, I'm a layman, but I don't think whether we choose to meet electronically or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9618)|
| 2:40:23| in person under such an order is a legislative issue. I think it's a rules issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9623)|
| 2:40:28| And I think the commission can vote one time and give the chairman the discretion to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9628)|
| 2:40:35| whether we do or don't meet electronically under such an order. Now, under normal circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9635)|
| 2:40:41| like Commissioner Smith brought up, even though we don't do it, it's probably wise that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| maybe vote on the calendar in September. I think there's three months that we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| November, December and March when we don't meet on the normal schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| But that could be taken care of with one vote at the beginning of the term year in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9655)|
| 2:41:02| So I just, again, I'll say for the third time, I'm just a layman, but under an executive order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9662)|
| 2:41:11| determining whether we meet in person or electronically, to have to convene the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9671)|
| 2:41:16| whole commission to make that decision just doesn't make any sense to me. I think it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| rules issue. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Beeler. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As Commissioner Smith said, we can do this vote by public form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9686)|
| 2:41:34| The chairman can put out on the first of the month, do you want to meet in person or do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9694)|
| 2:41:38| want to meet by Zoom? Majority rules. Each 11 commissioners will have a vote. As far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9698)|
| 2:41:45| calendar goes, our charter tells us when we meet. We meet the third and fourth Monday unless it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9705)|
| 2:41:50| a holiday. This year we did discuss the calendar. I do remember that we moved in March because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9710)|
| 2:41:56| the discussions brought up because of the third Monday would be spring break. So we moved it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9716)|
| 2:42:03| because of spring break. So yes, we did discuss it. Do we need jobs descriptions for chair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9723)|
| 2:42:14| vice chair, committee chairs and vice chairs? Probably. But we don't need to make this into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9734)|
| 2:42:21| a dictator type thing to where one person outrules 10. And we all got to vote. We all represent our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9741)|
| 2:42:31| 47,000 plus Chairman Jay and Commissioner Biggs represents the whole county, which is about 470,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9751)|
| 2:42:38| So we got to keep that in mind. Do I want to meet in person? I will say yes, especially on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9758)|
| 2:42:48| Zonings is our most contentious issue. We work today through rules. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9768)|
| 2:42:55| hopefully we can agree next month on rules that we're moving some things around to speed things up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9775)|
| 2:43:01| to where we will not have associates, employees here to 11, 12 o'clock at night. We'll get our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9781)|
| 2:43:06| business done. So hopefully that we'll discuss that next month. But for March, I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9786)|
| 2:43:13| that we go to public forum. Chairman Jay put out, do you want to meet in at the city county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9793)|
| 2:43:20| building where we spent $18,000 for plexiglass that I can't get anybody to say they approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9800)|
| 2:43:28| Or do we want to meet by Zoom? So that's my yeah, we need job descriptions. There's nothing wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9808)|
| 2:43:34| job descriptions. But we got to be careful that we work for the citizens. And we do not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9814)|
| 2:43:42| any chairman now or in the future to become some type of dictator. That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9822)|
| 2:43:50| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. And I did listen in on the rules committee this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9833)|
| 2:44:03| I'm very anxious about some of the changes proposed that will be brought to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9843)|
| 2:44:10| anxious in a good way, because I really appreciate what Commissioner Daley brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9850)|
| 2:44:17| in some ways to make it run more efficiently, and to be more conscientious of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9857)|
| 2:44:25| that other people, mainly other Knox County and Knox County school employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9865)|
| 2:44:34| at the time they have to spend at our meeting. So I really applaud you for that, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9874)|
| 2:44:39| Daley bringing that forward. On the other issue, though, as far as the scheduling of meetings and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9879)|
| 2:44:45| looking for basically exceptions to the rule, I do believe, from listening this afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9885)|
| 2:44:55| that the intent in bringing this forward was to just have a contingency plan for genuine emergencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9895)|
| 2:45:06| when it is not possible to have a special called meeting when the time frame isn't there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9906)|
| 2:45:13| or when just a last moment decision needs to be made anyway. It's not an effort to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9913)|
| 2:45:22| allow one person to have full control. It's just an effort to basically, I believe, just allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9922)|
| 2:45:32| whoever our chair is at that point in time, which keep in mind is someone that the majority of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9932)|
| 2:45:39| elected. So at some point in time, I think it's prudent that we demonstrate as a commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9939)|
| 2:45:48| collectively that we have some confidence in whoever that chair might be, that if a call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9948)|
| 2:45:55| needs to be made, and I'm not talking about for months and months out, but something needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9955)|
| 2:46:01| done on an emergency basis, a contingent plan needs to occur, and it just is not feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9961)|
| 2:46:11| to call us together collectively and have a vote that we allow our chair of our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9971)|
| 2:46:20| to make that kind of a decision. So I really, that was the intent that I had taken when it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9980)|
| 2:46:28| brought to us, and I don't know if this was Commissioner Jay's intent or not. I felt like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9988)|
| 2:46:36| it was, but just for clarification, I do not believe that it was any effort to try to skew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=9996)|
| 2:46:46| a huge amount of power toward one person. So I just wanted to share that that was my takeaway in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10006)|
| 2:46:55| this. Thank you, Commissioner Hill. You're spot on in your assumptions. Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10015)|
| 2:47:04| I'd like to meet in person, especially with the $18,000 we spent as well. I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10024)|
| 2:47:10| Commissioner Carson. The only question is, can we, since we're still underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10030)|
| 2:47:17| the governor's order, we can still have people zoom in, the public zoom in, or other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10037)|
| 2:47:23| zoom in? So if they don't feel comfortable coming down to commission, they can still participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10043)|
| 2:47:27| Is that an accurate assumption or no? It does, yes. My understanding is it is, and it requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10047)|
| 2:47:34| a little bit more coordination with IT, and it is certainly harder for commissioners to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10054)|
| 2:47:40| participate that way, but it is possible. We've done that when Commissioner Baylor was out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| and others before, so it could be done that way, yes. My main concern is, well, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10065)|
| 2:47:51| yes, one, but like the public, if the public wanted to zoom in, they still have the accessibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| to do so at this point in time. Yeah, it would, yes, it would be a bigger challenge for IT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10076)|
| 2:48:02| of course, if you had, say, 100 people wanting to zoom in at public forum, of course, but yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10082)|
| 2:48:08| I mean, we can make, we've made accommodations from day one in every possible scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10088)|
| 2:48:14| We have the best IT team in the state, so I have high confidence in their ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10094)|
| 2:48:18| So I'd like to be back in person. I miss everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10098)|
| 2:48:22| Commissioner Skidmaker? Thank you, Chairman Jay. Earlier, someone did mention that we do decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10102)|
| 2:48:30| what the yearly meeting schedule is at our September meeting so that Drew has time to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10110)|
| 2:48:38| get it together and get those dates approved by PBA and then, of course, add it to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10118)|
| 2:48:44| commission website. So we do decide when our meetings are. And, of course, they did bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10124)|
| 2:48:54| up the point, too, is we did change our standard meeting schedule to allow for spring break in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10134)|
| 2:49:01| March, which was a great idea. And then I do think that if we're going to, I like Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10141)|
| 2:49:07| Daly's suggestion to use the commission forum to decide whether we're going to meet in person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10147)|
| 2:49:14| or on Zoom. And I also appreciate the IT department updating all of our laptops so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10154)|
| 2:49:23| now we can raise hands like we can now where Commissioner Hill was having that problem before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10163)|
| 2:49:29| And if you'll also look at the reactions box, there's some additional features in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10169)|
| 2:49:34| that we may want to consider down the road if we have to meet by Zoom again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10174)|
| 2:49:43| And what's so funny, Mr. Beeler? Well, some of those choices in the reactions box are pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10183)|
| 2:49:51| funny, Commissioner. Yeah, I was referring to the green one and the red one. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10191)|
| 2:49:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Commissioner Smith? First, I just want to say this has been a hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10199)|
| 2:50:10| year. The six and a half years I've been on commission, this has been the toughest year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10210)|
| 2:50:16| because of cats. It's been a tough night. Because we have had to do so much of our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10216)|
| 2:50:29| in untraditional ways, in ways that don't allow us to actually be in the same room together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10229)|
| 2:50:36| And I guess it's a lot like the education process. Virtually, it's not as conducive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10236)|
| 2:50:42| as together. And it has probably kept us from being as tight of a group as we could be because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10242)|
| 2:50:51| we haven't had those moments in the same presence. Now, as far as moving forward with Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10251)|
| 2:50:59| I'll show you something. This is the only thing I like about Zoom. It allows me to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10259)|
| 2:51:10| two computer screens going and two computers. So I can get to a lot of information really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10270)|
| 2:51:18| But I would like for us to get back to, I am not a medical doctor. I've said that before in these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10278)|
| 2:51:24| meetings. I don't know where this is going completely. I do think that I can see this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10284)|
| 2:51:35| both ways. I can see a chairman having discretion for times like this. I can also see this is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| great use for the commission forum to where the chairman puts a suggestion and it takes six votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10301)|
| 2:51:56| on the forum for it to happen. I'm a pretty easygoing guy. I am like Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10316)|
| 2:52:06| I think these virtual meetings are a disadvantage to the zoning meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10326)|
| 2:52:14| But I'm pretty open. I just really wanted to express that I think that some of our issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10334)|
| 2:52:20| are caused by the circumstances we're in, because it's not conducive to bonding with your colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10340)|
| 2:52:28| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| No, thank you again, Mr. Chair. I just wanted to see if the law department had any directions for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| us or listening to the comments, if he has any opinion or maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10355)|
| 2:52:45| I don't think I see anybody from the law department with us anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10365)|
| 2:52:49| Maybe. They went home, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10369)|
| 2:52:52| I see Joe Rose and Roseburg, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10372)|
| 2:52:57| Well, all right. Hold that, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10377)|
| 2:53:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Haven't we discussed that there is a possibility of there being an updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10384)|
| 2:53:13| commission forum and that sort of thing? And I think wasn't there an issue before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10393)|
| 2:53:19| with people being able to get on forum and that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10399)|
| 2:53:25| I just remember forum being and there being some issues a few months ago, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10405)|
| 2:53:31| Yeah, there is a new and improved forum and commission entire web presence and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10411)|
| 2:53:37| design and functionality that we've worked on for several months with the IT department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| Unfortunately, it was very appropriately sidelined while they spent their time and effort to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10423)|
| 2:53:48| the vaccine sign up. And so it is still in the works and we will see it soon. There was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10428)|
| 2:53:54| issue also with people being able to sign on and that was helped by IT back and forth. I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10434)|
| 2:54:02| one of the larger issues, though, is most people just don't use it and respond. I have to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10442)|
| 2:54:10| the lack of response and communication on some things is really difficult because there have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10450)|
| 2:54:16| been several times where I have put stuff out on the forum asking for feedback or asking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10456)|
| 2:54:22| either gets a lot of looks but no replies or no replies and no looks. And it's just sort of a void| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10462)|
| 2:54:28| of a black hole for space. So I'm happy to continue to use that. I just want to encourage everybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10468)|
| 2:54:35| actually use it and participate in it in a way that is meaningful. Otherwise, it's just going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10475)|
| 2:54:40| me posting stuff and, you know, two people responding. So hopefully we'll have a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10480)|
| 2:54:45| interface soon. It'll be a little bit easier to notify everyone. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10485)|
| 2:54:50| And if I could just say for the record on that commission forum, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| I can speak for the four of us new folks that this wasn't something I don't think we totally got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10496)|
| 2:55:07| We totally, fully understood, you know, the mechanism of it. And that there was there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10507)|
| 2:55:13| a little bit of lack and communication in that to trying to figure out what it really was. And again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10513)|
| 2:55:21| that goes back to not being collectively together so much the time. But I will tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10521)|
| 2:55:30| in the beginning, you weren't intentionally ignored because I hadn't even figured it out yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10530)|
| 2:55:35| And I know I wasn't the only one. Thank you. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10535)|
| 2:55:42| Thank you, Chairman. So one of the things that I've noticed that our four new commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10542)|
| 2:55:48| haven't really had the opportunity to do is, you know, we had orientations in Murfreesboro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10548)|
| 2:55:54| we've had days on the Hill. And one of the things that I hate for you guys, but we will see change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10554)|
| 2:56:02| is the opportunity for community interaction, whenever you are meeting and going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10562)|
| 2:56:07| budgets and talking to people in the arts and things that can be beneficial throughout our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10567)|
| 2:56:12| entire community, that will really benefit your district in many different ways. Sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10572)|
| 2:56:20| the thing that I really like is seeing how these smaller projects impact us in a positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10580)|
| 2:56:26| direction. There's things that we can do that are absolutely nowhere near as big as some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10586)|
| 2:56:32| things like the Chaud Road extension and things of that nature, but it has an impact on a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10592)|
| 2:56:37| people. And I'm looking forward to getting back in person, mainly because, like Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10597)|
| 2:56:43| Daley stated, the zonings are so important. But as well as whenever we were physically there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10603)|
| 2:56:50| had a hybrid meeting, there were people that came that didn't sign up for public forum. And sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10610)|
| 2:56:56| during some of the meetings maybe we've all had in that last couple of weeks, we can see the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10616)|
| 2:57:01| importance of broadband and internet connection and things of that nature. So I'm looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10621)|
| 2:57:06| to it. I'm looking forward to us all being able to get back together. But more than anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10626)|
| 2:57:11| I'm looking forward to a new chapter for this new commission and us moving in a direction that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10631)|
| 2:57:16| we can all basically be an assistance to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10636)|
| 2:57:20| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. I don't see any other hands up, so I'll just kind of reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10640)|
| 2:57:26| a couple of quick things and then we'll close up our meeting tonight. As Commissioner Hill said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10646)|
| 2:57:32| very eloquently, much more than I, the intention of my conversation today in the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10652)|
| 2:57:38| and here tonight is purely clarification and trying to build a better commission. I hope to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10658)|
| 2:57:44| work through some of the documentation, go back to the Rules Committee and work with all of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10664)|
| 2:57:48| and see if we can codify some things. But it's not to create any authoritarian XYZ. It's to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10668)|
| 2:57:56| write down what has either been the norm or the tradition or the way things have worked and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10676)|
| 2:58:01| put it into something that makes it better for the next commissioner. I do think the next chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10681)|
| 2:58:07| the next vice chairman, the next commission, the more we can write some of this stuff down instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10687)|
| 2:58:11| of that's the way it's always been or just kind of assumptions, the more we can just sort of codify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10691)|
| 2:58:16| and write things down and outline the roles, responsibilities, it'll make us a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10696)|
| 2:58:20| commission. I mean, we didn't even, you know, several years ago, if you were a new commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10700)|
| 2:58:24| like I was, Commissioner Biggs, we came in at the same time, we got nothing. We literally got thrown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10704)|
| 2:58:29| in Murphy's Barrel for a day and a half with, you know, six pieces of paper and then we were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10709)|
| 2:58:35| we started making decisions. We didn't even have orientation. We didn't have any documentation. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| didn't have books. We've made it a little bit better and my goal as chairman, I said this from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| the very beginning, if I can help make commission just a little bit better, a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10723)|
| 2:58:48| organized, a little bit more fluid in the information, a little bit better or, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10728)|
| 2:58:51| prepared for the next term, that's my goal. And so I'm really hoping to just try to help outline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10731)|
| 2:58:57| the roles and responsibilities, outline how we can make a better chairman or a better commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10737)|
| 2:59:02| so that the next chairman and vice chairman and the next leadership can come in and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10742)|
| 2:59:06| oh, okay, I got it. Part of what we discussed today was I didn't even know half of the boards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10746)|
| 2:59:11| that the chairman was automatically on in the community until I became chair. So just writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10751)|
| 2:59:15| down like what to expect is kind of, at some point we don't even, you know, it's amazing. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210216?start=10755)|
